Utterance,Label
fellow citizens of the senate and of the house of representatives,1789-Washington
among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order and received on the 14th day of the present month,1789-Washington
on the one hand i was summoned by my country whose voice i can never hear but with veneration and love from a retreat which i had chosen with the fondest predilection and in my flattering hopes with an immutable decision as the asylum of my declining years a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more dear to me by the addition of habit to inclination and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time,1789-Washington
on the other hand the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications could not but overwhelm with despondence one who inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies,1789-Washington
in this conflict of emotions all i dare aver is that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected,1789-Washington
all i dare hope is that if in executing this task i have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of former instances or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof of the confidence of my fellow citizens and have thence too little consulted my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me my error will be palliated by the motives which mislead me and its consequences be judged by my country with some share of the partiality in which they originated,1789-Washington
such being the impressions under which i have in obedience to the public summons repaired to the present station it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this first official act my fervent supplications to that almighty being who rules over the universe who presides in the councils of nations and whose providential aids can supply every human defect that his benediction may consecrate to the liberties and happiness of the people of the united states a government instituted by themselves for these essential purposes and may enable every instrument employed in its administration to execute with success the functions allotted to his charge,1789-Washington
in tendering this homage to the great author of every public and private good i assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not less than my own nor those of my fellow citizens at large less than either,1789-Washington
no people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand which conducts the affairs of men more than those of the united states,1789-Washington
every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency and in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their united government the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from which the event has resulted can not be compared with the means by which most governments have been established without some return of pious gratitude along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage,1789-Washington
these reflections arising out of the present crisis have forced themselves too strongly on my mind to be suppressed,1789-Washington
you will join with me i trust in thinking that there are none under the influence of which the proceedings of a new and free government can more auspiciously commence,1789-Washington
by the article establishing the executive department it is made the duty of the president to recommend to your consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient,1789-Washington
the circumstances under which i now meet you will acquit me from entering into that subject further than to refer to the great constitutional charter under which you are assembled and which in defining your powers designates the objects to which your attention is to be given,1789-Washington
it will be more consistent with those circumstances and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me to substitute in place of a recommendation of particular measures the tribute that is due to the talents the rectitude and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them,1789-Washington
in these honorable qualifications i behold the surest pledges that as on one side no local prejudices or attachments no separate views nor party animosities will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests so on another that the foundation of our national policy will be laid in the pure and immutable principles of private morality and the preeminence of free government be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections of its citizens and command the respect of the world,1789-Washington
i dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for my country can inspire since there is no truth more thoroughly established than that there exists in the economy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness between duty and advantage between the genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy and the solid rewards of public prosperity and felicity since we ought to be no less persuaded that the propitious smiles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven itself has ordained and since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered perhaps as deeply as finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the american people,1789-Washington
besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care it will remain with your judgment to decide how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by the fifth article of the constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture by the nature of objections which have been urged against the system or by the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them,1789-Washington
instead of undertaking particular recommendations on this subject in which i could be guided by no lights derived from official opportunities i shall again give way to my entire confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good for i assure myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger the benefits of an united and effective government or which ought to await the future lessons of experience a reverence for the characteristic rights of freemen and a regard for the public harmony will sufficiently influence your deliberations on the question how far the former can be impregnably fortified or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted,1789-Washington
to the foregoing observations i have one to add which will be most properly addressed to the house of representatives,1789-Washington
it concerns myself and will therefore be as brief as possible,1789-Washington
when i was first honored with a call into the service of my country then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties the light in which i contemplated my duty required that i should renounce every pecuniary compensation,1789-Washington
from this resolution i have in no instance departed and being still under the impressions which produced it i must decline as inapplicable to myself any share in the personal emoluments which may be indispensably included in a permanent provision for the executive department and must accordingly pray that the pecuniary estimates for the station in which i am placed may during my continuance in it be limited to such actual expenditures as the public good may be thought to require,1789-Washington
having thus imparted to you my sentiments as they have been awakened by the occasion which brings us together i shall take my present leave but not without resorting once more to the benign parent of the human race in humble supplication that since he has been pleased to favor the american people with opportunities for deliberating in perfect tranquillity and dispositions for deciding with unparalleled unanimity on a form of government for the security of their union and the advancement of their happiness so his divine blessing may be equally conspicuous in the enlarged views the temperate consultations and the wise measures on which the success of this government must depend,1789-Washington
fellow citizens i am again called upon by the voice of my country to execute the functions of its chief magistrate,1793-Washington
when the occasion proper for it shall arrive i shall endeavor to express the high sense i entertain of this distinguished honor and of the confidence which has been reposed in me by the people of united america,1793-Washington
previous to the execution of any official act of the president the constitution requires an oath of office,1793-Washington
this oath i am now about to take and in your presence that if it shall be found during my administration of the government i have in any instance violated willingly or knowingly the injunctions thereof i may besides incurring constitutional punishment be subject to the upbraidings of all who are now witnesses of the present solemn ceremony,1793-Washington
when it was first perceived in early times that no middle course for america remained between unlimited submission to a foreign legislature and a total independence of its claims men of reflection were less apprehensive of danger from the formidable power of fleets and armies they must determine to resist than from those contests and dissensions which would certainly arise concerning the forms of government to be instituted over the whole and over the parts of this extensive country,1797-Adams
relying however on the purity of their intentions the justice of their cause and the integrity and intelligence of the people under an overruling providence which had so signally protected this country from the first the representatives of this nation then consisting of little more than half its present number not only broke to pieces the chains which were forging and the rod of iron that was lifted up but frankly cut asunder the ties which had bound them and launched into an ocean of uncertainty,1797-Adams
the zeal and ardor of the people during the revolutionary war supplying the place of government commanded a degree of order sufficient at least for the temporary preservation of society,1797-Adams
the confederation which was early felt to be necessary was prepared from the models of the batavian and helvetic confederacies the only examples which remain with any detail and precision in history and certainly the only ones which the people at large had ever considered,1797-Adams
but reflecting on the striking difference in so many particulars between this country and those where a courier may go from the seat of government to the frontier in a single day it was then certainly foreseen by some who assisted in congress at the formation of it that it could not be durable,1797-Adams
negligence of its regulations inattention to its recommendations if not disobedience to its authority not only in individuals but in states soon appeared with their melancholy consequences universal languor jealousies and rivalries of states decline of navigation and commerce discouragement of necessary manufactures universal fall in the value of lands and their produce contempt of public and private faith loss of consideration and credit with foreign nations and at length in discontents animosities combinations partial conventions and insurrection threatening some great national calamity,1797-Adams
in this dangerous crisis the people of america were not abandoned by their usual good sense presence of mind resolution or integrity,1797-Adams
measures were pursued to concert a plan to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty,1797-Adams
the public disquisitions discussions and deliberations issued in the present happy constitution of government,1797-Adams
employed in the service of my country abroad during the whole course of these transactions i first saw the constitution of the united states in a foreign country,1797-Adams
irritated by no literary altercation animated by no public debate heated by no party animosity i read it with great satisfaction as the result of good heads prompted by good hearts as an experiment better adapted to the genius character situation and relations of this nation and country than any which had ever been proposed or suggested,1797-Adams
in its general principles and great outlines it was conformable to such a system of government as i had ever most esteemed and in some states my own native state in particular had contributed to establish,1797-Adams
claiming a right of suffrage in common with my fellow citizens in the adoption or rejection of a constitution which was to rule me and my posterity as well as them and theirs i did not hesitate to express my approbation of it on all occasions in public and in private,1797-Adams
it was not then nor has been since any objection to it in my mind that the executive and senate were not more permanent,1797-Adams
nor have i ever entertained a thought of promoting any alteration in it but such as the people themselves in the course of their experience should see and feel to be necessary or expedient and by their representatives in congress and the state legislatures according to the constitution itself adopt and ordain,1797-Adams
returning to the bosom of my country after a painful separation from it for ten years i had the honor to be elected to a station under the new order of things and i have repeatedly laid myself under the most serious obligations to support the constitution,1797-Adams
the operation of it has equaled the most sanguine expectations of its friends and from an habitual attention to it satisfaction in its administration and delight in its effects upon the peace order prosperity and happiness of the nation i have acquired an habitual attachment to it and veneration for it,1797-Adams
what other form of government indeed can so well deserve our esteem and love,1797-Adams
there may be little solidity in an ancient idea that congregations of men into cities and nations are the most pleasing objects in the sight of superior intelligences but this is very certain that to a benevolent human mind there can be no spectacle presented by any nation more pleasing more noble majestic or august than an assembly like that which has so often been seen in this and the other chamber of congress of a government in which the executive authority as well as that of all the branches of the legislature are exercised by citizens selected at regular periods by their neighbors to make and execute laws for the general good,1797-Adams
can anything essential anything more than mere ornament and decoration be added to this by robes and diamonds,1797-Adams
can authority be more amiable and respectable when it descends from accidents or institutions established in remote antiquity than when it springs fresh from the hearts and judgments of an honest and enlightened people,1797-Adams
for it is the people only that are represented,1797-Adams
it is their power and majesty that is reflected and only for their good in every legitimate government under whatever form it may appear,1797-Adams
the existence of such a government as ours for any length of time is a full proof of a general dissemination of knowledge and virtue throughout the whole body of the people,1797-Adams
and what object or consideration more pleasing than this can be presented to the human mind,1797-Adams
if national pride is ever justifiable or excusable it is when it springs not from power or riches grandeur or glory but from conviction of national innocence information and benevolence,1797-Adams
in the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free fair virtuous and independent elections,1797-Adams
if an election is to be determined by a majority of a single vote and that can be procured by a party through artifice or corruption the government may be the choice of a party for its own ends not of the nation for the national good,1797-Adams
if that solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or menaces by fraud or violence by terror intrigue or venality the government may not be the choice of the american people but of foreign nations,1797-Adams
it may be foreign nations who govern us and not we the people who govern ourselves and candid men will acknowledge that in such cases choice would have little advantage to boast of over lot or chance,1797-Adams
such is the amiable and interesting system of government and such are some of the abuses to which it may be exposed which the people of america have exhibited to the admiration and anxiety of the wise and virtuous of all nations for eight years under the administration of a citizen who by a long course of great actions regulated by prudence justice temperance and fortitude conducting a people inspired with the same virtues and animated with the same ardent patriotism and love of liberty to independence and peace to increasing wealth and unexampled prosperity has merited the gratitude of his fellow citizens commanded the highest praises of foreign nations and secured immortal glory with posterity,1797-Adams
in that retirement which is his voluntary choice may he long live to enjoy the delicious recollection of his services the gratitude of mankind the happy fruits of them to himself and the world which are daily increasing and that splendid prospect of the future fortunes of this country which is opening from year to year,1797-Adams
his name may be still a rampart and the knowledge that he lives a bulwark against all open or secret enemies of his country s peace,1797-Adams
this example has been recommended to the imitation of his successors by both houses of congress and by the voice of the legislatures and the people throughout the nation,1797-Adams
on this subject it might become me better to be silent or to speak with diffidence but as something may be expected the occasion i hope will be admitted as an apology if i venture to say that if a preference upon principle of a free republican government formed upon long and serious reflection after a diligent and impartial inquiry after truth if an attachment to the constitution of the united states and a conscientious determination to support it until it shall be altered by the judgments and wishes of the people expressed in the mode prescribed in it if a respectful attention to the constitutions of the individual states and a constant caution and delicacy toward the state governments if an equal and impartial regard to the rights interest honor and happiness of all the states in the union without preference or regard to a northern or southern an eastern or western position their various political opinions on unessential points or their personal attachments if a love of virtuous men of all parties and denominations if a love of science and letters and a wish to patronize every rational effort to encourage schools colleges universities academies and every institution for propagating knowledge virtue and religion among all classes of the people not only for their benign influence on the happiness of life in all its stages and classes and of society in all its forms but as the only means of preserving our constitution from its natural enemies the spirit of sophistry the spirit of party the spirit of intrigue the profligacy of corruption and the pestilence of foreign influence which is the angel of destruction to elective governments if a love of equal laws of justice and humanity in the interior administration if an inclination to improve agriculture commerce and manufacturers for necessity convenience and defense if a spirit of equity and humanity toward the aboriginal nations of america and a disposition to meliorate their condition by inclining them to be more friendly to us and our citizens to be more friendly to them if an inflexible determination to maintain peace and inviolable faith with all nations and that system of neutrality and impartiality among the belligerent powers of europe which has been adopted by this government and so solemnly sanctioned by both houses of congress and applauded by the legislatures of the states and the public opinion until it shall be otherwise ordained by congress if a personal esteem for the french nation formed in a residence of seven years chiefly among them and a sincere desire to preserve the friendship which has been so much for the honor and interest of both nations if while the conscious honor and integrity of the people of america and the internal sentiment of their own power and energies must be preserved an earnest endeavor to investigate every just cause and remove every colorable pretense of complaint if an intention to pursue by amicable negotiation a reparation for the injuries that have been committed on the commerce of our fellow citizens by whatever nation and if success can not be obtained to lay the facts before the legislature that they may consider what further measures the honor and interest of the government and its constituents demand if a resolution to do justice as far as may depend upon me at all times and to all nations and maintain peace friendship and benevolence with all the world if an unshaken confidence in the honor spirit and resources of the american people on which i have so often hazarded my all and never been deceived if elevated ideas of the high destinies of this country and of my own duties toward it founded on a knowledge of the moral principles and intellectual improvements of the people deeply engraven on my mind in early life and not obscured but exalted by experience and age and with humble reverence i feel it to be my duty to add if a veneration for the religion of a people who profess and call themselves christians and a fixed resolution to consider a decent respect for christianity among the best recommendations for the public service can enable me in any degree to comply with your wishes it shall be my strenuous endeavor that this sagacious injunction of the two houses shall not be without effect,1797-Adams
with this great example before me with the sense and spirit the faith and honor the duty and interest of the same american people pledged to support the constitution of the united states i entertain no doubt of its continuance in all its energy and my mind is prepared without hesitation to lay myself under the most solemn obligations to support it to the utmost of my power,1797-Adams
and may that being who is supreme over all the patron of order the fountain of justice and the protector in all ages of the world of virtuous liberty continue his blessing upon this nation and its government and give it all possible success and duration consistent with the ends of his providence,1797-Adams
friends and fellow citizens,1801-Jefferson
called upon to undertake the duties of the first executive office of our country i avail myself of the presence of that portion of my fellow citizens which is here assembled to express my grateful thanks for the favor with which they have been pleased to look toward me to declare a sincere consciousness that the task is above my talents and that i approach it with those anxious and awful presentiments which the greatness of the charge and the weakness of my powers so justly inspire,1801-Jefferson
a rising nation spread over a wide and fruitful land traversing all the seas with the rich productions of their industry engaged in commerce with nations who feel power and forget right advancing rapidly to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye when i contemplate these transcendent objects and see the honor the happiness and the hopes of this beloved country committed to the issue and the auspices of this day i shrink from the contemplation and humble myself before the magnitude of the undertaking,1801-Jefferson
utterly indeed should i despair did not the presence of many whom i here see remind me that in the other high authorities provided by our constitution i shall find resources of wisdom of virtue and of zeal on which to rely under all difficulties,1801-Jefferson
to you then gentlemen who are charged with the sovereign functions of legislation and to those associated with you i look with encouragement for that guidance and support which may enable us to steer with safety the vessel in which we are all embarked amidst the conflicting elements of a troubled world,1801-Jefferson
during the contest of opinion through which we have passed the animation of discussions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might impose on strangers unused to think freely and to speak and to write what they think but this being now decided by the voice of the nation announced according to the rules of the constitution all will of course arrange themselves under the will of the law and unite in common efforts for the common good,1801-Jefferson
all too will bear in mind this sacred principle that though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail that will to be rightful must be reasonable that the minority possess their equal rights which equal law must protect and to violate would be oppression,1801-Jefferson
let us then fellow citizens unite with one heart and one mind,1801-Jefferson
let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things,1801-Jefferson
and let us reflect that having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic as wicked and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions,1801-Jefferson
during the throes and convulsions of the ancient world during the agonizing spasms of infuriated man seeking through blood and slaughter his long lost liberty it was not wonderful that the agitation of the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful shore that this should be more felt and feared by some and less by others and should divide opinions as to measures of safety,1801-Jefferson
but every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle,1801-Jefferson
we have called by different names brethren of the same principle,1801-Jefferson
we are all republicans we are all federalists,1801-Jefferson
if there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican form let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it,1801-Jefferson
i know indeed that some honest men fear that a republican government can not be strong that this government is not strong enough but would the honest patriot in the full tide of successful experiment abandon a government which has so far kept us free and firm on the theoretic and visionary fear that this government the world s best hope may by possibility want energy to preserve itself,1801-Jefferson
i trust not,1801-Jefferson
i believe this on the contrary the strongest government on earth,1801-Jefferson
i believe it the only one where every man at the call of the law would fly to the standard of the law and would meet invasions of the public order as his own personal concern,1801-Jefferson
sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself,1801-Jefferson
can he then be trusted with the government of others,1801-Jefferson
or have we found angels in the forms of kings to govern him,1801-Jefferson
let history answer this question,1801-Jefferson
let us then with courage and confidence pursue our own federal and republican principles our attachment to union and representative government,1801-Jefferson
kindly separated by nature and a wide ocean from the exterminating havoc of one quarter of the globe too high minded to endure the degradations of the others possessing a chosen country with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth generation entertaining a due sense of our equal right to the use of our own faculties to the acquisitions of our own industry to honor and confidence from our fellow citizens resulting not from birth but from our actions and their sense of them enlightened by a benign religion professed indeed and practiced in various forms yet all of them inculcating honesty truth temperance gratitude and the love of man acknowledging and adoring an overruling providence which by all its dispensations proves that it delights in the happiness of man here and his greater happiness hereafter with all these blessings what more is necessary to make us a happy and a prosperous people,1801-Jefferson
still one thing more fellow citizens a wise and frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned,1801-Jefferson
this is the sum of good government and this is necessary to close the circle of our felicities,1801-Jefferson
about to enter fellow citizens on the exercise of duties which comprehend everything dear and valuable to you it is proper you should understand what i deem the essential principles of our government and consequently those which ought to shape its administration,1801-Jefferson
i will compress them within the narrowest compass they will bear stating the general principle but not all its limitations,1801-Jefferson
equal and exact justice to all men of whatever state or persuasion religious or political peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances with none the support of the state governments in all their rights as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies the preservation of the general government in its whole constitutional vigor as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad a jealous care of the right of election by the people a mild and safe corrective of abuses which are lopped by the sword of revolution where peaceable remedies are unprovided absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority the vital principle of republics from which is no appeal but to force the vital principle and immediate parent of despotism a well disciplined militia our best reliance in peace and for the first moments of war till regulars may relieve them the supremacy of the civil over the military authority economy in the public expense that labor may be lightly burthened the honest payment of our debts and sacred preservation of the public faith encouragement of agriculture and of commerce as its handmaid the diffusion of information and arraignment of all abuses at the bar of the public reason freedom of religion freedom of the press and freedom of person under the protection of the habeas corpus and trial by juries impartially selected,1801-Jefferson
these principles form the bright constellation which has gone before us and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation,1801-Jefferson
the wisdom of our sages and blood of our heroes have been devoted to their attainment,1801-Jefferson
they should be the creed of our political faith the text of civic instruction the touchstone by which to try the services of those we trust and should we wander from them in moments of error or of alarm let us hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road which alone leads to peace liberty and safety,1801-Jefferson
i repair then fellow citizens to the post you have assigned me,1801-Jefferson
with experience enough in subordinate offices to have seen the difficulties of this the greatest of all i have learnt to expect that it will rarely fall to the lot of imperfect man to retire from this station with the reputation and the favor which bring him into it,1801-Jefferson
without pretensions to that high confidence you reposed in our first and greatest revolutionary character whose preeminent services had entitled him to the first place in his country s love and destined for him the fairest page in the volume of faithful history i ask so much confidence only as may give firmness and effect to the legal administration of your affairs,1801-Jefferson
i shall often go wrong through defect of judgment,1801-Jefferson
when right i shall often be thought wrong by those whose positions will not command a view of the whole ground,1801-Jefferson
i ask your indulgence for my own errors which will never be intentional and your support against the errors of others who may condemn what they would not if seen in all its parts,1801-Jefferson
the approbation implied by your suffrage is a great consolation to me for the past and my future solicitude will be to retain the good opinion of those who have bestowed it in advance to conciliate that of others by doing them all the good in my power and to be instrumental to the happiness and freedom of all,1801-Jefferson
relying then on the patronage of your good will i advance with obedience to the work ready to retire from it whenever you become sensible how much better choice it is in your power to make,1801-Jefferson
and may that infinite power which rules the destinies of the universe lead our councils to what is best and give them a favorable issue for your peace and prosperity,1801-Jefferson
proceeding fellow citizens to that qualification which the constitution requires before my entrance on the charge again conferred on me it is my duty to express the deep sense i entertain of this new proof of confidence from my fellow citizens at large and the zeal with which it inspires me so to conduct myself as may best satisfy their just expectations,1805-Jefferson
on taking this station on a former occasion i declared the principles on which i believed it my duty to administer the affairs of our commonwealth,1805-Jefferson
my conscience tells me i have on every occasion acted up to that declaration according to its obvious import and to the understanding of every candid mind,1805-Jefferson
in the transaction of your foreign affairs we have endeavored to cultivate the friendship of all nations and especially of those with which we have the most important relations,1805-Jefferson
we have done them justice on all occasions favored where favor was lawful and cherished mutual interests and intercourse on fair and equal terms,1805-Jefferson
we are firmly convinced and we act on that conviction that with nations as with individuals our interests soundly calculated will ever be found inseparable from our moral duties and history bears witness to the fact that a just nation is trusted on its word when recourse is had to armaments and wars to bridle others,1805-Jefferson
at home fellow citizens you best know whether we have done well or ill,1805-Jefferson
the suppression of unnecessary offices of useless establishments and expenses enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes,1805-Jefferson
these covering our land with officers and opening our doors to their intrusions had already begun that process of domiciliary vexation which once entered is scarcely to be restrained from reaching successively every article of property and produce,1805-Jefferson
if among these taxes some minor ones fell which had not been inconvenient it was because their amount would not have paid the officers who collected them and because if they had any merit the state authorities might adopt them instead of others less approved,1805-Jefferson
the remaining revenue on the consumption of foreign articles is paid chiefly by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries to domestic comforts being collected on our seaboard and frontiers only and incorporated with the transactions of our mercantile citizens it may be the pleasure and the pride of an american to ask what farmer what mechanic what laborer ever sees a taxgatherer of the united states,1805-Jefferson
these contributions enable us to support the current expenses of the government to fulfill contracts with foreign nations to extinguish the native right of soil within our limits to extend those limits and to apply such a surplus to our public debts as places at a short day their final redemption and that redemption once effected the revenue thereby liberated may by a just repartition of it among the states and a corresponding amendment of the constitution be applied in time of peace to rivers canals roads arts manufactures education and other great objects within each state,1805-Jefferson
in time of war if injustice by ourselves or others must sometimes produce war increased as the same revenue will be by increased population and consumption and aided by other resources reserved for that crisis it may meet within the year all the expenses of the year without encroaching on the rights of future generations by burthening them with the debts of the past,1805-Jefferson
war will then be but a suspension of useful works and a return to a state of peace a return to the progress of improvement,1805-Jefferson
i have said fellow citizens that the income reserved had enabled us to extend our limits but that extension may possibly pay for itself before we are called on and in the meantime may keep down the accruing interest in all events it will replace the advances we shall have made,1805-Jefferson
i know that the acquisition of louisiana had been disapproved by some from a candid apprehension that the enlargement of our territory would endanger its union,1805-Jefferson
but who can limit the extent to which the federative principle may operate effectively,1805-Jefferson
the larger our association the less will it be shaken by local passions and in any view is it not better that the opposite bank of the mississippi should be settled by our own brethren and children than by strangers of another family,1805-Jefferson
with which should we be most likely to live in harmony and friendly intercourse,1805-Jefferson
in matters of religion i have considered that its free exercise is placed by the constitution independent of the powers of the general government,1805-Jefferson
i have therefore undertaken on no occasion to prescribe the religious exercises suited to it but have left them as the constitution found them under the direction and discipline of the church or state authorities acknowledged by the several religious societies,1805-Jefferson
the aboriginal inhabitants of these countries i have regarded with the commiseration their history inspires,1805-Jefferson
endowed with the faculties and the rights of men breathing an ardent love of liberty and independence and occupying a country which left them no desire but to be undisturbed the stream of overflowing population from other regions directed itself on these shores without power to divert or habits to contend against it they have been overwhelmed by the current or driven before it now reduced within limits too narrow for the hunter s state humanity enjoins us to teach them agriculture and the domestic arts to encourage them to that industry which alone can enable them to maintain their place in existence and to prepare them in time for that state of society which to bodily comforts adds the improvement of the mind and morals,1805-Jefferson
we have therefore liberally furnished them with the implements of husbandry and household use we have placed among them instructors in the arts of first necessity and they are covered with the aegis of the law against aggressors from among ourselves,1805-Jefferson
but the endeavors to enlighten them on the fate which awaits their present course of life to induce them to exercise their reason follow its dictates and change their pursuits with the change of circumstances have powerful obstacles to encounter they are combated by the habits of their bodies prejudices of their minds ignorance pride and the influence of interested and crafty individuals among them who feel themselves something in the present order of things and fear to become nothing in any other,1805-Jefferson
these persons inculcate a sanctimonious reverence for the customs of their ancestors that whatsoever they did must be done through all time that reason is a false guide and to advance under its counsel in their physical moral or political condition is perilous innovation that their duty is to remain as their creator made them ignorance being safety and knowledge full of danger in short my friends among them also is seen the action and counteraction of good sense and of bigotry they too have their antiphilosophists who find an interest in keeping things in their present state who dread reformation and exert all their faculties to maintain the ascendancy of habit over the duty of improving our reason and obeying its mandates,1805-Jefferson
in giving these outlines i do not mean fellow citizens to arrogate to myself the merit of the measures,1805-Jefferson
that is due in the first place to the reflecting character of our citizens at large who by the weight of public opinion influence and strengthen the public measures,1805-Jefferson
it is due to the sound discretion with which they select from among themselves those to whom they confide the legislative duties,1805-Jefferson
it is due to the zeal and wisdom of the characters thus selected who lay the foundations of public happiness in wholesome laws the execution of which alone remains for others and it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries whose patriotism has associated them with me in the executive functions,1805-Jefferson
during this course of administration and in order to disturb it the artillery of the press has been leveled against us charged with whatsoever its licentiousness could devise or dare,1805-Jefferson
these abuses of an institution so important to freedom and science are deeply to be regretted inasmuch as they tend to lessen its usefulness and to sap its safety,1805-Jefferson
they might indeed have been corrected by the wholesome punishments reserved to and provided by the laws of the several states against falsehood and defamation but public duties more urgent press on the time of public servants and the offenders have therefore been left to find their punishment in the public indignation,1805-Jefferson
nor was it uninteresting to the world that an experiment should be fairly and fully made whether freedom of discussion unaided by power is not sufficient for the propagation and protection of truth whether a government conducting itself in the true spirit of its constitution with zeal and purity and doing no act which it would be unwilling the whole world should witness can be written down by falsehood and defamation,1805-Jefferson
the experiment has been tried you have witnessed the scene our fellow citizens looked on cool and collected they saw the latent source from which these outrages proceeded they gathered around their public functionaries and when the constitution called them to the decision by suffrage they pronounced their verdict honorable to those who had served them and consolatory to the friend of man who believes that he may be trusted with the control of his own affairs,1805-Jefferson
no inference is here intended that the laws provided by the states against false and defamatory publications should not be enforced he who has time renders a service to public morals and public tranquillity in reforming these abuses by the salutary coercions of the law but the experiment is noted to prove that since truth and reason have maintained their ground against false opinions in league with false facts the press confined to truth needs no other legal restraint the public judgment will correct false reasoning and opinions on a full hearing of all parties and no other definite line can be drawn between the inestimable liberty of the press and its demoralizing licentiousness,1805-Jefferson
if there be still improprieties which this rule would not restrain its supplement must be sought in the censorship of public opinion,1805-Jefferson
contemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so generally as auguring harmony and happiness to our future course i offer to our country sincere congratulations,1805-Jefferson
with those too not yet rallied to the same point the disposition to do so is gaining strength facts are piercing through the veil drawn over them and our doubting brethren will at length see that the mass of their fellow citizens with whom they can not yet resolve to act as to principles and measures think as they think and desire what they desire that our wish as well as theirs is that the public efforts may be directed honestly to the public good that peace be cultivated civil and religious liberty unassailed law and order preserved equality of rights maintained and that state of property equal or unequal which results to every man from his own industry or that of his father s,1805-Jefferson
when satisfied of these views it is not in human nature that they should not approve and support them,1805-Jefferson
in the meantime let us cherish them with patient affection let us do them justice and more than justice in all competitions of interest and we need not doubt that truth reason and their own interests will at length prevail will gather them into the fold of their country and will complete that entire union of opinion which gives to a nation the blessing of harmony and the benefit of all its strength,1805-Jefferson
i shall now enter on the duties to which my fellow citizens have again called me and shall proceed in the spirit of those principles which they have approved,1805-Jefferson
i fear not that any motives of interest may lead me astray i am sensible of no passion which could seduce me knowingly from the path of justice but the weaknesses of human nature and the limits of my own understanding will produce errors of judgment sometimes injurious to your interests,1805-Jefferson
i shall need therefore all the indulgence which i have heretofore experienced from my constituents the want of it will certainly not lessen with increasing years,1805-Jefferson
i shall need too the favor of that being in whose hands we are who led our fathers as israel of old from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries and comforts of life who has covered our infancy with his providence and our riper years with his wisdom and power and to whose goodness i ask you to join in supplications with me that he will so enlighten the minds of your servants guide their councils and prosper their measures that whatsoever they do shall result in your good and shall secure to you the peace friendship and approbation of all nations,1805-Jefferson
unwilling to depart from examples of the most revered authority i avail myself of the occasion now presented to express the profound impression made on me by the call of my country to the station to the duties of which i am about to pledge myself by the most solemn of sanctions,1809-Madison
so distinguished a mark of confidence proceeding from the deliberate and tranquil suffrage of a free and virtuous nation would under any circumstances have commanded my gratitude and devotion as well as filled me with an awful sense of the trust to be assumed,1809-Madison
under the various circumstances which give peculiar solemnity to the existing period i feel that both the honor and the responsibility allotted to me are inexpressibly enhanced,1809-Madison
the present situation of the world is indeed without a parallel and that of our own country full of difficulties,1809-Madison
the pressure of these too is the more severely felt because they have fallen upon us at a moment when the national prosperity being at a height not before attained the contrast resulting from the change has been rendered the more striking,1809-Madison
under the benign influence of our republican institutions and the maintenance of peace with all nations whilst so many of them were engaged in bloody and wasteful wars the fruits of a just policy were enjoyed in an unrivaled growth of our faculties and resources,1809-Madison
proofs of this were seen in the improvements of agriculture in the successful enterprises of commerce in the progress of manufacturers and useful arts in the increase of the public revenue and the use made of it in reducing the public debt and in the valuable works and establishments everywhere multiplying over the face of our land,1809-Madison
it is a precious reflection that the transition from this prosperous condition of our country to the scene which has for some time been distressing us is not chargeable on any unwarrantable views nor as i trust on any involuntary errors in the public councils,1809-Madison
indulging no passions which trespass on the rights or the repose of other nations it has been the true glory of the united states to cultivate peace by observing justice and to entitle themselves to the respect of the nations at war by fulfilling their neutral obligations with the most scrupulous impartiality,1809-Madison
if there be candor in the world the truth of these assertions will not be questioned posterity at least will do justice to them,1809-Madison
this unexceptionable course could not avail against the injustice and violence of the belligerent powers,1809-Madison
in their rage against each other or impelled by more direct motives principles of retaliation have been introduced equally contrary to universal reason and acknowledged law,1809-Madison
how long their arbitrary edicts will be continued in spite of the demonstrations that not even a pretext for them has been given by the united states and of the fair and liberal attempt to induce a revocation of them can not be anticipated,1809-Madison
assuring myself that under every vicissitude the determined spirit and united councils of the nation will be safeguards to its honor and its essential interests i repair to the post assigned me with no other discouragement than what springs from my own inadequacy to its high duties,1809-Madison
if i do not sink under the weight of this deep conviction it is because i find some support in a consciousness of the purposes and a confidence in the principles which i bring with me into this arduous service,1809-Madison
to cherish peace and friendly intercourse with all nations having correspondent dispositions to maintain sincere neutrality toward belligerent nations to prefer in all cases amicable discussion and reasonable accommodation of differences to a decision of them by an appeal to arms to exclude foreign intrigues and foreign partialities so degrading to all countries and so baneful to free ones to foster a spirit of independence too just to invade the rights of others too proud to surrender our own too liberal to indulge unworthy prejudices ourselves and too elevated not to look down upon them in others to hold the union of the states as the basis of their peace and happiness to support the constitution which is the cement of the union as well in its limitations as in its authorities to respect the rights and authorities reserved to the states and to the people as equally incorporated with and essential to the success of the general system to avoid the slightest interference with the right of conscience or the functions of religion so wisely exempted from civil jurisdiction to preserve in their full energy the other salutary provisions in behalf of private and personal rights and of the freedom of the press to observe economy in public expenditures to liberate the public resources by an honorable discharge of the public debts to keep within the requisite limits a standing military force always remembering that an armed and trained militia is the firmest bulwark of republics that without standing armies their liberty can never be in danger nor with large ones safe to promote by authorized means improvements friendly to agriculture to manufactures and to external as well as internal commerce to favor in like manner the advancement of science and the diffusion of information as the best aliment to true liberty to carry on the benevolent plans which have been so meritoriously applied to the conversion of our aboriginal neighbors from the degradation and wretchedness of savage life to a participation of the improvements of which the human mind and manners are susceptible in a civilized state as far as sentiments and intentions such as these can aid the fulfillment of my duty they will be a resource which can not fail me,1809-Madison
it is my good fortune moreover to have the path in which i am to tread lighted by examples of illustrious services successfully rendered in the most trying difficulties by those who have marched before me,1809-Madison
of those of my immediate predecessor it might least become me here to speak,1809-Madison
i may however be pardoned for not suppressing the sympathy with which my heart is full in the rich reward he enjoys in the benedictions of a beloved country gratefully bestowed or exalted talents zealously devoted through a long career to the advancement of its highest interest and happiness,1809-Madison
but the source to which i look or the aids which alone can supply my deficiencies is in the well tried intelligence and virtue of my fellow citizens and in the counsels of those representing them in the other departments associated in the care of the national interests,1809-Madison
in these my confidence will under every difficulty be best placed next to that which we have all been encouraged to feel in the guardianship and guidance of that almighty being whose power regulates the destiny of nations whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensed to this rising republic and to whom we are bound to address our devout gratitude for the past as well as our fervent supplications and best hopes for the future,1809-Madison
about to add the solemnity of an oath to the obligations imposed by a second call to the station in which my country heretofore placed me i find in the presence of this respectable assembly an opportunity of publicly repeating my profound sense of so distinguished a confidence and of the responsibility united with it,1813-Madison
the impressions on me are strengthened by such an evidence that my faithful endeavors to discharge my arduous duties have been favorably estimated and by a consideration of the momentous period at which the trust has been renewed,1813-Madison
from the weight and magnitude now belonging to it i should be compelled to shrink if i had less reliance on the support of an enlightened and generous people and felt less deeply a conviction that the war with a powerful nation which forms so prominent a feature in our situation is stamped with that justice which invites the smiles of heaven on the means of conducting it to a successful termination,1813-Madison
may we not cherish this sentiment without presumption when we reflect on the characters by which this war is distinguished,1813-Madison
it was not declared on the part of the united states until it had been long made on them in reality though not in name until arguments and postulations had been exhausted until a positive declaration had been received that the wrongs provoking it would not be discontinued nor until this last appeal could no longer be delayed without breaking down the spirit of the nation destroying all confidence in itself and in its political institutions and either perpetuating a state of disgraceful suffering or regaining by more costly sacrifices and more severe struggles our lost rank and respect among independent powers,1813-Madison
on the issue of the war are staked our national sovereignty on the high seas and the security of an important class of citizens whose occupations give the proper value to those of every other class,1813-Madison
not to contend for such a stake is to surrender our equality with other powers on the element common to all and to violate the sacred title which every member of the society has to its protection,1813-Madison
i need not call into view the unlawfulness of the practice by which our mariners are forced at the will of every cruising officer from their own vessels into foreign ones nor paint the outrages inseparable from it,1813-Madison
the proofs are in the records of each successive administration of our government and the cruel sufferings of that portion of the american people have found their way to every bosom not dead to the sympathies of human nature,1813-Madison
as the war was just in its origin and necessary and noble in its objects we can reflect with a proud satisfaction that in carrying it on no principle of justice or honor no usage of civilized nations no precept of courtesy or humanity have been infringed,1813-Madison
the war has been waged on our part with scrupulous regard to all these obligations and in a spirit of liberality which was never surpassed,1813-Madison
how little has been the effect of this example on the conduct of the enemy,1813-Madison
they have retained as prisoners of war citizens of the united states not liable to be so considered under the usages of war,1813-Madison
they have refused to consider as prisoners of war and threatened to punish as traitors and deserters persons emigrating without restraint to the united states incorporated by naturalization into our political family and fighting under the authority of their adopted country in open and honorable war for the maintenance of its rights and safety,1813-Madison
such is the avowed purpose of a government which is in the practice of naturalizing by thousands citizens of other countries and not only of permitting but compelling them to fight its battles against their native country,1813-Madison
they have not it is true taken into their own hands the hatchet and the knife devoted to indiscriminate massacre but they have let loose the savages armed with these cruel instruments have allured them into their service and carried them to battle by their sides eager to glut their savage thirst with the blood of the vanquished and to finish the work of torture and death on maimed and defenseless captives,1813-Madison
and what was never before seen british commanders have extorted victory over the unconquerable valor of our troops by presenting to the sympathy of their chief captives awaiting massacre from their savage associates,1813-Madison
and now we find them in further contempt of the modes of honorable warfare supplying the place of a conquering force by attempts to disorganize our political society to dismember our confederated republic,1813-Madison
happily like others these will recoil on the authors but they mark the degenerate counsels from which they emanate and if they did not belong to a sense of unexampled inconsistencies might excite the greater wonder as proceeding from a government which founded the very war in which it has been so long engaged on a charge against the disorganizing and insurrectional policy of its adversary,1813-Madison
to render the justice of the war on our part the more conspicuous the reluctance to commence it was followed by the earliest and strongest manifestations of a disposition to arrest its progress,1813-Madison
the sword was scarcely out of the scabbard before the enemy was apprised of the reasonable terms on which it would be resheathed,1813-Madison
still more precise advances were repeated and have been received in a spirit forbidding every reliance not placed on the military resources of the nation,1813-Madison
these resources are amply sufficient to bring the war to an honorable issue,1813-Madison
our nation is in number more than half that of the british isles,1813-Madison
it is composed of a brave a free a virtuous and an intelligent people,1813-Madison
our country abounds in the necessaries the arts and the comforts of life,1813-Madison
a general prosperity is visible in the public countenance,1813-Madison
the means employed by the british cabinet to undermine it have recoiled on themselves have given to our national faculties a more rapid development and draining or diverting the precious metals from british circulation and british vaults have poured them into those of the united states,1813-Madison
it is a propitious consideration that an unavoidable war should have found this seasonable facility for the contributions required to support it,1813-Madison
when the public voice called for war all knew and still know that without them it could not be carried on through the period which it might last and the patriotism the good sense and the manly spirit of our fellow citizens are pledges for the cheerfulness with which they will bear each his share of the common burden,1813-Madison
to render the war short and its success sure animated and systematic exertions alone are necessary and the success of our arms now may long preserve our country from the necessity of another resort to them,1813-Madison
already have the gallant exploits of our naval heroes proved to the world our inherent capacity to maintain our rights on one element,1813-Madison
if the reputation of our arms has been thrown under clouds on the other presaging flashes of heroic enterprise assure us that nothing is wanting to correspondent triumphs there also but the discipline and habits which are in daily progress,1813-Madison
i should be destitute of feeling if i was not deeply affected by the strong proof which my fellow citizens have given me of their confidence in calling me to the high office whose functions i am about to assume,1817-Monroe
as the expression of their good opinion of my conduct in the public service i derive from it a gratification which those who are conscious of having done all that they could to merit it can alone feel,1817-Monroe
my sensibility is increased by a just estimate of the importance of the trust and of the nature and extent of its duties with the proper discharge of which the highest interests of a great and free people are intimately connected,1817-Monroe
conscious of my own deficiency i cannot enter on these duties without great anxiety for the result,1817-Monroe
from a just responsibility i will never shrink calculating with confidence that in my best efforts to promote the public welfare my motives will always be duly appreciated and my conduct be viewed with that candor and indulgence which i have experienced in other stations,1817-Monroe
in commencing the duties of the chief executive office it has been the practice of the distinguished men who have gone before me to explain the principles which would govern them in their respective administrations,1817-Monroe
in following their venerated example my attention is naturally drawn to the great causes which have contributed in a principal degree to produce the present happy condition of the united states,1817-Monroe
they will best explain the nature of our duties and shed much light on the policy which ought to be pursued in future,1817-Monroe
from the commencement of our revolution to the present day almost forty years have elapsed and from the establishment of this constitution twenty eight,1817-Monroe
through this whole term the government has been what may emphatically be called self government,1817-Monroe
and what has been the effect,1817-Monroe
to whatever object we turn our attention whether it relates to our foreign or domestic concerns we find abundant cause to felicitate ourselves in the excellence of our institutions,1817-Monroe
during a period fraught with difficulties and marked by very extraordinary events the united states have flourished beyond example,1817-Monroe
their citizens individually have been happy and the nation prosperous,1817-Monroe
under this constitution our commerce has been wisely regulated with foreign nations and between the states new states have been admitted into our union our territory has been enlarged by fair and honorable treaty and with great advantage to the original states the states respectively protected by the national government under a mild parental system against foreign dangers and enjoying within their separate spheres by a wise partition of power a just proportion of the sovereignty have improved their police extended their settlements and attained a strength and maturity which are the best proofs of wholesome laws well administered,1817-Monroe
and if we look to the condition of individuals what a proud spectacle does it exhibit,1817-Monroe
on whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our union,1817-Monroe
who has been deprived of any right of person or property,1817-Monroe
who restrained from offering his vows in the mode which he prefers to the divine author of his being,1817-Monroe
it is well known that all these blessings have been enjoyed in their fullest extent and i add with peculiar satisfaction that there has been no example of a capital punishment being inflicted on anyone for the crime of high treason,1817-Monroe
some who might admit the competency of our government to these beneficent duties might doubt it in trials which put to the test its strength and efficiency as a member of the great community of nations,1817-Monroe
here too experience has afforded us the most satisfactory proof in its favor,1817-Monroe
just as this constitution was put into action several of the principal states of europe had become much agitated and some of them seriously convulsed,1817-Monroe
destructive wars ensued which have of late only been terminated,1817-Monroe
in the course of these conflicts the united states received great injury from several of the parties,1817-Monroe
it was their interest to stand aloof from the contest to demand justice from the party committing the injury and to cultivate by a fair and honorable conduct the friendship of all,1817-Monroe
war became at length inevitable and the result has shown that our government is equal to that the greatest of trials under the most unfavorable circumstances,1817-Monroe
of the virtue of the people and of the heroic exploits of the army the navy and the militia i need not speak,1817-Monroe
such then is the happy government under which we live a government adequate to every purpose for which the social compact is formed a government elective in all its branches under which every citizen may by his merit obtain the highest trust recognized by the constitution which contains within it no cause of discord none to put at variance one portion of the community with another a government which protects every citizen in the full enjoyment of his rights and is able to protect the nation against injustice from foreign powers,1817-Monroe
other considerations of the highest importance admonish us to cherish our union and to cling to the government which supports it,1817-Monroe
fortunate as we are in our political institutions we have not been less so in other circumstances on which our prosperity and happiness essentially depend,1817-Monroe
situated within the temperate zone and extending through many degrees of latitude along the atlantic the united states enjoy all the varieties of climate and every production incident to that portion of the globe,1817-Monroe
penetrating internally to the great lakes and beyond the sources of the great rivers which communicate through our whole interior no country was ever happier with respect to its domain,1817-Monroe
blessed too with a fertile soil our produce has always been very abundant leaving even in years the least favorable a surplus for the wants of our fellow men in other countries,1817-Monroe
such is our peculiar felicity that there is not a part of our union that is not particularly interested in preserving it,1817-Monroe
the great agricultural interest of the nation prospers under its protection,1817-Monroe
local interests are not less fostered by it,1817-Monroe
our fellow citizens of the north engaged in navigation find great encouragement in being made the favored carriers of the vast productions of the other portions of the united states while the inhabitants of these are amply recompensed in their turn by the nursery for seamen and naval force thus formed and reared up for the support of our common rights,1817-Monroe
our manufactures find a generous encouragement by the policy which patronizes domestic industry and the surplus of our produce a steady and profitable market by local wants in less favored parts at home,1817-Monroe
such then being the highly favored condition of our country it is the interest of every citizen to maintain it,1817-Monroe
what are the dangers which menace us,1817-Monroe
if any exist they ought to be ascertained and guarded against,1817-Monroe
in explaining my sentiments on this subject it may be asked what raised us to the present happy state,1817-Monroe
how did we accomplish the revolution,1817-Monroe
how remedy the defects of the first instrument of our union by infusing into the national government sufficient power for national purposes without impairing the just rights of the states or affecting those of individuals,1817-Monroe
how sustain and pass with glory through the late war,1817-Monroe
the government has been in the hands of the people,1817-Monroe
to the people therefore and to the faithful and able depositaries of their trust is the credit due,1817-Monroe
had the people of the united states been educated in different principles had they been less intelligent less independent or less virtuous can it be believed that we should have maintained the same steady and consistent career or been blessed with the same success,1817-Monroe
while then the constituent body retains its present sound and healthful state everything will be safe,1817-Monroe
they will choose competent and faithful representatives for every department,1817-Monroe
it is only when the people become ignorant and corrupt when they degenerate into a populace that they are incapable of exercising the sovereignty,1817-Monroe
usurpation is then an easy attainment and an usurper soon found,1817-Monroe
the people themselves become the willing instruments of their own debasement and ruin,1817-Monroe
let us then look to the great cause and endeavor to preserve it in full force,1817-Monroe
let us by all wise and constitutional measures promote intelligence among the people as the best means of preserving our liberties,1817-Monroe
dangers from abroad are not less deserving of attention,1817-Monroe
experiencing the fortune of other nations the united states may be again involved in war and it may in that event be the object of the adverse party to overset our government to break our union and demolish us as a nation,1817-Monroe
our distance from europe and the just moderate and pacific policy of our government may form some security against these dangers but they ought to be anticipated and guarded against,1817-Monroe
many of our citizens are engaged in commerce and navigation and all of them are in a certain degree dependent on their prosperous state,1817-Monroe
many are engaged in the fisheries,1817-Monroe
these interests are exposed to invasion in the wars between other powers and we should disregard the faithful admonition of experience if we did not expect it,1817-Monroe
we must support our rights or lose our character and with it perhaps our liberties,1817-Monroe
a people who fail to do it can scarcely be said to hold a place among independent nations,1817-Monroe
national honor is national property of the highest value,1817-Monroe
the sentiment in the mind of every citizen is national strength,1817-Monroe
it ought therefore to be cherished,1817-Monroe
to secure us against these dangers our coast and inland frontiers should be fortified our army and navy regulated upon just principles as to the force of each be kept in perfect order and our militia be placed on the best practicable footing,1817-Monroe
to put our extensive coast in such a state of defense as to secure our cities and interior from invasion will be attended with expense but the work when finished will be permanent and it is fair to presume that a single campaign of invasion by a naval force superior to our own aided by a few thousand land troops would expose us to greater expense without taking into the estimate the loss of property and distress of our citizens than would be sufficient for this great work,1817-Monroe
our land and naval forces should be moderate but adequate to the necessary purposes the former to garrison and preserve our fortifications and to meet the first invasions of foreign foe and while constituting the elements of a greater force to preserve the science as well as all the necessary implements of war in a state to be brought into activity in the event of war the latter retained within the limits proper in a state of peace might aid in maintaining the neutrality of the united states with dignity in the wars of other powers and in saving the property of their citizens from spoliation,1817-Monroe
in time of war with the enlargement of which the great naval resources of the country render it susceptible and which should be duly fostered in time,1817-Monroe
of peace it would contribute essentially both as an auxiliary of defense and as a powerful engine of annoyance to diminish the calamities of war and to bring the war to a speedy and honorable termination,1817-Monroe
but it ought always to be held prominently in view that the safety of these states and of everything dear to a free people must depend in an eminent degree on the militia,1817-Monroe
invasions may be made too formidable to be resisted by any land and naval force which it would comport either with the principles of our government or the circumstances of the united states to maintain,1817-Monroe
in such cases recourse must be had to the great body of the people and in a manner to produce the best effect,1817-Monroe
it is of the highest importance therefore that they be so organized and trained as to be prepared for any emergency,1817-Monroe
the arrangement should be such as to put at the command of the government the ardent patriotism and youthful vigor of the country,1817-Monroe
if formed on equal and just principles it can not be oppressive,1817-Monroe
it is the crisis which makes the pressure and not the laws which provide a remedy for it,1817-Monroe
this arrangement should be formed too in time of peace to be the better prepared for war,1817-Monroe
with such an organization of such a people the united states have nothing to dread from foreign invasion,1817-Monroe
at its approach an overwhelming force of gallant men might always be put in motion,1817-Monroe
other interests of high importance will claim attention among which the improvement of our country by roads and canals proceeding always with a constitutional sanction holds a distinguished place,1817-Monroe
by thus facilitating the intercourse between the states we shall add much to the convenience and comfort of our fellow citizens much to the ornament of the country and what is of greater importance we shall shorten distances and by making each part more accessible to and dependent on the other we shall bind the union more closely together,1817-Monroe
nature has done so much for us by intersecting the country with so many great rivers bays and lakes approaching from distant points so near to each other that the inducement to complete the work seems to be peculiarly strong,1817-Monroe
a more interesting spectacle was perhaps never seen than is exhibited within the limits of the united states a territory so vast and advantageously situated containing objects so grand so useful so happily connected in all their parts,1817-Monroe
our manufacturers will likewise require the systematic and fostering care of the government,1817-Monroe
possessing as we do all the raw materials the fruit of our own soil and industry we ought not to depend in the degree we have done on supplies from other countries,1817-Monroe
while we are thus dependent the sudden event of war unsought and unexpected can not fail to plunge us into the most serious difficulties it is important too that the capital which nourishes our manufacturers should be domestic as its influence in that case instead of exhausting as it may do in foreign hands would be felt advantageously on agriculture and every other branch of industry equally important is it to provide at home a market for our raw materials as by extending the competition it will enhance the price and protect the cultivator against the casualties incident to foreign markets,1817-Monroe
with the indian tribes it is our duty to cultivate friendly relations and to act with kindness and liberality in all our transactions,1817-Monroe
equally proper is it to persevere in our efforts to extend to them the advantages of civilization,1817-Monroe
the great amount of our revenue and the flourishing state of the treasury are a full proof of the competency of the national resources for any emergency as they are of the willingness of our fellow citizens to bear the burdens which the public necessities require,1817-Monroe
the vast amount of vacant lands the value of which daily augments forms an additional resource of great extent and duration,1817-Monroe
these resources besides accomplishing every other necessary purpose put it completely in the power of the united states to discharge the national debt at an early period,1817-Monroe
peace is the best time for improvement and preparation of every kind it is in peace that our commerce flourishes most that taxes are most easily paid and that the revenue is most productive,1817-Monroe
the executive is charged officially in the departments under it with the disbursement of the public money and is responsible for the faithful application of it to the purposes for which it is raised,1817-Monroe
the legislature is the watchful guardian over the public purse,1817-Monroe
it is its duty to see that the disbursement has been honestly made,1817-Monroe
to meet the requisite responsibility every facility should be afforded to the executive to enable it to bring the public agents intrusted with the public money strictly and promptly to account,1817-Monroe
nothing should be presumed against them but if with the requisite facilities the public money is suffered to lie long and uselessly in their hands they will not be the only defaulters nor will the demoralizing effect be confined to them,1817-Monroe
it will evince a relaxation and want of tone in the administration which will be felt by the whole community,1817-Monroe
i shall do all i can to secure economy and fidelity in this important branch of the administration and i doubt not that the legislature will perform its duty with equal zeal,1817-Monroe
a thorough examination should be regularly made and i will promote it,1817-Monroe
it is particularly gratifying to me to enter on the discharge of these duties at a time when the united states are blessed with peace,1817-Monroe
it is a state most consistent with their prosperity and happiness,1817-Monroe
it will be my sincere desire to preserve it so far as depends on the executive on just principles with all nations claiming nothing unreasonable of any and rendering to each what is its due,1817-Monroe
equally gratifying is it to witness the increased harmony of opinion which pervades our union,1817-Monroe
discord does not belong to our system,1817-Monroe
union is recommended as well by the free and benign principles of our government extending its blessings to every individual as by the other eminent advantages attending it,1817-Monroe
the american people have encountered together great dangers and sustained severe trials with success,1817-Monroe
they constitute one great family with a common interest,1817-Monroe
experience has enlightened us on some questions of essential importance to the country,1817-Monroe
the progress has been slow dictated by a just reflection and a faithful regard to every interest connected with it,1817-Monroe
to promote this harmony in accord with the principles of our republican government and in a manner to give them the most complete effect and to advance in all other respects the best interests of our union will be the object of my constant and zealous exertions,1817-Monroe
never did a government commence under auspices so favorable nor ever was success so complete,1817-Monroe
if we look to the history of other nations ancient or modern we find no example of a growth so rapid so gigantic of a people so prosperous and happy,1817-Monroe
in contemplating what we have still to perform the heart of every citizen must expand with joy when he reflects how near our government has approached to perfection that in respect to it we have no essential improvement to make that the great object is to preserve it in the essential principles and features which characterize it and that is to be done by preserving the virtue and enlightening the minds of the people and as a security against foreign dangers to adopt such arrangements as are indispensable to the support of our independence our rights and liberties,1817-Monroe
if we persevere in the career in which we have advanced so far and in the path already traced we can not fail under the favor of a gracious providence to attain the high destiny which seems to await us,1817-Monroe
in the administrations of the illustrious men who have preceded me in this high station with some of whom i have been connected by the closest ties from early life examples are presented which will always be found highly instructive and useful to their successors,1817-Monroe
from these i shall endeavor to derive all the advantages which they may afford,1817-Monroe
of my immediate predecessor under whom so important a portion of this great and successful experiment has been made i shall be pardoned for expressing my earnest wishes that he may long enjoy in his retirement the affections of a grateful country the best reward of exalted talents and the most faithful and meritorious service,1817-Monroe
relying on the aid to be derived from the other departments of the government i enter on the trust to which i have been called by the suffrages of my fellow citizens with my fervent prayers to the almighty that he will be graciously pleased to continue to us that protection which he has already so conspicuously displayed in our favor,1817-Monroe
fellow citizens i shall not attempt to describe the grateful emotions which the new and very distinguished proof of the confidence of my fellow citizens evinced by my reelection to this high trust has excited in my bosom,1821-Monroe
the approbation which it announces of my conduct in the preceding term affords me a consolation which i shall profoundly feel through life,1821-Monroe
the general accord with which it has been expressed adds to the great and never ceasing obligations which it imposes,1821-Monroe
to merit the continuance of this good opinion and to carry it with me into my retirement as the solace of advancing years will be the object of my most zealous and unceasing efforts,1821-Monroe
having no pretensions to the high and commanding claims of my predecessors whose names are so much more conspicuously identified with our revolution and who contributed so preeminently to promote its success i consider myself rather as the instrument than the cause of the union which has prevailed in the late election in surmounting in favor of my humble pretensions the difficulties which so often produce division in like occurrences it is obvious that other powerful causes indicating the great strength and stability of our union have essentially contributed to draw you together,1821-Monroe
that these powerful causes exist and that they are permanent is my fixed opinion that they may produce a like accord in all questions touching however remotely the liberty prosperity and happiness of our country will always be the object of my most fervent prayers to the supreme author of all good,1821-Monroe
in a government which is founded by the people who possess exclusively the sovereignty it seems proper that the person who may be placed by their suffrages in this high trust should declare on commencing its duties the principles on which he intends to conduct the administration,1821-Monroe
if the person thus elected has served the preceding term an opportunity is afforded him to review its principal occurrences and to give such further explanation respecting them as in his judgment may be useful to his constituents,1821-Monroe
the events of one year have influence on those of another and in like manner of a preceding on the succeeding administration,1821-Monroe
the movements of a great nation are connected in all their parts,1821-Monroe
if errors have been committed they ought to be corrected if the policy is sound it ought to be supported,1821-Monroe
it is by a thorough knowledge of the whole subject that our fellow citizens are enabled to judge correctly of the past and to give a proper direction to the future,1821-Monroe
just before the commencement of the last term the united states had concluded a war with a very powerful nation on conditions equal and honorable to both parties,1821-Monroe
the events of that war are too recent and too deeply impressed on the memory of all to require a development from me,1821-Monroe
our commerce had been in a great measure driven from the sea our atlantic and inland frontiers were invaded in almost every part the waste of life along our coast and on some parts of our inland frontiers to the defense of which our gallant and patriotic citizens were called was immense in addition to which not less than 120 000 000 were added at its end to the public debt,1821-Monroe
as soon as the war had terminated the nation admonished by its events resolved to place itself in a situation which should be better calculated to prevent the recurrence of a like evil and in case it should recur to mitigate its calamities,1821-Monroe
with this view after reducing our land force to the basis of a peace establishment which has been further modified since provision was made for the construction of fortifications at proper points through the whole extent of our coast and such an augmentation of our naval force as should be well adapted to both purposes,1821-Monroe
the laws making this provision were passed in 1815 and 1816 and it has been since the constant effort of the executive to carry them into effect,1821-Monroe
the advantage of these fortifications and of an augmented naval force in the extent contemplated in a point of economy has been fully illustrated by a report of the board of engineers and naval commissioners lately communicated to congress by which it appears that in an invasion by 20 000 men with a correspondent naval force in a campaign of six months only the whole expense of the construction of the works would be defrayed by the difference in the sum necessary to maintain the force which would be adequate to our defense with the aid of those works and that which would be incurred without them,1821-Monroe
the reason of this difference is obvious,1821-Monroe
if fortifications are judiciously placed on our great inlets as distant from our cities as circumstances will permit they will form the only points of attack and the enemy will be detained there by a small regular force a sufficient time to enable our militia to collect and repair to that on which the attack is made,1821-Monroe
a force adequate to the enemy collected at that single point with suitable preparation for such others as might be menaced is all that would be requisite,1821-Monroe
but if there were no fortifications then the enemy might go where he pleased and changing his position and sailing from place to place our force must be called out and spread in vast numbers along the whole coast and on both sides of every bay and river as high up in each as it might be navigable for ships of war,1821-Monroe
by these fortifications supported by our navy to which they would afford like support we should present to other powers an armed front from st croix to the sabine which would protect in the event of war our whole coast and interior from invasion and even in the wars of other powers in which we were neutral they would be found eminently useful as by keeping their public ships at a distance from our cities peace and order in them would be preserved and the government be protected from insult,1821-Monroe
it need scarcely be remarked that these measures have not been resorted to in a spirit of hostility to other powers,1821-Monroe
such a disposition does not exist toward any power,1821-Monroe
peace and good will have been and will hereafter be cultivated with all and by the most faithful regard to justice,1821-Monroe
they have been dictated by a love of peace of economy and an earnest desire to save the lives of our fellow citizens from that destruction and our country from that devastation which are inseparable from war when it finds us unprepared for it,1821-Monroe
it is believed and experience has shown that such a preparation is the best expedient that can be resorted to prevent war,1821-Monroe
i add with much pleasure that considerable progress has already been made in these measures of defense and that they will be completed in a few years considering the great extent and importance of the object if the plan be zealously and steadily persevered in,1821-Monroe
the conduct of the government in what relates to foreign powers is always an object of the highest importance to the nation,1821-Monroe
its agriculture commerce manufactures fisheries revenue in short its peace may all be affected by it,1821-Monroe
attention is therefore due to this subject,1821-Monroe
at the period adverted to the powers of europe after having been engaged in long and destructive wars with each other had concluded a peace which happily still exists,1821-Monroe
our peace with the power with whom we had been engaged had also been concluded,1821-Monroe
the war between spain and the colonies in south america which had commenced many years before was then the only conflict that remained unsettled,1821-Monroe
this being a contest between different parts of the same community in which other powers had not interfered was not affected by their accommodations,1821-Monroe
this contest was considered at an early stage by my predecessor a civil war in which the parties were entitled to equal rights in our ports,1821-Monroe
this decision the first made by any power being formed on great consideration of the comparative strength and resources of the parties the length of time and successful opposition made by the colonies and of all other circumstances on which it ought to depend was in strict accord with the law of nations,1821-Monroe
congress has invariably acted on this principle having made no change in our relations with either party,1821-Monroe
our attitude has therefore been that of neutrality between them which has been maintained by the government with the strictest impartiality,1821-Monroe
no aid has been afforded to either nor has any privilege been enjoyed by the one which has not been equally open to the other party and every exertion has been made in its power to enforce the execution of the laws prohibiting illegal equipments with equal rigor against both,1821-Monroe
by this equality between the parties their public vessels have been received in our ports on the same footing they have enjoyed an equal right to purchase and export arms munitions of war and every other supply the exportation of all articles whatever being permitted under laws which were passed long before the commencement of the contest our citizens have traded equally with both and their commerce with each has been alike protected by the government,1821-Monroe
respecting the attitude which it may be proper for the united states to maintain hereafter between the parties i have no hesitation in stating it as my opinion that the neutrality heretofore observed should still be adhered to,1821-Monroe
from the change in the government of spain and the negotiation now depending invited by the cortes and accepted by the colonies it may be presumed that their differences will be settled on the terms proposed by the colonies,1821-Monroe
should the war be continued the united states regarding its occurrences will always have it in their power to adopt such measures respecting it as their honor and interest may require,1821-Monroe
shortly after the general peace a band of adventurers took advantage of this conflict and of the facility which it afforded to establish a system of buccaneering in the neighboring seas to the great annoyance of the commerce of the united states and as was represented of that of other powers,1821-Monroe
of this spirit and of its injurious bearing on the united states strong proofs were afforded by the establishment at amelia island and the purposes to which it was made instrumental by this band in 1817 and by the occurrences which took place in other parts of florida in 1818 the details of which in both instances are too well known to require to be now recited,1821-Monroe
i am satisfied had a less decisive course been adopted that the worst consequences would have resulted from it,1821-Monroe
we have seen that these checks decisive as they were were not sufficient to crush that piratical spirit,1821-Monroe
many culprits brought within our limits have been condemned to suffer death the punishment due to that atrocious crime,1821-Monroe
the decisions of upright and enlightened tribunals fall equally on all whose crimes subject them by a fair interpretation of the law to its censure,1821-Monroe
it belongs to the executive not to suffer the executions under these decisions to transcend the great purpose for which punishment is necessary,1821-Monroe
the full benefit of example being secured policy as well as humanity equally forbids that they should be carried further,1821-Monroe
i have acted on this principle pardoning those who appear to have been led astray by ignorance of the criminality of the acts they had committed and suffering the law to take effect on those only in whose favor no extenuating circumstances could be urged,1821-Monroe
great confidence is entertained that the late treaty with spain which has been ratified by both the parties and the ratifications whereof have been exchanged has placed the relations of the two countries on a basis of permanent friendship,1821-Monroe
the provision made by it for such of our citizens as have claims on spain of the character described will it is presumed be very satisfactory to them and the boundary which is established between the territories of the parties westward of the mississippi heretofore in dispute has it is thought been settled on conditions just and advantageous to both,1821-Monroe
but to the acquisition of florida too much importance can not be attached,1821-Monroe
it secures to the united states a territory important in itself and whose importance is much increased by its bearing on many of the highest interests of the union,1821-Monroe
it opens to several of the neighboring states a free passage to the ocean through the province ceded by several rivers having their sources high up within their limits,1821-Monroe
it secures us against all future annoyance from powerful indian tribes,1821-Monroe
it gives us several excellent harbors in the gulf of mexico for ships of war of the largest size,1821-Monroe
it covers by its position in the gulf the mississippi and other great waters within our extended limits and thereby enables the united states to afford complete protection to the vast and very valuable productions of our whole western country which find a market through those streams,1821-Monroe
by a treaty with the british government bearing date on the 20th of october 1818 the convention regulating the commerce between the united states and great britain concluded on the 3d of july 1815 which was about expiring was revived and continued for the term of ten years from the time of its expiration,1821-Monroe
by that treaty also the differences which had arisen under the treaty of ghent respecting the right claimed by the united states for their citizens to take and cure fish on the coast of his britannic majesty s dominions in america with other differences on important interests were adjusted to the satisfaction of both parties,1821-Monroe
no agreement has yet been entered into respecting the commerce between the united states and the british dominions in the west indies and on this continent,1821-Monroe
the restraints imposed on that commerce by great britain and reciprocated by the united states on a principle of defense continue still in force,1821-Monroe
the negotiation with france for the regulation of the commercial relations between the two countries which in the course of the last summer had been commenced at paris has since been transferred to this city and will be pursued on the part of the united states in the spirit of conciliation and with an earnest desire that it may terminate in an arrangement satisfactory to both parties,1821-Monroe
our relations with the barbary powers are preserved in the same state and by the same means that were employed when i came into this office,1821-Monroe
as early as 1801 it was found necessary to send a squadron into the mediterranean for the protection of our commerce and no period has intervened a short term excepted when it was thought advisable to withdraw it,1821-Monroe
the great interests which the united states have in the pacific in commerce and in the fisheries have also made it necessary to maintain a naval force there in disposing of this force in both instances the most effectual measures in our power have been taken without interfering with its other duties for the suppression of the slave trade and of piracy in the neighboring seas,1821-Monroe
the situation of the united states in regard to their resources the extent of their revenue and the facility with which it is raised affords a most gratifying spectacle,1821-Monroe
the payment of nearly 67 000 000 of the public debt with the great progress made in measures of defense and in other improvements of various kinds since the late war are conclusive proofs of this extraordinary prosperity especially when it is recollected that these expenditures have been defrayed without a burthen on the people the direct tax and excise having been repealed soon after the conclusion of the late war and the revenue applied to these great objects having been raised in a manner not to be felt,1821-Monroe
our great resources therefore remain untouched for any purpose which may affect the vital interests of the nation,1821-Monroe
for all such purposes they are inexhaustible,1821-Monroe
they are more especially to be found in the virtue patriotism and intelligence of our fellow citizens and in the devotion with which they would yield up by any just measure of taxation all their property in support of the rights and honor of their country,1821-Monroe
under the present depression of prices affecting all the productions of the country and every branch of industry proceeding from causes explained on a former occasion the revenue has considerably diminished the effect of which has been to compel congress either to abandon these great measures of defense or to resort to loans or internal taxes to supply the deficiency,1821-Monroe
on the presumption that this depression and the deficiency in the revenue arising from it would be temporary loans were authorized for the demands of the last and present year,1821-Monroe
anxious to relieve my fellow citizens in 1817 from every burthen which could be dispensed with and the state of the treasury permitting it i recommended the repeal of the internal taxes knowing that such relief was then peculiarly necessary in consequence of the great exertions made in the late war,1821-Monroe
i made that recommendation under a pledge that should the public exigencies require a recurrence to them at any time while i remained in this trust i would with equal promptitude perform the duty which would then be alike incumbent on me,1821-Monroe
by the experiment now making it will be seen by the next session of congress whether the revenue shall have been so augmented as to be adequate to all these necessary purposes,1821-Monroe
should the deficiency still continue and especially should it be probable that it would be permanent the course to be pursued appears to me to be obvious,1821-Monroe
i am satisfied that under certain circumstances loans may be resorted to with great advantage,1821-Monroe
i am equally well satisfied as a general rule that the demands of the current year especially in time of peace should be provided for by the revenue of that year,1821-Monroe
i have never dreaded nor have i ever shunned in any situation in which i have been placed making appeals to the virtue and patriotism of my fellow citizens well knowing that they could never be made in vain especially in times of great emergency or for purposes of high national importance,1821-Monroe
independently of the exigency of the case many considerations of great weight urge a policy having in view a provision of revenue to meet to a certain extent the demands of the nation without relying altogether on the precarious resource of foreign commerce,1821-Monroe
i am satisfied that internal duties and excises with corresponding imposts on foreign articles of the same kind would without imposing any serious burdens on the people enhance the price of produce promote our manufactures and augment the revenue at the same time that they made it more secure and permanent,1821-Monroe
the care of the indian tribes within our limits has long been an essential part of our system but unfortunately it has not been executed in a manner to accomplish all the objects intended by it,1821-Monroe
we have treated them as independent nations without their having any substantial pretensions to that rank,1821-Monroe
the distinction has flattered their pride retarded their improvement and in many instances paved the way to their destruction,1821-Monroe
the progress of our settlements westward supported as they are by a dense population has constantly driven them back with almost the total sacrifice of the lands which they have been compelled to abandon,1821-Monroe
they have claims on the magnanimity and i may add on the justice of this nation which we must all feel,1821-Monroe
we should become their real benefactors we should perform the office of their great father the endearing title which they emphatically give to the chief magistrate of our union,1821-Monroe
their sovereignty over vast territories should cease in lieu of which the right of soil should be secured to each individual and his posterity in competent portions and for the territory thus ceded by each tribe some reasonable equivalent should be granted to be vested in permanent funds for the support of civil government over them and for the education of their children for their instruction in the arts of husbandry and to provide sustenance for them until they could provide it for themselves,1821-Monroe
my earnest hope is that congress will digest some plan founded on these principles with such improvements as their wisdom may suggest and carry it into effect as soon as it may be practicable,1821-Monroe
europe is again unsettled and the prospect of war increasing,1821-Monroe
should the flame light up in any quarter how far it may extend it is impossible to foresee,1821-Monroe
it is our peculiar felicity to be altogether unconnected with the causes which produce this menacing aspect elsewhere,1821-Monroe
with every power we are in perfect amity and it is our interest to remain so if it be practicable on just conditions,1821-Monroe
i see no reasonable cause to apprehend variance with any power unless it proceed from a violation of our maritime rights,1821-Monroe
in these contests should they occur and to whatever extent they may be carried we shall be neutral but as a neutral power we have rights which it is our duty to maintain,1821-Monroe
for like injuries it will be incumbent on us to seek redress in a spirit of amity in full confidence that injuring none none would knowingly injure us,1821-Monroe
for more imminent dangers we should be prepared and it should always be recollected that such preparation adapted to the circumstances and sanctioned by the judgment and wishes of our constituents can not fail to have a good effect in averting dangers of every kind,1821-Monroe
we should recollect also that the season of peace is best adapted to these preparations,1821-Monroe
if we turn our attention fellow citizens more immediately to the internal concerns of our country and more especially to those on which its future welfare depends we have every reason to anticipate the happiest results,1821-Monroe
it is now rather more than forty four years since we declared our independence and thirty seven since it was acknowledged,1821-Monroe
the talents and virtues which were displayed in that great struggle were a sure presage of all that has since followed,1821-Monroe
a people who were able to surmount in their infant state such great perils would be more competent as they rose into manhood to repel any which they might meet in their progress,1821-Monroe
their physical strength would be more adequate to foreign danger and the practice of self government aided by the light of experience could not fail to produce an effect equally salutary on all those questions connected with the internal organization,1821-Monroe
these favorable anticipations have been realized,1821-Monroe
in our whole system national and state we have shunned all the defects which unceasingly preyed on the vitals and destroyed the ancient republics,1821-Monroe
in them there were distinct orders a nobility and a people or the people governed in one assembly,1821-Monroe
thus in the one instance there was a perpetual conflict between the orders in society for the ascendency in which the victory of either terminated in the overthrow of the government and the ruin of the state in the other in which the people governed in a body and whose dominions seldom exceeded the dimensions of a county in one of our states a tumultuous and disorderly movement permitted only a transitory existence,1821-Monroe
in this great nation there is but one order that of the people whose power by a peculiarly happy improvement of the representative principle is transferred from them without impairing in the slightest degree their sovereignty to bodies of their own creation and to persons elected by themselves in the full extent necessary for all the purposes of free enlightened and efficient government,1821-Monroe
the whole system is elective the complete sovereignty being in the people and every officer in every department deriving his authority from and being responsible to them for his conduct,1821-Monroe
our career has corresponded with this great outline,1821-Monroe
perfection in our organization could not have been expected in the outset either in the national or state governments or in tracing the line between their respective powers,1821-Monroe
but no serious conflict has arisen nor any contest but such as are managed by argument and by a fair appeal to the good sense of the people and many of the defects which experience had clearly demonstrated in both governments have been remedied,1821-Monroe
by steadily pursuing this course in this spirit there is every reason to believe that our system will soon attain the highest degree of perfection of which human institutions are capable and that the movement in all its branches will exhibit such a degree of order and harmony as to command the admiration and respect of the civilized world,1821-Monroe
our physical attainments have not been less eminent,1821-Monroe
twenty five years ago the river mississippi was shut up and our western brethren had no outlet for their commerce,1821-Monroe
what has been the progress since that time,1821-Monroe
the river has not only become the property of the united states from its source to the ocean with all its tributary streams with the exception of the upper part of the red river only but louisiana with a fair and liberal boundary on the western side and the floridas on the eastern have been ceded to us,1821-Monroe
the united states now enjoy the complete and uninterrupted sovereignty over the whole territory from st croix to the sabine,1821-Monroe
new states settled from among ourselves in this and in other parts have been admitted into our union in equal participation in the national sovereignty with the original states,1821-Monroe
our population has augmented in an astonishing degree and extended in every direction,1821-Monroe
we now fellow citizens comprise within our limits the dimensions and faculties of a great power under a government possessing all the energies of any government ever known to the old world with an utter incapacity to oppress the people,1821-Monroe
entering with these views the office which i have just solemnly sworn to execute with fidelity and to the utmost of my ability i derive great satisfaction from a knowledge that i shall be assisted in the several departments by the very enlightened and upright citizens from whom i have received so much aid in the preceding term,1821-Monroe
with full confidence in the continuance of that candor and generous indulgence from my fellow citizens at large which i have heretofore experienced and with a firm reliance on the protection of almighty god i shall forthwith commence the duties of the high trust to which you have called me,1821-Monroe
in compliance with an usage coeval with the existence of our federal constitution and sanctioned by the example of my predecessors in the career upon which i am about to enter i appear my fellow citizens in your presence and in that of heaven to bind myself by the solemnities of religious obligation to the faithful performance of the duties allotted to me in the station to which i have been called,1825-Adams
in unfolding to my countrymen the principles by which i shall be governed in the fulfillment of those duties my first resort will be to that constitution which i shall swear to the best of my ability to preserve protect and defend,1825-Adams
that revered instrument enumerates the powers and prescribes the duties of the executive magistrate and in its first words declares the purposes to which these and the whole action of the government instituted by it should be invariably and sacredly devoted to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to the people of this union in their successive generations,1825-Adams
since the adoption of this social compact one of these generations has passed away,1825-Adams
it is the work of our forefathers,1825-Adams
administered by some of the most eminent men who contributed to its formation through a most eventful period in the annals of the world and through all the vicissitudes of peace and war incidental to the condition of associated man it has not disappointed the hopes and aspirations of those illustrious benefactors of their age and nation,1825-Adams
it has promoted the lasting welfare of that country so dear to us all it has to an extent far beyond the ordinary lot of humanity secured the freedom and happiness of this people,1825-Adams
we now receive it as a precious inheritance from those to whom we are indebted for its establishment doubly bound by the examples which they have left us and by the blessings which we have enjoyed as the fruits of their labors to transmit the same unimpaired to the succeeding generation,1825-Adams
in the compass of thirty six years since this great national covenant was instituted a body of laws enacted under its authority and in conformity with its provisions has unfolded its powers and carried into practical operation its effective energies,1825-Adams
subordinate departments have distributed the executive functions in their various relations to foreign affairs to the revenue and expenditures and to the military force of the union by land and sea,1825-Adams
a coordinate department of the judiciary has expounded the constitution and the laws settling in harmonious coincidence with the legislative will numerous weighty questions of construction which the imperfection of human language had rendered unavoidable,1825-Adams
the year of jubilee since the first formation of our union has just elapsed that of the declaration of our independence is at hand,1825-Adams
the consummation of both was effected by this constitution,1825-Adams
since that period a population of four millions has multiplied to twelve,1825-Adams
a territory bounded by the mississippi has been extended from sea to sea,1825-Adams
new states have been admitted to the union in numbers nearly equal to those of the first confederation,1825-Adams
treaties of peace amity and commerce have been concluded with the principal dominions of the earth,1825-Adams
the people of other nations inhabitants of regions acquired not by conquest but by compact have been united with us in the participation of our rights and duties of our burdens and blessings,1825-Adams
the forest has fallen by the ax of our woodsmen the soil has been made to teem by the tillage of our farmers our commerce has whitened every ocean,1825-Adams
the dominion of man over physical nature has been extended by the invention of our artists,1825-Adams
liberty and law have marched hand in hand,1825-Adams
all the purposes of human association have been accomplished as effectively as under any other government on the globe and at a cost little exceeding in a whole generation the expenditure of other nations in a single year,1825-Adams
such is the unexaggerated picture of our condition under a constitution founded upon the republican principle of equal rights,1825-Adams
to admit that this picture has its shades is but to say that it is still the condition of men upon earth,1825-Adams
from evil physical moral and political it is not our claim to be exempt,1825-Adams
we have suffered sometimes by the visitation of heaven through disease often by the wrongs and injustice of other nations even to the extremities of war and lastly by dissensions among ourselves dissensions perhaps inseparable from the enjoyment of freedom but which have more than once appeared to threaten the dissolution of the union and with it the overthrow of all the enjoyments of our present lot and all our earthly hopes of the future,1825-Adams
the causes of these dissensions have been various founded upon differences of speculation in the theory of republican government upon conflicting views of policy in our relations with foreign nations upon jealousies of partial and sectional interests aggravated by prejudices and prepossessions which strangers to each other are ever apt to entertain,1825-Adams
it is a source of gratification and of encouragement to me to observe that the great result of this experiment upon the theory of human rights has at the close of that generation by which it was formed been crowned with success equal to the most sanguine expectations of its founders,1825-Adams
union justice tranquillity the common defense the general welfare and the blessings of liberty all have been promoted by the government under which we have lived,1825-Adams
standing at this point of time looking back to that generation which has gone by and forward to that which is advancing we may at once indulge in grateful exultation and in cheering hope,1825-Adams
from the experience of the past we derive instructive lessons for the future,1825-Adams
of the two great political parties which have divided the opinions and feelings of our country the candid and the just will now admit that both have contributed splendid talents spotless integrity ardent patriotism and disinterested sacrifices to the formation and administration of this government and that both have required a liberal indulgence for a portion of human infirmity and error,1825-Adams
the revolutionary wars of europe commencing precisely at the moment when the government of the united states first went into operation under this constitution excited a collision of sentiments and of sympathies which kindled all the passions and imbittered the conflict of parties till the nation was involved in war and the union was shaken to its center,1825-Adams
this time of trial embraced a period of five and twenty years during which the policy of the union in its relations with europe constituted the principal basis of our political divisions and the most arduous part of the action of our federal government,1825-Adams
with the catastrophe in which the wars of the french revolution terminated and our own subsequent peace with great britain this baneful weed of party strife was uprooted,1825-Adams
from that time no difference of principle connected either with the theory of government or with our intercourse with foreign nations has existed or been called forth in force sufficient to sustain a continued combination of parties or to give more than wholesome animation to public sentiment or legislative debate,1825-Adams
our political creed is without a dissenting voice that can be heard that the will of the people is the source and the happiness of the people the end of all legitimate government upon earth that the best security for the beneficence and the best guaranty against the abuse of power consists in the freedom the purity and the frequency of popular elections that the general government of the union and the separate governments of the states are all sovereignties of limited powers fellow servants of the same masters uncontrolled within their respective spheres uncontrollable by encroachments upon each other that the firmest security of peace is the preparation during peace of the defenses of war that a rigorous economy and accountability of public expenditures should guard against the aggravation and alleviate when possible the burden of taxation that the military should be kept in strict subordination to the civil power that the freedom of the press and of religious opinion should be inviolate that the policy of our country is peace and the ark of our salvation union are articles of faith upon which we are all now agreed,1825-Adams
if there have been those who doubted whether a confederated representative democracy were a government competent to the wise and orderly management of the common concerns of a mighty nation those doubts have been dispelled if there have been projects of partial confederacies to be erected upon the ruins of the union they have been scattered to the winds if there have been dangerous attachments to one foreign nation and antipathies against another they have been extinguished,1825-Adams
ten years of peace at home and abroad have assuaged the animosities of political contention and blended into harmony the most discordant elements of public opinion there still remains one effort of magnanimity one sacrifice of prejudice and passion to be made by the individuals throughout the nation who have heretofore followed the standards of political party,1825-Adams
it is that of discarding every remnant of rancor against each other of embracing as countrymen and friends and of yielding to talents and virtue alone that confidence which in times of contention for principle was bestowed only upon those who bore the badge of party communion,1825-Adams
the collisions of party spirit which originate in speculative opinions or in different views of administrative policy are in their nature transitory,1825-Adams
those which are founded on geographical divisions adverse interests of soil climate and modes of domestic life are more permanent and therefore perhaps more dangerous,1825-Adams
it is this which gives inestimable value to the character of our government at once federal and national,1825-Adams
it holds out to us a perpetual admonition to preserve alike and with equal anxiety the rights of each individual state in its own government and the rights of the whole nation in that of the union,1825-Adams
whatsoever is of domestic concernment unconnected with the other members of the union or with foreign lands belongs exclusively to the administration of the state governments,1825-Adams
whatsoever directly involves the rights and interests of the federative fraternity or of foreign powers is of the resort of this general government,1825-Adams
the duties of both are obvious in the general principle though sometimes perplexed with difficulties in the detail,1825-Adams
to respect the rights of the state governments is the inviolable duty of that of the union the government of every state will feel its own obligation to respect and preserve the rights of the whole,1825-Adams
the prejudices everywhere too commonly entertained against distant strangers are worn away and the jealousies of jarring interests are allayed by the composition and functions of the great national councils annually assembled from all quarters of the union at this place,1825-Adams
here the distinguished men from every section of our country while meeting to deliberate upon the great interests of those by whom they are deputed learn to estimate the talents and do justice to the virtues of each other,1825-Adams
the harmony of the nation is promoted and the whole union is knit together by the sentiments of mutual respect the habits of social intercourse and the ties of personal friendship formed between the representatives of its several parts in the performance of their service at this metropolis,1825-Adams
passing from this general review of the purposes and injunctions of the federal constitution and their results as indicating the first traces of the path of duty in the discharge of my public trust i turn to the administration of my immediate predecessor as the second,1825-Adams
it has passed away in a period of profound peace how much to the satisfaction of our country and to the honor of our country s name is known to you all,1825-Adams
the great features of its policy in general concurrence with the will of the legislature have been to cherish peace while preparing for defensive war to yield exact justice to other nations and maintain the rights of our own to cherish the principles of freedom and of equal rights wherever they were proclaimed to discharge with all possible promptitude the national debt to reduce within the narrowest limits of efficiency the military force to improve the organization and discipline of the army to provide and sustain a school of military science to extend equal protection to all the great interests of the nation to promote the civilization of the indian tribes and to proceed in the great system of internal improvements within the limits of the constitutional power of the union,1825-Adams
under the pledge of these promises made by that eminent citizen at the time of his first induction to this office in his career of eight years the internal taxes have been repealed sixty millions of the public debt have been discharged provision has been made for the comfort and relief of the aged and indigent among the surviving warriors of the revolution the regular armed force has been reduced and its constitution revised and perfected the accountability for the expenditure of public moneys has bee made more effective the floridas have been peaceably acquired and our boundary has been extended to the pacific ocean the independence of the southern nations of this hemisphere has been recognized and recommended by example and by counsel to the potentates of europe progress has been made in the defense of the country by fortifications and the increase of the navy toward the effectual suppression of the african traffic in slaves in alluring the aboriginal hunters of our land to the cultivation of the soil and of the mind in exploring the interior regions of the union and in preparing by scientific researches and surveys for the further application of our national resources to the internal improvement of our country,1825-Adams
in this brief outline of the promise and performance of my immediate predecessor the line of duty for his successor is clearly delineated to pursue to their consummation those purposes of improvement in our common condition instituted or recommended by him will embrace the whole sphere of my obligations,1825-Adams
to the topic of internal improvement emphatically urged by him at his inauguration i recur with peculiar satisfaction,1825-Adams
it is that from which i am convinced that the unborn millions of our posterity who are in future ages to people this continent will derive their most fervent gratitude to the founders of the union that in which the beneficent action of its government will be most deeply felt and acknowledged,1825-Adams
the magnificence and splendor of their public works are among the imperishable glories of the ancient republics,1825-Adams
the roads and aqueducts of rome have been the admiration of all afte ages and have survived thousands of years after all her conquests have been swallowed up in despotism or become the spoil of barbarians,1825-Adams
some diversity of opinion has prevailed with regard to the powers of congress for legislation upon objects of this nature,1825-Adams
the most respectful deference is due to doubts originating in pure patriotism and sustained by venerated authority,1825-Adams
but nearly twenty years have passed since the construction of the first national road was commenced,1825-Adams
the authority for its construction was then unquestioned,1825-Adams
to how many thousands of our countrymen has it proved a benefit,1825-Adams
to what single individual has it ever proved an injury,1825-Adams
repeated liberal and candid discussions in the legislature have conciliated the sentiments and approximated the opinions of enlightened minds upon the question of constitutional power,1825-Adams
i can not but hope that by the same process of friendly patient and persevering deliberation all constitutional objections will ultimately be removed,1825-Adams
the extent and limitation of the powers of the general government in relation to this transcendently important interest will be settled and acknowledged to the common satisfaction of all and every speculative scruple will be solved by a practical public blessing,1825-Adams
fellow citizens you are acquainted with the peculiar circumstances of the recent election which have resulted in affording me the opportunity of addressing you at this time,1825-Adams
you have heard the exposition of the principles which will direct me in the fulfillment of the high and solemn trust imposed upon me in this station,1825-Adams
less possessed of your confidence in advance than any of my predecessors i am deeply conscious of the prospect that i shall stand more and oftener in need of your indulgence,1825-Adams
intentions upright and pure a heart devoted to the welfare of our country and the unceasing application of all the faculties allotted to me to her service are all the pledges that i can give for the faithful performance of the arduous duties i am to undertake,1825-Adams
to the guidance of the legislative councils to the assistance of the executive and subordinate departments to the friendly cooperation of the respective state governments to the candid and liberal support of the people so far as it may be deserved by honest industry and zeal i shall look for whatever success may attend my public service and knowing that except the lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain with fervent supplications for his favor to his overruling providence i commit with humble but fearless confidence my own fate and the future destinies of my country,1825-Adams
fellow citizens about to undertake the arduous duties that i have been appointed to perform by the choice of a free people i avail myself of this customary and solemn occasion to express the gratitude which their confidence inspires and to acknowledge the accountability which my situation enjoins,1829-Jackson
while the magnitude of their interests convinces me that no thanks can be adequate to the honor they have conferred it admonishes me that the best return i can make is the zealous dedication of my humble abilities to their service and their good,1829-Jackson
as the instrument of the federal constitution it will devolve on me for a stated period to execute the laws of the united states to superintend their foreign and their confederate relations to manage their revenue to command their forces and by communications to the legislature to watch over and to promote their interests generally,1829-Jackson
and the principles of action by which i shall endeavor to accomplish this circle of duties it is now proper for me briefly to explain,1829-Jackson
in administering the laws of congress i shall keep steadily in view the limitations as well as the extent of the executive power trusting thereby to discharge the functions of my office without transcending its authority,1829-Jackson
with foreign nations it will be my study to preserve peace and to cultivate friendship on fair and honorable terms and in the adjustment of any differences that may exist or arise to exhibit the forbearance becoming a powerful nation rather than the sensibility belonging to a gallant people,1829-Jackson
in such measures as i may be called on to pursue in regard to the rights of the separate states i hope to be animated by a proper respect for those sovereign members of our union taking care not to confound the powers they have reserved to themselves with those they have granted to the confederacy,1829-Jackson
the management of the public revenue that searching operation in all governments is among the most delicate and important trusts in ours and it will of course demand no inconsiderable share of my official solicitude,1829-Jackson
under every aspect in which it can be considered it would appear that advantage must result from the observance of a strict and faithful economy,1829-Jackson
this i shall aim at the more anxiously both because it will facilitate the extinguishment of the national debt the unnecessary duration of which is incompatible with real independence and because it will counteract that tendency to public and private profligacy which a profuse expenditure of money by the government is but too apt to engender,1829-Jackson
powerful auxiliaries to the attainment of this desirable end are to be found in the regulations provided by the wisdom of congress for the specific appropriation of public money and the prompt accountability of public officers,1829-Jackson
with regard to a proper selection of the subjects of impost with a view to revenue it would seem to me that the spirit of equity caution and compromise in which the constitution was formed requires that the great interests of agriculture commerce and manufactures should be equally favored and that perhaps the only exception to this rule should consist in the peculiar encouragement of any products of either of them that may be found essential to our national independence,1829-Jackson
internal improvement and the diffusion of knowledge so far as they can be promoted by the constitutional acts of the federal government are of high importance,1829-Jackson
considering standing armies as dangerous to free governments in time of peace i shall not seek to enlarge our present establishment nor disregard that salutary lesson of political experience which teaches that the military should be held subordinate to the civil power,1829-Jackson
the gradual increase of our navy whose flag has displayed in distant climes our skill in navigation and our fame in arms the preservation of our forts arsenals and dockyards and the introduction of progressive improvements in the discipline and science of both branches of our military service are so plainly prescribed by prudence that i should be excused for omitting their mention sooner than for enlarging on their importance,1829-Jackson
but the bulwark of our defense is the national militia which in the present state of our intelligence and population must render us invincible,1829-Jackson
as long as our government is administered for the good of the people and is regulated by their will as long as it secures to us the rights of person and of property liberty of conscience and of the press it will be worth defending and so long as it is worth defending a patriotic militia will cover it with an impenetrable aegis,1829-Jackson
partial injuries and occasional mortifications we may be subjected to but a million of armed freemen possessed of the means of war can never be conquered by a foreign foe,1829-Jackson
to any just system therefore calculated to strengthen this natural safeguard of the country i shall cheerfully lend all the aid in my power,1829-Jackson
it will be my sincere and constant desire to observe toward the indian tribes within our limits a just and liberal policy and to give that humane and considerate attention to their rights and their wants which is consistent with the habits of our government and the feelings of our people,1829-Jackson
the recent demonstration of public sentiment inscribes on the list of executive duties in characters too legible to be overlooked the task of reform which will require particularly the correction of those abuses that have brought the patronage of the federal government into conflict with the freedom of elections and the counteraction of those causes which have disturbed the rightful course of appointment and have placed or continued power in unfaithful or incompetent hands,1829-Jackson
in the performance of a task thus generally delineated i shall endeavor to select men whose diligence and talents will insure in their respective stations able and faithful cooperation depending for the advancement of the public service more on the integrity and zeal of the public officers than on their numbers,1829-Jackson
a diffidence perhaps too just in my own qualifications will teach me to look with reverence to the examples of public virtue left by my illustrious predecessors and with veneration to the lights that flow from the mind that founded and the mind that reformed our system,1829-Jackson
the same diffidence induces me to hope for instruction and aid from the coordinate branches of the government and for the indulgence and support of my fellow citizens generally,1829-Jackson
and a firm reliance on the goodness of that power whose providence mercifully protected our national infancy and has since upheld our liberties in various vicissitudes encourages me to offer up my ardent supplications that he will continue to make our beloved country the object of his divine care and gracious benediction,1829-Jackson
fellow citizens the will of the american people expressed through their unsolicited suffrages calls me before you to pass through the solemnities preparatory to taking upon myself the duties of president of the united states for another term,1833-Jackson
for their approbation of my public conduct through a period which has not been without its difficulties and for this renewed expression of their confidence in my good intentions i am at a loss for terms adequate to the expression of my gratitude,1833-Jackson
it shall be displayed to the extent of my humble abilities in continued efforts so to administer the government as to preserve their liberty and promote their happiness,1833-Jackson
so many events have occurred within the last four years which have necessarily called forth sometimes under circumstances the most delicate and painful my views of the principles and policy which ought to be pursued by the general government that i need on this occasion but allude to a few leading considerations connected with some of them,1833-Jackson
the foreign policy adopted by our government soon after the formation of our present constitution and very generally pursued by successive administrations has been crowned with almost complete success and has elevated our character among the nations of the earth,1833-Jackson
to do justice to all and to submit to wrong from none has been during my administration its governing maxim and so happy have been its results that we are not only at peace with all the world but have few causes of controversy and those of minor importance remaining unadjusted,1833-Jackson
in the domestic policy of this government there are two objects which especially deserve the attention of the people and their representatives and which have been and will continue to be the subjects of my increasing solicitude,1833-Jackson
they are the preservation of the rights of the several states and the integrity of the union,1833-Jackson
these great objects are necessarily connected and can only be attained by an enlightened exercise of the powers of each within its appropriate sphere in conformity with the public will constitutionally expressed,1833-Jackson
to this end it becomes the duty of all to yield a ready and patriotic submission to the laws constitutionally enacted and thereby promote and strengthen a proper confidence in those institutions of the several states and of the united states which the people themselves have ordained for their own government,1833-Jackson
my experience in public concerns and the observation of a life somewhat advanced confirm the opinions long since imbibed by me that the destruction of our state governments or the annihilation of their control over the local concerns of the people would lead directly to revolution and anarchy and finally to despotism and military domination,1833-Jackson
in proportion therefore as the general government encroaches upon the rights of the states in the same proportion does it impair its own power and detract from its ability to fulfill the purposes of its creation,1833-Jackson
solemnly impressed with these considerations my countrymen will ever find me ready to exercise my constitutional powers in arresting measures which may directly or indirectly encroach upon the rights of the states or tend to consolidate all political power in the general government,1833-Jackson
but of equal and indeed of incalculable importance is the union of these states and the sacred duty of all to contribute to its preservation by a liberal support of the general government in the exercise of its just powers,1833-Jackson
you have been wisely admonished to accustom yourselves to think and speak of the union as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of any attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts,1833-Jackson
without union our independence and liberty would never have been achieved without union they never can be maintained,1833-Jackson
divided into twenty four or even a smaller number of separate communities we shall see our internal trade burdened with numberless restraints and exactions communication between distant points and sections obstructed or cut off our sons made soldiers to deluge with blood the fields they now till in peace the mass of our people borne down and impoverished by taxes to support armies and navies and military leaders at the head of their victorious legions becoming our lawgivers and judges,1833-Jackson
the loss of liberty of all good government of peace plenty and happiness must inevitably follow a dissolution of the union,1833-Jackson
in supporting it therefore we support all that is dear to the freeman and the philanthropist,1833-Jackson
the time at which i stand before you is full of interest,1833-Jackson
the eyes of all nations are fixed on our republic,1833-Jackson
the event of the existing crisis will be decisive in the opinion of mankind of the practicability of our federal system of government,1833-Jackson
great is the stake placed in our hands great is the responsibility which must rest upon the people of the united states,1833-Jackson
let us realize the importance of the attitude in which we stand before the world,1833-Jackson
let us exercise forbearance and firmness,1833-Jackson
let us extricate our country from the dangers which surround it and learn wisdom from the lessons they inculcate,1833-Jackson
deeply impressed with the truth of these observations and under the obligation of that solemn oath which i am about to take i shall continue to exert all my faculties to maintain the just powers of the constitution and to transmit unimpaired to posterity the blessings of our federal union,1833-Jackson
at the same time it will be my aim to inculcate by my official acts the necessity of exercising by the general government those powers only that are clearly delegated to encourage simplicity and economy in the expenditures of the government to raise no more money from the people than may be requisite for these objects and in a manner that will best promote the interests of all classes of the community and of all portions of the union,1833-Jackson
constantly bearing in mind that in entering into society individuals must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest it will be my desire so to discharge my duties as to foster with our brethren in all parts of the country a spirit of liberal concession and compromise and by reconciling our fellow citizens to those partial sacrifices which they must unavoidably make for the preservation of a greater good to recommend our invaluable government and union to the confidence and affections of the american people,1833-Jackson
finally it is my most fervent prayer to that almighty being before whom i now stand and who has kept us in his hands from the infancy of our republic to the present day that he will so overrule all my intentions and actions and inspire the hearts of my fellow citizens that we may be preserved from dangers of all kinds and continue forever a united and happy people,1833-Jackson
fellow citizens the practice of all my predecessors imposes on me an obligation i cheerfully fulfill to accompany the first and solemn act of my public trust with an avowal of the principles that will guide me in performing it and an expression of my feelings on assuming a charge so responsible and vast,1837-VanBuren
in imitating their example i tread in the footsteps of illustrious men whose superiors it is our happiness to believe are not found on the executive calendar of any country,1837-VanBuren
among them we recognize the earliest and firmest pillars of the republic those by whom our national independence was first declared him who above all others contributed to establish it on the field of battle and those whose expanded intellect and patriotism constructed improved and perfected the inestimable institutions under which we live,1837-VanBuren
if such men in the position i now occupy felt themselves overwhelmed by a sense of gratitude for this the highest of all marks of their country s confidence and by a consciousness of their inability adequately to discharge the duties of an office so difficult and exalted how much more must these considerations affect one who can rely on no such claims for favor or forbearance,1837-VanBuren
unlike all who have preceded me the revolution that gave us existence as one people was achieved at the period of my birth and whilst i contemplate with grateful reverence that memorable event i feel that i belong to a later age and that i may not expect my countrymen to weigh my actions with the same kind and partial hand,1837-VanBuren
so sensibly fellow citizens do these circumstances press themselves upon me that i should not dare to enter upon my path of duty did i not look for the generous aid of those who will be associated with me in the various and coordinate branches of the government did i not repose with unwavering reliance on the patriotism the intelligence and the kindness of a people who never yet deserted a public servant honestly laboring their cause and above all did i not permit myself humbly to hope for the sustaining support of an ever watchful and beneficent providence,1837-VanBuren
to the confidence and consolation derived from these sources it would be ungrateful not to add those which spring from our present fortunate condition,1837-VanBuren
though not altogether exempt from embarrassments that disturb our tranquillity at home and threaten it abroad yet in all the attributes of a great happy and flourishing people we stand without a parallel in the world,1837-VanBuren
abroad we enjoy the respect and with scarcely an exception the friendship of every nation at home while our government quietly but efficiently performs the sole legitimate end of political institutions in doing the greatest good to the greatest number we present an aggregate of human prosperity surely not elsewhere to be found,1837-VanBuren
how imperious then is the obligation imposed upon every citizen in his own sphere of action whether limited or extended to exert himself in perpetuating a condition of things so singularly happy,1837-VanBuren
all the lessons of history and experience must be lost upon us if we are content to trust alone to the peculiar advantages we happen to possess,1837-VanBuren
position and climate and the bounteous resources that nature has scattered with so liberal a hand even the diffused intelligence and elevated character of our people will avail us nothing if we fail sacredly to uphold those political institutions that were wisely and deliberately formed with reference to every circumstance that could preserve or might endanger the blessings we enjoy,1837-VanBuren
the thoughtful framers of our constitution legislated for our country as they found it,1837-VanBuren
looking upon it with the eyes of statesmen and patriots they saw all the sources of rapid and wonderful prosperity but they saw also that various habits opinions and institutions peculiar to the various portions of so vast a region were deeply fixed,1837-VanBuren
distinct sovereignties were in actual existence whose cordial union was essential to the welfare and happiness of all,1837-VanBuren
between many of them there was at least to some extent a real diversity of interests liable to be exaggerated through sinister designs they differed in size in population in wealth and in actual and prospective resources and power they varied in the character of their industry and staple productions and in some existed domestic institutions which unwisely disturbed might endanger the harmony of the whole,1837-VanBuren
most carefully were all these circumstances weighed and the foundations of the new government laid upon principles of reciprocal concession and equitable compromise,1837-VanBuren
the jealousies which the smaller states might entertain of the power of the rest were allayed by a rule of representation confessedly unequal at the time and designed forever to remain so,1837-VanBuren
a natural fear that the broad scope of general legislation might bear upon and unwisely control particular interests was counteracted by limits strictly drawn around the action of the federal authority and to the people and the states was left unimpaired their sovereign power over the innumerable subjects embraced in the internal government of a just republic excepting such only as necessarily appertain to the concerns of the whole confederacy or its intercourse as a united community with the other nations of the world,1837-VanBuren
this provident forecast has been verified by time,1837-VanBuren
half a century teeming with extraordinary events and elsewhere producing astonishing results has passed along but on our institutions it has left no injurious mark,1837-VanBuren
from a small community we have risen to a people powerful in numbers and in strength but with our increase has gone hand in hand the progress of just principles,1837-VanBuren
the privileges civil and religious of the humblest individual are still sacredly protected at home and while the valor and fortitude of our people have removed far from us the slightest apprehension of foreign power they have not yet induced us in a single instance to forget what is right,1837-VanBuren
our commerce has been extended to the remotest nations the value and even nature of our productions have been greatly changed a wide difference has arisen in the relative wealth and resources of every portion of our country yet the spirit of mutual regard and of faithful adherence to existing compacts has continued to prevail in our councils and never long been absent from our conduct,1837-VanBuren
we have learned by experience a fruitful lesson that an implicit and undeviating adherence to the principles on which we set out can carry us prosperously onward through all the conflicts of circumstances and vicissitudes inseparable from the lapse of years,1837-VanBuren
the success that has thus attended our great experiment is in itself a sufficient cause for gratitude on account of the happiness it has actually conferred and the example it has unanswerably given but to me my fellow citizens looking forward to the far distant future with ardent prayers and confiding hopes this retrospect presents a ground for still deeper delight,1837-VanBuren
it impresses on my mind a firm belief that the perpetuity of our institutions depends upon ourselves that if we maintain the principles on which they were established they are destined to confer their benefits on countless generations yet to come and that america will present to every friend of mankind the cheering proof that a popular government wisely formed is wanting in no element of endurance or strength,1837-VanBuren
fifty years ago its rapid failure was boldly predicted,1837-VanBuren
latent and uncontrollable causes of dissolution were supposed to exist even by the wise and good and not only did unfriendly or speculative theorists anticipate for us the fate of past republics but the fears of many an honest patriot overbalanced his sanguine hopes,1837-VanBuren
look back on these forebodings not hastily but reluctantly made and see how in every instance they have completely failed,1837-VanBuren
an imperfect experience during the struggles of the revolution was supposed to warrant the belief that the people would not bear the taxation requisite to discharge an immense public debt already incurred and to pay the necessary expenses of the government the cost of two wars has been paid not only without a murmur but with unequaled alacrity,1837-VanBuren
no one is now left to doubt that every burden will be cheerfully borne that may be necessary to sustain our civil institutions or guard our honor or welfare,1837-VanBuren
indeed all experience has shown that the willingness of the people to contribute to these ends in cases of emergency has uniformly outrun the confidence of their representatives,1837-VanBuren
in the early stages of the new government when all felt the imposing influence as they recognized the unequaled services of the first president it was a common sentiment that the great weight of his character could alone bind the discordant materials of our government together and save us from the violence of contending factions,1837-VanBuren
since his death nearly forty years are gone,1837-VanBuren
party exasperation has been often carried to its highest point the virtue and fortitude of the people have sometimes been greatly tried yet our system purified and enhanced in value by all it has encountered still preserves its spirit of free and fearless discussion blended with unimpaired fraternal feeling,1837-VanBuren
the capacity of the people for self government and their willingness from a high sense of duty and without those exhibitions of coercive power so generally employed in other countries to submit to all needful restraints and exactions of municipal law have also been favorably exemplified in the history of the american states,1837-VanBuren
occasionally it is true the ardor of public sentiment outrunning the regular progress of the judicial tribunals or seeking to reach cases not denounced as criminal by the existing law has displayed itself in a manner calculated to give pain to the friends of free government and to encourage the hopes of those who wish for its overthrow,1837-VanBuren
these occurrences however have been far less frequent in our country than in any other of equal population on the globe and with the diffusion of intelligence it may well be hoped that they will constantly diminish in frequency and violence,1837-VanBuren
the generous patriotism and sound common sense of the great mass of our fellow citizens will assuredly in time produce this result for as every assumption of illegal power not only wounds the majesty of the law but furnishes a pretext for abridging the liberties of the people the latter have the most direct and permanent interest in preserving the landmarks of social order and maintaining on all occasions the inviolability of those constitutional and legal provisions which they themselves have made,1837-VanBuren
in a supposed unfitness of our institutions for those hostile emergencies which no country can always avoid their friends found a fruitful source of apprehension their enemies of hope,1837-VanBuren
while they foresaw less promptness of action than in governments differently formed they overlooked the far more important consideration that with us war could never be the result of individual or irresponsible will but must be a measure of redress for injuries sustained voluntarily resorted to by those who were to bear the necessary sacrifice who would consequently feel an individual interest in the contest and whose energy would be commensurate with the difficulties to be encountered,1837-VanBuren
actual events have proved their error the last war far from impairing gave new confidence to our government and amid recent apprehensions of a similar conflict we saw that the energies of our country would not be wanting in ample season to vindicate its rights,1837-VanBuren
we may not possess as we should not desire to possess the extended and ever ready military organization of other nations we may occasionally suffer in the outset for the want of it but among ourselves all doubt upon this great point has ceased while a salutary experience will prevent a contrary opinion from inviting aggression from abroad,1837-VanBuren
certain danger was foretold from the extension of our territory the multiplication of states and the increase of population,1837-VanBuren
our system was supposed to be adapted only to boundaries comparatively narrow,1837-VanBuren
these have been widened beyond conjecture the members of our confederacy are already doubled and the numbers of our people are incredibly augmented,1837-VanBuren
the alleged causes of danger have long surpassed anticipation but none of the consequences have followed,1837-VanBuren
the power and influence of the republic have arisen to a height obvious to all mankind respect for its authority was not more apparent at its ancient than it is at its present limits new and inexhaustible sources of general prosperity have been opened the effects of distance have been averted by the inventive genius of our people developed and fostered by the spirit of our institutions and the enlarged variety and amount of interests productions and pursuits have strengthened the chain of mutual dependence and formed a circle of mutual benefits too apparent ever to be overlooked,1837-VanBuren
in justly balancing the powers of the federal and state authorities difficulties nearly insurmountable arose at the outset and subsequent collisions were deemed inevitable,1837-VanBuren
amid these it was scarcely believed possible that a scheme of government so complex in construction could remain uninjured,1837-VanBuren
from time to time embarrassments have certainly occurred but how just is the confidence of future safety imparted by the knowledge that each in succession has been happily removed,1837-VanBuren
overlooking partial and temporary evils as inseparable from the practical operation of all human institutions and looking only to the general result every patriot has reason to be satisfied,1837-VanBuren
while the federal government has successfully performed its appropriate functions in relation to foreign affairs and concerns evidently national that of every state has remarkably improved in protecting and developing local interests and individual welfare and if the vibrations of authority have occasionally tended too much toward one or the other it is unquestionably certain that the ultimate operation of the entire system has been to strengthen all the existing institutions and to elevate our whole country in prosperity and renown,1837-VanBuren
the last perhaps the greatest of the prominent sources of discord and disaster supposed to lurk in our political condition was the institution of domestic slavery,1837-VanBuren
our forefathers were deeply impressed with the delicacy of this subject and they treated it with a forbearance so evidently wise that in spite of every sinister foreboding it never until the present period disturbed the tranquillity of our common country,1837-VanBuren
such a result is sufficient evidence of the justice and the patriotism of their course it is evidence not to be mistaken that an adherence to it can prevent all embarrassment from this as well as from every other anticipated cause of difficulty or danger,1837-VanBuren
have not recent events made it obvious to the slightest reflection that the least deviation from this spirit of forbearance is injurious to every interest that of humanity included,1837-VanBuren
amidst the violence of excited passions this generous and fraternal feeling has been sometimes disregarded and standing as i now do before my countrymen in this high place of honor and of trust i can not refrain from anxiously invoking my fellow citizens never to be deaf to its dictates,1837-VanBuren
perceiving before my election the deep interest this subject was beginning to excite i believed it a solemn duty fully to make known my sentiments in regard to it and now when every motive for misrepresentation has passed away i trust that they will be candidly weighed and understood,1837-VanBuren
at least they will be my standard of conduct in the path before me,1837-VanBuren
i then declared that if the desire of those of my countrymen who were favorable to my election was gratified i must go into the presidential chair the inflexible and uncompromising opponent of every attempt on the part of congress to abolish slavery in the district of columbia against the wishes of the slaveholding states and also with a determination equally decided to resist the slightest interference with it in the states where it exists,1837-VanBuren
i submitted also to my fellow citizens with fullness and frankness the reasons which led me to this determination,1837-VanBuren
the result authorizes me to believe that they have been approved and are confided in by a majority of the people of the united states including those whom they most immediately affect it now only remains to add that no bill conflicting with these views can ever receive my constitutional sanction,1837-VanBuren
these opinions have been adopted in the firm belief that they are in accordance with the spirit that actuated the venerated fathers of the republic and that succeeding experience has proved them to be humane patriotic expedient honorable and just,1837-VanBuren
if the agitation of this subject was intended to reach the stability of our institutions enough has occurred to show that it has signally failed and that in this as in every other instance the apprehensions of the timid and the hopes of the wicked for the destruction of our government are again destined to be disappointed,1837-VanBuren
here and there indeed scenes of dangerous excitement have occurred terrifying instances of local violence have been witnessed and a reckless disregard of the consequences of their conduct has exposed individuals to popular indignation but neither masses of the people nor sections of the country have been swerved from their devotion to the bond of union and the principles it has made sacred,1837-VanBuren
it will be ever thus,1837-VanBuren
such attempts at dangerous agitation may periodically return but with each the object will be better understood,1837-VanBuren
that predominating affection for our political system which prevails throughout our territorial limits that calm and enlightened judgment which ultimately governs our people as one vast body will always be at hand to resist and control every effort foreign or domestic which aims or would lead to overthrow our institutions,1837-VanBuren
what can be more gratifying than such a retrospect as this,1837-VanBuren
we look back on obstacles avoided and dangers overcome on expectations more than realized and prosperity perfectly secured,1837-VanBuren
to the hopes of the hostile the fears of the timid and the doubts of the anxious actual experience has given the conclusive reply,1837-VanBuren
we have seen time gradually dispel every unfavorable foreboding and our constitution surmount every adverse circumstance dreaded at the outset as beyond control,1837-VanBuren
present excitement will at all times magnify present dangers but true philosophy must teach us that none more threatening than the past can remain to be overcome and we ought for we have just reason to entertain an abiding confidence in the stability of our institutions and an entire conviction that if administered in the true form character and spirit in which they were established they are abundantly adequate to preserve to us and our children the rich blessings already derived from them to make our beloved land for a thousand generations that chosen spot where happiness springs from a perfect equality of political rights,1837-VanBuren
for myself therefore i desire to declare that the principle that will govern me in the high duty to which my country calls me is a strict adherence to the letter and spirit of the constitution as it was designed by those who framed it,1837-VanBuren
looking back to it as a sacred instrument carefully and not easily framed remembering that it was throughout a work of concession and compromise viewing it as limited to national objects regarding it as leaving to the people and the states all power not explicitly parted with i shall endeavor to preserve protect and defend it by anxiously referring to its provision for direction in every action,1837-VanBuren
to matters of domestic concernment which it has intrusted to the federal government and to such as relate to our intercourse with foreign nations i shall zealously devote myself beyond those limits i shall never pass,1837-VanBuren
to enter on this occasion into a further or more minute exposition of my views on the various questions of domestic policy would be as obtrusive as it is probably unexpected,1837-VanBuren
before the suffrages of my countrymen were conferred upon me i submitted to them with great precision my opinions on all the most prominent of these subjects,1837-VanBuren
those opinions i shall endeavor to carry out with my utmost ability,1837-VanBuren
our course of foreign policy has been so uniform and intelligible as to constitute a rule of executive conduct which leaves little to my discretion unless indeed i were willing to run counter to the lights of experience and the known opinions of my constituents,1837-VanBuren
we sedulously cultivate the friendship of all nations as the conditions most compatible with our welfare and the principles of our government,1837-VanBuren
we decline alliances as adverse to our peace,1837-VanBuren
we desire commercial relations on equal terms being ever willing to give a fair equivalent for advantages received,1837-VanBuren
we endeavor to conduct our intercourse with openness and sincerity promptly avowing our objects and seeking to establish that mutual frankness which is as beneficial in the dealings of nations as of men,1837-VanBuren
we have no disposition and we disclaim all right to meddle in disputes whether internal or foreign that may molest other countries regarding them in their actual state as social communities and preserving a strict neutrality in all their controversies,1837-VanBuren
well knowing the tried valor of our people and our exhaustless resources we neither anticipate nor fear any designed aggression and in the consciousness of our own just conduct we feel a security that we shall never be called upon to exert our determination never to permit an invasion of our rights without punishment or redress,1837-VanBuren
in approaching then in the presence of my assembled countrymen to make the solemn promise that yet remains and to pledge myself that i will faithfully execute the office i am about to fill i bring with me a settled purpose to maintain the institutions of my country which i trust will atone for the errors i commit,1837-VanBuren
in receiving from the people the sacred trust twice confided to my illustrious predecessor and which he has discharged so faithfully and so well i know that i can not expect to perform the arduous task with equal ability and success,1837-VanBuren
but united as i have been in his counsels a daily witness of his exclusive and unsurpassed devotion to his country s welfare agreeing with him in sentiments which his countrymen have warmly supported and permitted to partake largely of his confidence i may hope that somewhat of the same cheering approbation will be found to attend upon my path,1837-VanBuren
for him i but express with my own the wishes of all that he may yet long live to enjoy the brilliant evening of his well spent life and for myself conscious of but one desire faithfully to serve my country i throw myself without fear on its justice and its kindness,1837-VanBuren
beyond that i only look to the gracious protection of the divine being whose strengthening support i humbly solicit and whom i fervently pray to look down upon us all,1837-VanBuren
may it be among the dispensations of his providence to bless our beloved country with honors and with length of days,1837-VanBuren
may her ways be ways of pleasantness and all her paths be peace,1837-VanBuren
called from a retirement which i had supposed was to continue for the residue of my life to fill the chief executive office of this great and free nation i appear before you fellow citizens to take the oaths which the constitution prescribes as a necessary qualification for the performance of its duties and in obedience to a custom coeval with our government and what i believe to be your expectations i proceed to present to you a summary of the principles which will govern me in the discharge of the duties which i shall be called upon to perform,1841-Harrison
it was the remark of a roman consul in an early period of that celebrated republic that a most striking contrast was observable in the conduct of candidates for offices of power and trust before and after obtaining them they seldom carrying out in the latter case the pledges and promises made in the former,1841-Harrison
however much the world may have improved in many respects in the lapse of upward of two thousand years since the remark was made by the virtuous and indignant roman i fear that a strict examination of the annals of some of the modern elective governments would develop similar instances of violated confidence,1841-Harrison
although the fiat of the people has gone forth proclaiming me the chief magistrate of this glorious union nothing upon their part remaining to be done it may be thought that a motive may exist to keep up the delusion under which they may be supposed to have acted in relation to my principles and opinions and perhaps there may be some in this assembly who have come here either prepared to condemn those i shall now deliver or approving them to doubt the sincerity with which they are now uttered,1841-Harrison
but the lapse of a few months will confirm or dispel their fears,1841-Harrison
the outline of principles to govern and measures to be adopted by an administration not yet begun will soon be exchanged for immutable history and i shall stand either exonerated by my countrymen or classed with the mass of those who promised that they might deceive and flattered with the intention to betray,1841-Harrison
however strong may be my present purpose to realize the expectations of a magnanimous and confiding people i too well understand the dangerous temptations to which i shall be exposed from the magnitude of the power which it has been the pleasure of the people to commit to my hands not to place my chief confidence upon the aid of that almighty power which has hitherto protected me and enabled me to bring to favorable issues other important but still greatly inferior trusts heretofore confided to me by my country,1841-Harrison
the broad foundation upon which our constitution rests being the people a breath of theirs having made as a breath can unmake change or modify it it can be assigned to none of the great divisions of government but to that of democracy,1841-Harrison
if such is its theory those who are called upon to administer it must recognize as its leading principle the duty of shaping their measures so as to produce the greatest good to the greatest number,1841-Harrison
but with these broad admissions if we would compare the sovereignty acknowledged to exist in the mass of our people with the power claimed by other sovereignties even by those which have been considered most purely democratic we shall find a most essential difference,1841-Harrison
all others lay claim to power limited only by their own will,1841-Harrison
the majority of our citizens on the contrary possess a sovereignty with an amount of power precisely equal to that which has been granted to them by the parties to the national compact and nothing beyond,1841-Harrison
we admit of no government by divine right believing that so far as power is concerned the beneficent creator has made no distinction amongst men that all are upon an equality and that the only legitimate right to govern is an express grant of power from the governed,1841-Harrison
the constitution of the united states is the instrument containing this grant of power to the several departments composing the government,1841-Harrison
on an examination of that instrument it will be found to contain declarations of power granted and of power withheld,1841-Harrison
the latter is also susceptible of division into power which the majority had the right to grant but which they do not think proper to intrust to their agents and that which they could not have granted not being possessed by themselves,1841-Harrison
in other words there are certain rights possessed by each individual american citizen which in his compact with the others he has never surrendered,1841-Harrison
some of them indeed he is unable to surrender being in the language of our system unalienable,1841-Harrison
the boasted privilege of a roman citizen was to him a shield only against a petty provincial ruler whilst the proud democrat of athens would console himself under a sentence of death for a supposed violation of the national faith which no one understood and which at times was the subject of the mockery of all or the banishment from his home his family and his country with or without an alleged cause that it was the act not of a single tyrant or hated aristocracy but of his assembled countrymen,1841-Harrison
far different is the power of our sovereignty,1841-Harrison
it can interfere with no one s faith prescribe forms of worship for no one s observance inflict no punishment but after well ascertained guilt the result of investigation under rules prescribed by the constitution itself,1841-Harrison
these precious privileges and those scarcely less important of giving expression to his thoughts and opinions either by writing or speaking unrestrained but by the liability for injury to others and that of a full participation in all the advantages which flow from the government the acknowledged property of all the american citizen derives from no charter granted by his fellow man,1841-Harrison
he claims them because he is himself a man fashioned by the same almighty hand as the rest of his species and entitled to a full share of the blessings with which he has endowed them,1841-Harrison
notwithstanding the limited sovereignty possessed by the people of the united stages and the restricted grant of power to the government which they have adopted enough has been given to accomplish all the objects for which it was created,1841-Harrison
it has been found powerful in war and hitherto justice has been administered and intimate union effected domestic tranquillity preserved and personal liberty secured to the citizen,1841-Harrison
as was to be expected however from the defect of language and the necessarily sententious manner in which the constitution is written disputes have arisen as to the amount of power which it has actually granted or was intended to grant,1841-Harrison
this is more particularly the case in relation to that part of the instrument which treats of the legislative branch and not only as regards the exercise of powers claimed under a general clause giving that body the authority to pass all laws necessary to carry into effect the specified powers but in relation to the latter also,1841-Harrison
it is however consolatory to reflect that most of the instances of alleged departure from the letter or spirit of the constitution have ultimately received the sanction of a majority of the people,1841-Harrison
and the fact that many of our statesmen most distinguished for talent and patriotism have been at one time or other of their political career on both sides of each of the most warmly disputed questions forces upon us the inference that the errors if errors there were are attributable to the intrinsic difficulty in many instances of ascertaining the intentions of the framers of the constitution rather than the influence of any sinister or unpatriotic motive,1841-Harrison
but the great danger to our institutions does not appear to me to be in a usurpation by the government of power not granted by the people but by the accumulation in one of the departments of that which was assigned to others,1841-Harrison
limited as are the powers which have been granted still enough have been granted to constitute a despotism if concentrated in one of the departments,1841-Harrison
this danger is greatly heightened as it has been always observable that men are less jealous of encroachments of one department upon another than upon their own reserved rights,1841-Harrison
when the constitution of the united states first came from the hands of the convention which formed it many of the sternest republicans of the day were alarmed at the extent of the power which had been granted to the federal government and more particularly of that portion which had been assigned to the executive branch,1841-Harrison
there were in it features which appeared not to be in harmony with their ideas of a simple representative democracy or republic and knowing the tendency of power to increase itself particularly when exercised by a single individual predictions were made that at no very remote period the government would terminate in virtual monarchy,1841-Harrison
it would not become me to say that the fears of these patriots have been already realized but as i sincerely believe that the tendency of measures and of men s opinions for some years past has been in that direction it is i conceive strictly proper that i should take this occasion to repeat the assurances i have heretofore given of my determination to arrest the progress of that tendency if it really exists and restore the government to its pristine health and vigor as far as this can be effected by any legitimate exercise of the power placed in my hands,1841-Harrison
i proceed to state in as summary a manner as i can my opinion of the sources of the evils which have been so extensively complained of and the correctives which may be applied,1841-Harrison
some of the former are unquestionably to be found in the defects of the constitution others in my judgment are attributable to a misconstruction of some of its provisions,1841-Harrison
of the former is the eligibility of the same individual to a second term of the presidency,1841-Harrison
the sagacious mind of mr jefferson early saw and lamented this error and attempts have been made hitherto without success to apply the amendatory power of the states to its correction,1841-Harrison
as however one mode of correction is in the power of every president and consequently in mine it would be useless and perhaps invidious to enumerate the evils of which in the opinion of many of our fellow citizens this error of the sages who framed the constitution may have been the source and the bitter fruits which we are still to gather from it if it continues to disfigure our system,1841-Harrison
it may be observed however as a general remark that republics can commit no greater error than to adopt or continue any feature in their systems of government which may be calculated to create or increase the lover of power in the bosoms of those to whom necessity obliges them to commit the management of their affairs and surely nothing is more likely to produce such a state of mind than the long continuance of an office of high trust,1841-Harrison
nothing can be more corrupting nothing more destructive of all those noble feelings which belong to the character of a devoted republican patriot,1841-Harrison
when this corrupting passion once takes possession of the human mind like the love of gold it becomes insatiable,1841-Harrison
it is the never dying worm in his bosom grows with his growth and strengthens with the declining years of its victim,1841-Harrison
if this is true it is the part of wisdom for a republic to limit the service of that officer at least to whom she has intrusted the management of her foreign relations the execution of her laws and the command of her armies and navies to a period so short as to prevent his forgetting that he is the accountable agent not the principal the servant not the master,1841-Harrison
until an amendment of the constitution can be effected public opinion may secure the desired object,1841-Harrison
i give my aid to it by renewing the pledge heretofore given that under no circumstances will i consent to serve a second term,1841-Harrison
but if there is danger to public liberty from the acknowledged defects of the constitution in the want of limit to the continuance of the executive power in the same hands there is i apprehend not much less from a misconstruction of that instrument as it regards the powers actually given,1841-Harrison
i can not conceive that by a fair construction any or either of its provisions would be found to constitute the president a part of the legislative power,1841-Harrison
it can not be claimed from the power to recommend since although enjoined as a duty upon him it is a privilege which he holds in common with every other citizen and although there may be something more of confidence in the propriety of the measures recommended in the one case than in the other in the obligations of ultimate decision there can be no difference,1841-Harrison
in the language of the constitution all the legislative powers which it grants are vested in the congress of the united states,1841-Harrison
it would be a solecism in language to say that any portion of these is not included in the whole,1841-Harrison
it may be said indeed that the constitution has given to the executive the power to annul the acts of the legislative body by refusing to them his assent,1841-Harrison
so a similar power has necessarily resulted from that instrument to the judiciary and yet the judiciary forms no part of the legislature,1841-Harrison
there is it is true this difference between these grants of power the executive can put his negative upon the acts of the legislature for other cause than that of want of conformity to the constitution whilst the judiciary can only declare void those which violate that instrument,1841-Harrison
but the decision of the judiciary is final in such a case whereas in every instance where the veto of the executive is applied it may be overcome by a vote of two thirds of both houses of congress,1841-Harrison
the negative upon the acts of the legislative by the executive authority and that in the hands of one individual would seem to be an incongruity in our system,1841-Harrison
like some others of a similar character however it appears to be highly expedient and if used only with the forbearance and in the spirit which was intended by its authors it may be productive of great good and be found one of the best safeguards to the union,1841-Harrison
at the period of the formation of the constitution the principle does not appear to have enjoyed much favor in the state governments,1841-Harrison
it existed but in two and in one of these there was a plural executive,1841-Harrison
if we would search for the motives which operated upon the purely patriotic and enlightened assembly which framed the constitution for the adoption of a provision so apparently repugnant to the leading democratic principle that the majority should govern we must reject the idea that they anticipated from it any benefit to the ordinary course of legislation,1841-Harrison
they knew too well the high degree of intelligence which existed among the people and the enlightened character of the state legislatures not to have the fullest confidence that the two bodies elected by them would be worthy representatives of such constituents and of course that they would require no aid in conceiving and maturing the measures which the circumstances of the country might require,1841-Harrison
and it is preposterous to suppose that a thought could for a moment have been entertained that the president placed at the capital in the center of the country could better understand the wants and wishes of the people than their own immediate representatives who spend a part of every year among them living with them often laboring with them and bound to them by the triple tie of interest duty and affection,1841-Harrison
to assist or control congress then in its ordinary legislation could not i conceive have been the motive for conferring the veto power on the president,1841-Harrison
this argument acquires additional force from the fact of its never having been thus used by the first six presidents and two of them were members of the convention one presiding over its deliberations and the other bearing a larger share in consummating the labors of that august body than any other person,1841-Harrison
but if bills were never returned to congress by either of the presidents above referred to upon the ground of their being inexpedient or not as well adapted as they might be to the wants of the people the veto was applied upon that of want of conformity to the constitution or because errors had been committed from a too hasty enactment,1841-Harrison
there is another ground for the adoption of the veto principle which had probably more influence in recommending it to the convention than any other,1841-Harrison
i refer to the security which it gives to the just and equitable action of the legislature upon all parts of the union,1841-Harrison
it could not but have occurred to the convention that in a country so extensive embracing so great a variety of soil and climate and consequently of products and which from the same causes must ever exhibit a great difference in the amount of the population of its various sections calling for a great diversity in the employments of the people that the legislation of the majority might not always justly regard the rights and interests of the minority and that acts of this character might be passed under an express grant by the words of the constitution and therefore not within the competency of the judiciary to declare void that however enlightened and patriotic they might suppose from past experience the members of congress might be and however largely partaking in the general of the liberal feelings of the people it was impossible to expect that bodies so constituted should not sometimes be controlled by local interests and sectional feelings,1841-Harrison
it was proper therefore to provide some umpire from whose situation and mode of appointment more independence and freedom from such influences might be expected,1841-Harrison
such a one was afforded by the executive department constituted by the constitution,1841-Harrison
a person elected to that high office having his constituents in every section state and subdivision of the union must consider himself bound by the most solemn sanctions to guard protect and defend the rights of all and of every portion great or small from the injustice and oppression of the rest,1841-Harrison
i consider the veto power therefore given by the constitution to the executive of the united states solely as a conservative power to be used only first to protect the constitution from violation secondly the people from the effects of hasty legislation where their will has been probably disregarded or not well understood and thirdly to prevent the effects of combinations violative of the rights of minorities,1841-Harrison
in reference to the second of these objects i may observe that i consider it the right and privilege of the people to decide disputed points of the constitution arising from the general grant of power to congress to carry into effect the powers expressly given and i believe with mr madison that repeated recognitions under varied circumstances in acts of the legislative executive and judicial branches of the government accompanied by indications in different modes of the concurrence of the general will of the nation as affording to the president sufficient authority for his considering such disputed points as settled,1841-Harrison
upward of half a century has elapsed since the adoption of the present form of government,1841-Harrison
it would be an object more highly desirable than the gratification of the curiosity of speculative statesmen if its precise situation could be ascertained a fair exhibit made of the operations of each of its departments of the powers which they respectively claim and exercise of the collisions which have occurred between them or between the whole government and those of the states or either of them,1841-Harrison
we could then compare our actual condition after fifty years trial of our system with what it was in the commencement of its operations and ascertain whether the predictions of the patriots who opposed its adoption or the confident hopes of its advocates have been best realized,1841-Harrison
the great dread of the former seems to have been that the reserved powers of the states would be absorbed by those of the federal government and a consolidated power established leaving to the states the shadow only of that independent action for which they had so zealously contended and on the preservation of which they relied as the last hope of liberty,1841-Harrison
without denying that the result to which they looked with so much apprehension is in the way of being realized it is obvious that they did not clearly see the mode of its accomplishment the general government has seized upon none of the reserved rights of the states,1841-Harrison
as far as any open warfare may have gone the state authorities have amply maintained their rights,1841-Harrison
to a casual observer our system presents no appearance of discord between the different members which compose it,1841-Harrison
even the addition of many new ones has produced no jarring,1841-Harrison
they move in their respective orbits in perfect harmony with the central head and with each other,1841-Harrison
but there is still an undercurrent at work by which if not seasonably checked the worst apprehensions of our antifederal patriots will be realized and not only will the state authorities be overshadowed by the great increase of power in the executive department of the general government but the character of that government if not its designation be essentially and radically changed,1841-Harrison
this state of things has been in part effected by causes inherent in the constitution and in part by the never failing tendency of political power to increase itself,1841-Harrison
by making the president the sole distributer of all the patronage of the government the framers of the constitution do not appear to have anticipated at how short a period it would become a formidable instrument to control the free operations of the state governments,1841-Harrison
of trifling importance at first it had early in mr jefferson s administration become so powerful as to create great alarm in the mind of that patriot from the potent influence it might exert in controlling the freedom of the elective franchise,1841-Harrison
if such could have then been the effects of its influence how much greater must be the danger at this time quadrupled in amount as it certainly is and more completely under the control of the executive will than their construction of their powers allowed or the forbearing characters of all the early presidents permitted them to make,1841-Harrison
but it is not by the extent of its patronage alone that the executive department has become dangerous but by the use which it appears may be made of the appointing power to bring under its control the whole revenues of the country,1841-Harrison
the constitution has declared it to be the duty of the president to see that the laws are executed and it makes him the commander in chief of the armies and navy of the united states,1841-Harrison
if the opinion of the most approved writers upon that species of mixed government which in modern europe is termed monarchy in contradistinction to despotism is correct there was wanting no other addition to the powers of our chief magistrate to stamp a monarchical character on our government but the control of the public finances and to me it appears strange indeed that anyone should doubt that the entire control which the president possesses over the officers who have the custody of the public money by the power of removal with or without cause does for all mischievous purposes at least virtually subject the treasure also to his disposal,1841-Harrison
the first roman emperor in his attempt to seize the sacred treasure silenced the opposition of the officer to whose charge it had been committed by a significant allusion to his sword,1841-Harrison
by a selection of political instruments for the care of the public money a reference to their commissions by a president would be quite as effectual an argument as that of caesar to the roman knight,1841-Harrison
i am not insensible of the great difficulty that exists in drawing a proper plan for the safe keeping and disbursement of the public revenues and i know the importance which has been attached by men of great abilities and patriotism to the divorce as it is called of the treasury from the banking institutions it is not the divorce which is complained of but the unhallowed union of the treasury with the executive department which has created such extensive alarm,1841-Harrison
to this danger to our republican institutions and that created by the influence given to the executive through the instrumentality of the federal officers i propose to apply all the remedies which may be at my command,1841-Harrison
it was certainly a great error in the framers of the constitution not to have made the officer at the head of the treasury department entirely independent of the executive,1841-Harrison
he should at least have been removable only upon the demand of the popular branch of the legislature,1841-Harrison
i have determined never to remove a secretary of the treasury without communicating all the circumstances attending such removal to both houses of congress,1841-Harrison
the influence of the executive in controlling the freedom of the elective franchise through the medium of the public officers can be effectually checked by renewing the prohibition published by mr jefferson forbidding their interference in elections further than giving their own votes and their own independence secured by an assurance of perfect immunity in exercising this sacred privilege of freemen under the dictates of their own unbiased judgments,1841-Harrison
never with my consent shall an officer of the people compensated for his services out of their pockets become the pliant instrument of executive will,1841-Harrison
there is no part of the means placed in the hands of the executive which might be used with greater effect for unhallowed purposes than the control of the public press,1841-Harrison
the maxim which our ancestors derived from the mother country that the freedom of the press is the great bulwark of civil and religious liberty is one of the most precious legacies which they have left us,1841-Harrison
we have learned too from our own as well as the experience of other countries that golden shackles by whomsoever or by whatever pretense imposed are as fatal to it as the iron bonds of despotism,1841-Harrison
the presses in the necessary employment of the government should never be used to clear the guilty or to varnish crime,1841-Harrison
a decent and manly examination of the acts of the government should be not only tolerated but encouraged,1841-Harrison
upon another occasion i have given my opinion at some length upon the impropriety of executive interference in the legislation of congress that the article in the constitution making it the duty of the president to communicate information and authorizing him to recommend measures was not intended to make him the source in legislation and in particular that he should never be looked to for schemes of finance,1841-Harrison
it would be very strange indeed that the constitution should have strictly forbidden one branch of the legislature from interfering in the origination of such bills and that it should be considered proper that an altogether different department of the government should be permitted to do so,1841-Harrison
some of our best political maxims and opinions have been drawn from our parent isle,1841-Harrison
there are others however which can not be introduced in our system without singular incongruity and the production of much mischief and this i conceive to be one,1841-Harrison
no matter in which of the houses of parliament a bill may originate nor by whom introduced a minister or a member of the opposition by the fiction of law or rather of constitutional principle the sovereign is supposed to have prepared it agreeably to his will and then submitted it to parliament for their advice and consent,1841-Harrison
now the very reverse is the case here not only with regard to the principle but the forms prescribed by the constitution,1841-Harrison
the principle certainly assigns to the only body constituted by the constitution the legislative body the power to make laws and the forms even direct that the enactment should be ascribed to them,1841-Harrison
the senate in relation to revenue bills have the right to propose amendments and so has the executive by the power given him to return them to the house of representatives with his objections,1841-Harrison
it is in his power also to propose amendments in the existing revenue laws suggested by his observations upon their defective or injurious operation,1841-Harrison
but the delicate duty of devising schemes of revenue should be left where the constitution has placed it with the immediate representatives of the people,1841-Harrison
for similar reasons the mode of keeping the public treasure should be prescribed by them and the further removed it may be from the control of the executive the more wholesome the arrangement and the more in accordance with republican principle,1841-Harrison
connected with this subject is the character of the currency,1841-Harrison
the idea of making it exclusively metallic however well intended appears to me to be fraught with more fatal consequences than any other scheme having no relation to the personal rights of the citizens that has ever been devised,1841-Harrison
if any single scheme could produce the effect of arresting at once that mutation of condition by which thousands of our most indigent fellow citizens by their industry and enterprise are raised to the possession of wealth that is the one,1841-Harrison
if there is one measure better calculated than another to produce that state of things so much deprecated by all true republicans by which the rich are daily adding to their hoards and the poor sinking deeper into penury it is an exclusive metallic currency,1841-Harrison
or if there is a process by which the character of the country for generosity and nobleness of feeling may be destroyed by the great increase and neck toleration of usury it is an exclusive metallic currency,1841-Harrison
amongst the other duties of a delicate character which the president is called upon to perform is the supervision of the government of the territories of the united states,1841-Harrison
those of them which are destined to become members of our great political family are compensated by their rapid progress from infancy to manhood for the partial and temporary deprivation of their political rights,1841-Harrison
it is in this district only where american citizens are to be found who under a settled policy are deprived of many important political privileges without any inspiring hope as to the future,1841-Harrison
their only consolation under circumstances of such deprivation is that of the devoted exterior guards of a camp that their sufferings secure tranquillity and safety within,1841-Harrison
are there any of their countrymen who would subject them to greater sacrifices to any other humiliations than those essentially necessary to the security of the object for which they were thus separated from their fellow citizens,1841-Harrison
are their rights alone not to be guaranteed by the application of those great principles upon which all our constitutions are founded,1841-Harrison
we are told by the greatest of british orators and statesmen that at the commencement of the war of the revolution the most stupid men in england spoke of their american subjects,1841-Harrison
are there indeed citizens of any of our states who have dreamed of their subjects in the district of columbia,1841-Harrison
such dreams can never be realized by any agency of mine,1841-Harrison
the people of the district of columbia are not the subjects of the people of the states but free american citizens,1841-Harrison
being in the latter condition when the constitution was formed no words used in that instrument could have been intended to deprive them of that character,1841-Harrison
if there is anything in the great principle of unalienable rights so emphatically insisted upon in our declaration of independence they could neither make nor the united states accept a surrender of their liberties and become the subjects in other words the slaves of their former fellow citizens,1841-Harrison
if this be true and it will scarcely be denied by anyone who has a correct idea of his own rights as an american citizen the grant to congress of exclusive jurisdiction in the district of columbia can be interpreted so far as respects the aggregate people of the united states as meaning nothing more than to allow to congress the controlling power necessary to afford a free and safe exercise of the functions assigned to the general government by the constitution,1841-Harrison
in all other respects the legislation of congress should be adapted to their peculiar position and wants and be conformable with their deliberate opinions of their own interests,1841-Harrison
i have spoken of the necessity of keeping the respective departments of the government as well as all the other authorities of our country within their appropriate orbits,1841-Harrison
this is a matter of difficulty in some cases as the powers which they respectively claim are often not defined by any distinct lines,1841-Harrison
mischievous however in their tendencies as collisions of this kind may be those which arise between the respective communities which for certain purposes compose one nation are much more so for no such nation can long exist without the careful culture of those feelings of confidence and affection which are the effective bonds to union between free and confederated states,1841-Harrison
strong as is the tie of interest it has been often found ineffectual,1841-Harrison
men blinded by their passions have been known to adopt measures for their country in direct opposition to all the suggestions of policy,1841-Harrison
the alternative then is to destroy or keep down a bad passion by creating and fostering a good one and this seems to be the corner stone upon which our american political architects have reared the fabric of our government,1841-Harrison
the cement which was to bind it and perpetuate its existence was the affectionate attachment between all its members,1841-Harrison
to insure the continuance of this feeling produced at first by a community of dangers of sufferings and of interests the advantages of each were made accessible to all,1841-Harrison
no participation in any good possessed by any member of our extensive confederacy except in domestic government was withheld from the citizen of any other member,1841-Harrison
by a process attended with no difficulty no delay no expense but that of removal the citizen of one might become the citizen of any other and successively of the whole,1841-Harrison
the lines too separating powers to be exercised by the citizens of one state from those of another seem to be so distinctly drawn as to leave no room for misunderstanding,1841-Harrison
the citizens of each state unite in their persons all the privileges which that character confers and all that they may claim as citizens of the united states but in no case can the same persons at the same time act as the citizen of two separate states and he is therefore positively precluded from any interference with the reserved powers of any state but that of which he is for the time being a citizen,1841-Harrison
he may indeed offer to the citizens of other states his advice as to their management and the form in which it is tendered is left to his own discretion and sense of propriety,1841-Harrison
it may be observed however that organized associations of citizens requiring compliance with their wishes too much resemble the recommendations of athens to her allies supported by an armed and powerful fleet,1841-Harrison
it was indeed to the ambition of the leading states of greece to control the domestic concerns of the others that the destruction of that celebrated confederacy and subsequently of all its members is mainly to be attributed and it is owing to the absence of that spirit that the helvetic confederacy has for so many years been preserved,1841-Harrison
never has there been seen in the institutions of the separate members of any confederacy more elements of discord,1841-Harrison
in the principles and forms of government and religion as well as in the circumstances of the several cantons so marked a discrepancy was observable as to promise anything but harmony in their intercourse or permanency in their alliance and yet for ages neither has been interrupted,1841-Harrison
content with the positive benefits which their union produced with the independence and safety from foreign aggression which it secured these sagacious people respected the institutions of each other however repugnant to their own principles and prejudices,1841-Harrison
our confederacy fellow citizens can only be preserved by the same forbearance,1841-Harrison
our citizens must be content with the exercise of the powers with which the constitution clothes them,1841-Harrison
the attempt of those of one state to control the domestic institutions of another can only result in feelings of distrust and jealousy the certain harbingers of disunion violence and civil war and the ultimate destruction of our free institutions,1841-Harrison
our confederacy is perfectly illustrated by the terms and principles governing a common copartnership there is a fund of power to be exercised under the direction of the joint councils of the allied members but that which has been reserved by the individual members is intangible by the common government or the individual members composing it,1841-Harrison
to attempt it finds no support in the principles of our constitution,1841-Harrison
it should be our constant and earnest endeavor mutually to cultivate a spirit of concord and harmony among the various parts of our confederacy,1841-Harrison
experience has abundantly taught us that the agitation by citizens of one part of the union of a subject not confided to the general government but exclusively under the guardianship of the local authorities is productive of no other consequences than bitterness alienation discord and injury to the very cause which is intended to be advanced,1841-Harrison
of all the great interests which appertain to our country that of union cordial confiding fraternal union is by far the most important since it is the only true and sure guaranty of all others,1841-Harrison
in consequence of the embarrassed state of business and the currency some of the states may meet with difficulty in their financial concerns,1841-Harrison
however deeply we may regret anything imprudent or excessive in the engagements into which states have entered for purposes of their own it does not become us to disparage the states governments nor to discourage them from making proper efforts for their own relief,1841-Harrison
on the contrary it is our duty to encourage them to the extent of our constitutional authority to apply their best means and cheerfully to make all necessary sacrifices and submit to all necessary burdens to fulfill their engagements and maintain their credit for the character and credit of the several states form a part of the character and credit of the whole country,1841-Harrison
the resources of the country are abundant the enterprise and activity of our people proverbial and we may well hope that wise legislation and prudent administration by the respective governments each acting within its own sphere will restore former prosperity,1841-Harrison
unpleasant and even dangerous as collisions may sometimes be between the constituted authorities of the citizens of our country in relation to the lines which separate their respective jurisdictions the results can be of no vital injury to our institutions if that ardent patriotism that devoted attachment to liberty that spirit of moderation and forbearance for which our countrymen were once distinguished continue to be cherished,1841-Harrison
if this continues to be the ruling passion of our souls the weaker feeling of the mistaken enthusiast will be corrected the utopian dreams of the scheming politician dissipated and the complicated intrigues of the demagogue rendered harmless,1841-Harrison
the spirit of liberty is the sovereign balm for every injury which our institutions may receive,1841-Harrison
on the contrary no care that can be used in the construction of our government no division of powers no distribution of checks in its several departments will prove effectual to keep us a free people if this spirit is suffered to decay and decay it will without constant nurture,1841-Harrison
to the neglect of this duty the best historians agree in attributing the ruin of all the republics with whose existence and fall their writings have made us acquainted,1841-Harrison
the same causes will ever produce the same effects and as long as the love of power is a dominant passion of the human bosom and as long as the understandings of men can be warped and their affections changed by operations upon their passions and prejudices so long will the liberties of a people depend on their own constant attention to its preservation,1841-Harrison
the danger to all well established free governments arises from the unwillingness of the people to believe in its existence or from the influence of designing men diverting their attention from the quarter whence it approaches to a source from which it can never come,1841-Harrison
this is the old trick of those who would usurp the government of their country,1841-Harrison
in the name of democracy they speak warning the people against the influence of wealth and the danger of aristocracy,1841-Harrison
history ancient and modern is full of such examples,1841-Harrison
caesar became the master of the roman people and the senate under the pretense of supporting the democratic claims of the former against the aristocracy of the latter cromwell in the character of protector of the liberties of the people became the dictator of england and bolivar possessed himself of unlimited power with the title of his country s liberator,1841-Harrison
there is on the contrary no instance on record of an extensive and well established republic being changed into an aristocracy,1841-Harrison
the tendencies of all such governments in their decline is to monarchy and the antagonist principle to liberty there is the spirit of faction a spirit which assumes the character and in times of great excitement imposes itself upon the people as the genuine spirit of freedom and like the false christs whose coming was foretold by the savior seeks to and were it possible would impose upon the true and most faithful disciples of liberty,1841-Harrison
it is in periods like this that it behooves the people to be most watchful of those to whom they have intrusted power,1841-Harrison
and although there is at times much difficulty in distinguishing the false from the true spirit a calm and dispassionate investigation will detect the counterfeit as well by the character of its operations as the results that are produced,1841-Harrison
the true spirit of liberty although devoted persevering bold and uncompromising in principle that secured is mild and tolerant and scrupulous as to the means it employs whilst the spirit of party assuming to be that of liberty is harsh vindictive and intolerant and totally reckless as to the character of the allies which it brings to the aid of its cause,1841-Harrison
when the genuine spirit of liberty animates the body of a people to a thorough examination of their affairs it leads to the excision of every excrescence which may have fastened itself upon any of the departments of the government and restores the system to its pristine health and beauty,1841-Harrison
but the reign of an intolerant spirit of party amongst a free people seldom fails to result in a dangerous accession to the executive power introduced and established amidst unusual professions of devotion to democracy,1841-Harrison
the foregoing remarks relate almost exclusively to matters connected with our domestic concerns,1841-Harrison
it may be proper however that i should give some indications to my fellow citizens of my proposed course of conduct in the management of our foreign relations,1841-Harrison
i assure them therefore that it is my intention to use every means in my power to preserve the friendly intercourse which now so happily subsists with every foreign nation and that although of course not well informed as to the state of pending negotiations with any of them i see in the personal characters of the sovereigns as well as in the mutual interests of our own and of the governments with which our relations are most intimate a pleasing guaranty that the harmony so important to the interests of their subjects as well as of our citizens will not be interrupted by the advancement of any claim or pretension upon their part to which our honor would not permit us to yield,1841-Harrison
long the defender of my country s rights in the field i trust that my fellow citizens will not see in my earnest desire to preserve peace with foreign powers any indication that their rights will ever be sacrificed or the honor of the nation tarnished by any admission on the part of their chief magistrate unworthy of their former glory,1841-Harrison
in our intercourse with our aboriginal neighbors the same liberality and justice which marked the course prescribed to me by two of my illustrious predecessors when acting under their direction in the discharge of the duties of superintendent and commissioner shall be strictly observed,1841-Harrison
i can conceive of no more sublime spectacle none more likely to propitiate an impartial and common creator than a rigid adherence to the principles of justice on the part of a powerful nation in its transactions with a weaker and uncivilized people whom circumstances have placed at its disposal,1841-Harrison
before concluding fellow citizens i must say something to you on the subject of the parties at this time existing in our country,1841-Harrison
to me it appears perfectly clear that the interest of that country requires that the violence of the spirit by which those parties are at this time governed must be greatly mitigated if not entirely extinguished or consequences will ensue which are appalling to be thought of,1841-Harrison
if parties in a republic are necessary to secure a degree of vigilance sufficient to keep the public functionaries within the bounds of law and duty at that point their usefulness ends,1841-Harrison
beyond that they become destructive of public virtue the parent of a spirit antagonist to that of liberty and eventually its inevitable conqueror,1841-Harrison
we have examples of republics where the love of country and of liberty at one time were the dominant passions of the whole mass of citizens and yet with the continuance of the name and forms of free government not a vestige of these qualities remaining in the bosoms of any one of its citizens,1841-Harrison
it was the beautiful remark of a distinguished english writer that in the roman senate octavius had a party and anthony a party but the commonwealth had none,1841-Harrison
yet the senate continued to meet in the temple of liberty to talk of the sacredness and beauty of the commonwealth and gaze at the statues of the elder brutus and of the curtii and decii and the people assembled in the forum not as in the days of camillus and the scipios to cast their free votes for annual magistrates or pass upon the acts of the senate but to receive from the hands of the leaders of the respective parties their share of the spoils and to shout for one or the other as those collected in gaul or egypt and the lesser asia would furnish the larger dividend,1841-Harrison
the spirit of liberty had fled and avoiding the abodes of civilized man had sought protection in the wilds of scythia or scandinavia and so under the operation of the same causes and influences it will fly from our capitol and our forums,1841-Harrison
a calamity so awful not only to our country but to the world must be deprecated by every patriot and every tendency to a state of things likely to produce it immediately checked,1841-Harrison
such a tendency has existed does exist,1841-Harrison
always the friend of my countrymen never their flatterer it becomes my duty to say to them from this high place to which their partiality has exalted me that there exists in the land a spirit hostile to their best interests hostile to liberty itself,1841-Harrison
it is a spirit contracted in its views selfish in its objects,1841-Harrison
it looks to the aggrandizement of a few even to the destruction of the interests of the whole,1841-Harrison
the entire remedy is with the people,1841-Harrison
something however may be effected by the means which they have placed in my hands,1841-Harrison
it is union that we want not of a party for the sake of that party but a union of the whole country for the sake of the whole country for the defense of its interests and its honor against foreign aggression for the defense of those principles for which our ancestors so gloriously contended as far as it depends upon me it shall be accomplished,1841-Harrison
all the influence that i possess shall be exerted to prevent the formation at least of an executive party in the halls of the legislative body,1841-Harrison
i wish for the support of no member of that body to any measure of mine that does not satisfy his judgment and his sense of duty to those from whom he holds his appointment nor any confidence in advance from the people but that asked for by mr jefferson to give firmness and effect to the legal administration of their affairs,1841-Harrison
i deem the present occasion sufficiently important and solemn to justify me in expressing to my fellow citizens a profound reverence for the christian religion and a thorough conviction that sound morals religious liberty and a just sense of religious responsibility are essentially connected with all true and lasting happiness and to that good being who has blessed us by the gifts of civil and religious freedom who watched over and prospered the labors of our fathers and has hitherto preserved to us institutions far exceeding in excellence those of any other people let us unite in fervently commending every interest of our beloved country in all future time,1841-Harrison
fellow citizens being fully invested with that high office to which the partiality of my countrymen has called me i now take an affectionate leave of you,1841-Harrison
you will bear with you to your homes the remembrance of the pledge i have this day given to discharge all the high duties of my exalted station according to the best of my ability and i shall enter upon their performance with entire confidence in the support of a just and generous people,1841-Harrison
fellow citizens without solicitation on my part i have been chosen by the free and voluntary suffrages of my countrymen to the most honorable and most responsible office on earth,1845-Polk
i am deeply impressed with gratitude for the confidence reposed in me,1845-Polk
honored with this distinguished consideration at an earlier period of life than any of my predecessors i can not disguise the diffidence with which i am about to enter on the discharge of my official duties,1845-Polk
if the more aged and experienced men who have filled the office of president of the united states even in the infancy of the republic distrusted their ability to discharge the duties of that exalted station what ought not to be the apprehensions of one so much younger and less endowed now that our domain extends from ocean to ocean that our people have so greatly increased in numbers and at a time when so great diversity of opinion prevails in regard to the principles and policy which should characterize the administration of our government,1845-Polk
well may the boldest fear and the wisest tremble when incurring responsibilities on which may depend our country s peace and prosperity and in some degree the hopes and happiness of the whole human family,1845-Polk
in assuming responsibilities so vast i fervently invoke the aid of that almighty ruler of the universe in whose hands are the destinies of nations and of men to guard this heaven favored land against the mischiefs which without his guidance might arise from an unwise public policy,1845-Polk
with a firm reliance upon the wisdom of omnipotence to sustain and direct me in the path of duty which i am appointed to pursue i stand in the presence of this assembled multitude of my countrymen to take upon myself the solemn obligation to the best of my ability to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states,1845-Polk
a concise enumeration of the principles which will guide me in the administrative policy of the government is not only in accordance with the examples set me by all my predecessors but is eminently befitting the occasion,1845-Polk
the constitution itself plainly written as it is the safeguard of our federative compact the offspring of concession and compromise binding together in the bonds of peace and union this great and increasing family of free and independent states will be the chart by which i shall be directed,1845-Polk
it will be my first care to administer the government in the true spirit of that instrument and to assume no powers not expressly granted or clearly implied in its terms,1845-Polk
the government of the united states is one of delegated and limited powers arid it is by a strict adherence to the clearly granted powers and by abstaining from the exercise of doubtful or unauthorized implied powers that we have the only sure guaranty against the recurrence of those unfortunate collisions between the federal and state authorities which have occasionally so much disturbed the harmony of our system and even threatened the perpetuity of our glorious union,1845-Polk
to the states respectively or to the people have been reserved the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states,1845-Polk
each state is a complete sovereignty within the sphere of its reserved powers,1845-Polk
the government of the union acting within the sphere of its delegated authority is also a complete sovereignty,1845-Polk
while the general government should abstain from the exercise of authority not clearly delegated to it the states should be equally careful that in the maintenance of their rights they do not overstep the limits of powers reserved to them,1845-Polk
one of the most distinguished of my predecessors attached deserved importance to the support of the state governments in all their rights as the most competent administration for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwark against antirepublican tendencies and to the preservation of the general government in its whole constitutional vigor as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad,1845-Polk
to the government of the united states has been intrusted the exclusive management of our foreign affairs,1845-Polk
beyond that it wields a few general enumerated powers,1845-Polk
it does not force reform on the states,1845-Polk
it leaves individuals over whom it casts its protecting influence entirely free to improve their own condition by the legitimate exercise of all their mental and physical powers,1845-Polk
it is a common protector of each and all the states of every man who lives upon our soil whether of native or foreign birth of every religious sect in their worship of the almighty according to the dictates of their own conscience of every shade of opinion and the most free inquiry of every art trade and occupation consistent with the laws of the states,1845-Polk
and we rejoice in the general happiness prosperity and advancement of our country which have been the offspring of freedom and not of power,1845-Polk
this most admirable and wisest system of well regulated self government among men ever devised by human minds has been tested by its successful operation for more than half a century and if preserved from the usurpations of the federal government on the one hand and the exercise by the states of powers not reserved to them on the other will i fervently hope and believe endure for ages to come and dispense the blessings of civil and religious liberty to distant generations,1845-Polk
to effect objects so dear to every patriot i shall devote myself with anxious solicitude,1845-Polk
it will be my desire to guard against that most fruitful source of danger to the harmonious action of our system which consists in substituting the mere discretion and caprice of the executive or of majorities in the legislative department of the government for powers which have been withheld from the federal government by the constitution,1845-Polk
by the theory of our government majorities rule but this right is not an arbitrary or unlimited one,1845-Polk
it is a right to be exercised in subordination to the constitution and in conformity to it,1845-Polk
one great object of the constitution was to restrain majorities from oppressing minorities or encroaching upon their just rights,1845-Polk
minorities have a right to appeal to the constitution as a shield against such oppression,1845-Polk
that the blessings of liberty which our constitution secures may be enjoyed alike by minorities and majorities the executive has been wisely invested with a qualified veto upon the acts of the legislature,1845-Polk
it is a negative power and is conservative in its character,1845-Polk
it arrests for the time hasty inconsiderate or unconstitutional legislation invites reconsideration and transfers questions at issue between the legislative and executive departments to the tribunal of the people,1845-Polk
like all other powers it is subject to be abused,1845-Polk
when judiciously and properly exercised the constitution itself may be saved from infraction and the rights of all preserved and protected,1845-Polk
the inestimable value of our federal union is felt and acknowledged by all,1845-Polk
by this system of united and confederated states our people are permitted collectively arid individually to seek their own happiness in their own way and the consequences have been most auspicious,1845-Polk
since the union was formed the number of the states has increased from thirteen to twenty eight two of these have taken their position as members of the confederacy within the last week,1845-Polk
our population has increased from three to twenty millions,1845-Polk
new communities and states are seeking protection under its aegis and multitudes from the old world are flocking to our shores to participate in its blessings,1845-Polk
beneath its benign sway peace and prosperity prevail,1845-Polk
freed from the burdens and miseries of war our trade and intercourse have extended throughout the world,1845-Polk
mind no longer tasked in devising means to accomplish or resist schemes of ambition usurpation or conquest is devoting itself to man s true interests in developing his faculties and powers and the capacity of nature to minister to his enjoyments,1845-Polk
genius is free to announce its inventions and discoveries and the hand is free to accomplish whatever the head conceives not incompatible with the rights of a fellow being,1845-Polk
all distinctions of birth or of rank have been abolished,1845-Polk
all citizens whether native or adopted are placed upon terms of precise equality,1845-Polk
all are entitled to equal rights and equal protection,1845-Polk
no union exists between church and state and perfect freedom of opinion is guaranteed to all sects and creeds,1845-Polk
these are some of the blessings secured to our happy land by our federal union,1845-Polk
to perpetuate them it is our sacred duty to preserve it,1845-Polk
who shall assign limits to the achievements of free minds and free hands under the protection of this glorious union,1845-Polk
no treason to mankind since the organization of society would be equal in atrocity to that of him who would lift his hand to destroy it,1845-Polk
he would overthrow the noblest structure of human wisdom which protects himself and his fellow man,1845-Polk
he would stop the progress of free government and involve his country either in anarchy or despotism,1845-Polk
he would extinguish the fire of liberty which warms and animates the hearts of happy millions and invites all the nations of the earth to imitate our example,1845-Polk
if he say that error and wrong are committed in the administration of the government let him remember that nothing human can be perfect and that under no other system of government revealed by heaven or devised by man has reason been allowed so free and broad a scope to combat error,1845-Polk
has the sword of despots proved to be a safer or surer instrument of reform in government than enlightened reason,1845-Polk
does he expect to find among the ruins of this union a happier abode for our swarming millions than they now have under it,1845-Polk
every lover of his country must shudder at the thought of the possibility of its dissolution and will be ready to adopt the patriotic sentiment our federal union it must be preserved,1845-Polk
to preserve it the compromises which alone enabled our fathers to form a common constitution for the government and protection of so many states and distinct communities of such diversified habits interests and domestic institutions must be sacredly and religiously observed,1845-Polk
any attempt to disturb or destroy these compromises being terms of the compact of union can lead to none other than the most ruinous and disastrous consequences,1845-Polk
it is a source of deep regret that in some sections of our country misguided persons have occasionally indulged in schemes and agitations whose object is the destruction of domestic institutions existing in other sections institutions which existed at the adoption of the constitution and were recognized and protected by it,1845-Polk
all must see that if it were possible for them to be successful in attaining their object the dissolution of the union and the consequent destruction of our happy form of government must speedily follow,1845-Polk
i am happy to believe that at every period of our existence as a nation there has existed and continues to exist among the great mass of our people a devotion to the union of the states which will shield and protect it against the moral treason of any who would seriously contemplate its destruction,1845-Polk
to secure a continuance of that devotion the compromises of the constitution must not only be preserved but sectional jealousies and heartburnings must be discountenanced and all should remember that they are members of the same political family having a common destiny,1845-Polk
to increase the attachment of our people to the union our laws should be just,1845-Polk
any policy which shall tend to favor monopolies or the peculiar interests of sections or classes must operate to the prejudice of the interest of their fellow citizens and should be avoided,1845-Polk
if the compromises of the constitution be preserved if sectional jealousies and heartburnings be discountenanced if our laws be just and the government be practically administered strictly within the limits of power prescribed to it we may discard all apprehensions for the safety of the union,1845-Polk
with these views of the nature character and objects of the government and the value of the union i shall steadily oppose the creation of those institutions and systems which in their nature tend to pervert it from its legitimate purposes and make it the instrument of sections classes and individuals,1845-Polk
we need no national banks or other extraneous institutions planted around the government to control or strengthen it in opposition to the will of its authors,1845-Polk
experience has taught us how unnecessary they are as auxiliaries of the public authorities how impotent for good and how powerful for mischief,1845-Polk
ours was intended to be a plain and frugal government and i shall regard it to be my duty to recommend to congress and as far as the executive is concerned to enforce by all the means within my power the strictest economy in the expenditure of the public money which may be compatible with the public interests,1845-Polk
a national debt has become almost an institution of european monarchies,1845-Polk
it is viewed in some of them as an essential prop to existing governments,1845-Polk
melancholy is the condition of that people whose government can be sustained only by a system which periodically transfers large amounts from the labor of the many to the coffers of the few,1845-Polk
such a system is incompatible with the ends for which our republican government was instituted,1845-Polk
under a wise policy the debts contracted in our revolution and during the war of 1812 have been happily extinguished,1845-Polk
by a judicious application of the revenues not required for other necessary purposes it is not doubted that the debt which has grown out of the circumstances of the last few years may be speedily paid off,1845-Polk
i congratulate my fellow citizens on the entire restoration of the credit of the general government of the union and that of many of the states,1845-Polk
happy would it be for the indebted states if they were freed from their liabilities many of which were incautiously contracted,1845-Polk
although the government of the union is neither in a legal nor a moral sense bound for the debts of the states and it would be a violation of our compact of union to assume them yet we can not but feel a deep interest in seeing all the states meet their public liabilities and pay off their just debts at the earliest practicable period,1845-Polk
that they will do so as soon as it can be done without imposing too heavy burdens on their citizens there is no reason to doubt,1845-Polk
the sound moral and honorable feeling of the people of the indebted states can not be questioned and we are happy to perceive a settled disposition on their part as their ability returns after a season of unexampled pecuniary embarrassment to pay off all just demands and to acquiesce in any reasonable measures to accomplish that object,1845-Polk
one of the difficulties which we have had to encounter in the practical administration of the government consists in the adjustment of our revenue laws and the levy of the taxes necessary for the support of government,1845-Polk
in the general proposition that no more money shall be collected than the necessities of an economical administration shall require all parties seem to acquiesce,1845-Polk
nor does there seem to be any material difference of opinion as to the absence of right in the government to tax one section of country or one class of citizens or one occupation for the mere profit of another,1845-Polk
justice and sound policy forbid the federal government to foster one branch of industry to the detriment of another or to cherish the interests of one portion to the injury of another portion of our common country,1845-Polk
i have heretofore declared to my fellow citizens that in my judgment it is the duty of the government to extend as far as it may be practicable to do so by its revenue laws and all other means within its power fair and just protection to all of the great interests of the whole union embracing agriculture manufactures the mechanic arts commerce and navigation,1845-Polk
i have also declared my opinion to be in favor of a tariff for revenue and that in adjusting the details of such a tariff i have sanctioned such moderate discriminating duties as would produce the amount of revenue needed and at the same time afford reasonable incidental protection to our home industry and that i was opposed to a tariff for protection merely and not for revenue,1845-Polk
the power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises was an indispensable one to be conferred on the federal government which without it would possess no means of providing for its own support,1845-Polk
in executing this power by levying a tariff of duties for the support of government the raising of revenue should be the object and protection the incident,1845-Polk
to reverse this principle and make protection the object and revenue the incident would be to inflict manifest injustice upon all other than the protected interests,1845-Polk
in levying duties for revenue it is doubtless proper to make such discriminations within the revenue principle as will afford incidental protection to our home interests,1845-Polk
within the revenue limit there is a discretion to discriminate beyond that limit the rightful exercise of the power is not conceded,1845-Polk
the incidental protection afforded to our home interests by discriminations within the revenue range it is believed will be ample,1845-Polk
in making discriminations all our home interests should as far as practicable be equally protected,1845-Polk
the largest portion of our people are agriculturists,1845-Polk
others are employed in manufactures commerce navigation and the mechanic arts,1845-Polk
they are all engaged in their respective pursuits and their joint labors constitute the national or home industry,1845-Polk
to tax one branch of this home industry for the benefit of another would be unjust,1845-Polk
no one of these interests can rightfully claim an advantage over the others or to be enriched by impoverishing the others,1845-Polk
all are equally entitled to the fostering care and protection of the government,1845-Polk
in exercising a sound discretion in levying discriminating duties within the limit prescribed care should be taken that it be done in a manner not to benefit the wealthy few at the expense of the toiling millions by taxing lowest the luxuries of life or articles of superior quality and high price which can only be consumed by the wealthy and highest the necessaries of life or articles of coarse quality and low price which the poor and great mass of our people must consume,1845-Polk
the burdens of government should as far as practicable be distributed justly and equally among all classes of our population,1845-Polk
these general views long entertained on this subject i have deemed it proper to reiterate,1845-Polk
it is a subject upon which conflicting interests of sections and occupations are supposed to exist and a spirit of mutual concession and compromise in adjusting its details should be cherished by every part of our widespread country as the only means of preserving harmony and a cheerful acquiescence of all in the operation of our revenue laws,1845-Polk
our patriotic citizens in every part of the union will readily submit to the payment of such taxes as shall be needed for the support of their government whether in peace or in war if they are so levied as to distribute the burdens as equally as possible among them,1845-Polk
the republic of texas has made known her desire to come into our union to form a part of our confederacy and enjoy with us the blessings of liberty secured and guaranteed by our constitution,1845-Polk
texas was once a part of our country was unwisely ceded away to a foreign power is now independent and possesses an undoubted right to dispose of a part or the whole of her territory and to merge her sovereignty as a separate and independent state in ours,1845-Polk
i congratulate my country that by an act of the late congress of the united states the assent of this government has been given to the reunion and it only remains for the two countries to agree upon the terms to consummate an object so important to both,1845-Polk
i regard the question of annexation as belonging exclusively to the united states and texas,1845-Polk
they are independent powers competent to contract and foreign nations have no right to interfere with them or to take exceptions to their reunion,1845-Polk
foreign powers do not seem to appreciate the true character of our government,1845-Polk
our union is confederation of independent states whose policy is peace with each other and all the world,1845-Polk
to enlarge its limits is to extend the dominions of peace over additional territories and increasing millions,1845-Polk
the world has nothing to fear from military ambition in our government,1845-Polk
while the chief magistrate and the popular branch of congress are elected for short terms by the suffrages of those millions who must in their own persons bear all the burdens and miseries of war our government can not be otherwise than pacific,1845-Polk
foreign powers should therefore look on the annexation of texas to the united states not as the conquest of a nation seeking to extend her dominions by arms and violence but as the peaceful acquisition of a territory once her own by adding another member to our confederation with the consent of that member thereby diminishing the chances of war and opening to them new and ever increasing markets for their products,1845-Polk
to texas the reunion is important because the strong protecting arm of our government would be extended over her and the vast resources of her fertile soil and genial climate would be speedily developed while the safety of new orleans and of our whole southwestern frontier against hostile aggression as well as the interests of the whole union would be promoted by it,1845-Polk
in the earlier stages of our national existence the opinion prevailed with some that our system of confederated states could not operate successfully over an extended territory and serious objections have at different times been made to the enlargement of our boundaries,1845-Polk
these objections were earnestly urged when we acquired louisiana,1845-Polk
experience has shown that they were not well founded,1845-Polk
the title of numerous indian tribes to vast tracts of country has been extinguished new states have been admitted into the union new territories have been created and our jurisdiction and laws extended over them,1845-Polk
as our population has expanded the union has been cemented and strengthened,1845-Polk
as our boundaries have been enlarged and our agricultural population has been spread over a large surface our federative system has acquired additional strength and security,1845-Polk
it may well be doubted whether it would not be in greater danger of overthrow if our present population were confined to the comparatively narrow limits of the original thirteen states than it is now that they are sparsely settled over a more expanded territory,1845-Polk
it is confidently believed that our system may be safely extended to the utmost bounds of our territorial limits and that as it shall be extended the bonds of our union so far from being weakened will become stronger,1845-Polk
none can fail to see the danger to our safety and future peace if texas remains an independent state or becomes an ally or dependency of some foreign nation more powerful than herself,1845-Polk
is there one among our citizens who would not prefer perpetual peace with texas to occasional wars which so often occur between bordering independent nations,1845-Polk
is there one who would not prefer free intercourse with her to high duties on all our products and manufactures which enter her ports or cross her frontiers,1845-Polk
is there one who would not prefer an unrestricted communication with her citizens to the frontier obstructions which must occur if she remains out of the union,1845-Polk
whatever is good or evil in the local institutions of texas will remain her own whether annexed to the united states or not,1845-Polk
none of the present states will be responsible for them any more than they are for the local institutions of each other,1845-Polk
they have confederated together for certain specified objects,1845-Polk
upon the same principle that they would refuse to form a perpetual union with texas because of her local institutions our forefathers would have been prevented from forming our present union,1845-Polk
perceiving no valid objection to the measure and many reasons for its adoption vitally affecting the peace the safety and the prosperity of both countries i shall on the broad principle which formed the basis and produced the adoption of our constitution and not in any narrow spirit of sectional policy endeavor by all constitutional honorable and appropriate means to consummate the expressed will of the people and government of the united states by the reannexation of texas to our union at the earliest practicable period,1845-Polk
nor will it become in a less degree my duty to assert and maintain by all constitutional means the right of the united states to that portion of our territory which lies beyond the rocky mountains,1845-Polk
our title to the country of the oregon is clear and unquestionable and already are our people preparing to perfect that title by occupying it with their wives and children,1845-Polk
but eighty years ago our population was confined on the west by the ridge of the alleghanies,1845-Polk
within that period within the lifetime i might say of some of my hearers our people increasing to many millions have filled the eastern valley of the mississippi adventurously ascended the missouri to its headsprings and are already engaged in establishing the blessings of self government in valleys of which the rivers flow to the pacific,1845-Polk
the world beholds the peaceful triumphs of the industry of our emigrants,1845-Polk
to us belongs the duty of protecting them adequately wherever they may be upon our soil,1845-Polk
the jurisdiction of our laws and the benefits of our republican institutions should be extended over them in the distant regions which they have selected for their homes,1845-Polk
the increasing facilities of intercourse will easily bring the states of which the formation in that part of our territory can not be long delayed within the sphere of our federative union,1845-Polk
in the meantime every obligation imposed by treaty or conventional stipulations should be sacredly respected,1845-Polk
in the management of our foreign relations it will be my aim to observe a careful respect for the rights of other nations while our own will be the subject of constant watchfulness,1845-Polk
equal and exact justice should characterize all our intercourse with foreign countries,1845-Polk
all alliances having a tendency to jeopard the welfare and honor of our country or sacrifice any one of the national interests will be studiously avoided and yet no opportunity will be lost to cultivate a favorable understanding with foreign governments by which our navigation and commerce may be extended and the ample products of our fertile soil as well as the manufactures of our skillful artisans find a ready market and remunerating prices in foreign countries,1845-Polk
in taking care that the laws be faithfully executed a strict performance of duty will be exacted from all public officers,1845-Polk
from those officers especially who are charged with the collection and disbursement of the public revenue will prompt and rigid accountability be required,1845-Polk
any culpable failure or delay on their part to account for the moneys intrusted to them at the times and in the manner required by law will in every instance terminate the official connection of such defaulting officer with the government,1845-Polk
although in our country the chief magistrate must almost of necessity be chosen by a party and stand pledged to its principles and measures yet in his official action he should not be the president of a part only but of the whole people of the united states,1845-Polk
while he executes the laws with an impartial hand shrinks from no proper responsibility and faithfully carries out in the executive department of the government the principles and policy of those who have chosen him he should not be unmindful that our fellow citizens who have differed with him in opinion are entitled to the full and free exercise of their opinions and judgments and that the rights of all are entitled to respect and regard,1845-Polk
confidently relying upon the aid and assistance of the coordinate departments of the government in conducting our public affairs i enter upon the discharge of the high duties which have been assigned me by the people again humbly supplicating that divine being who has watched over and protected our beloved country from its infancy to the present hour to continue his gracious benedictions upon us that we may continue to be a prosperous and happy people,1845-Polk
elected by the american people to the highest office known to our laws i appear here to take the oath prescribed by the constitution and in compliance with a time honored custom to address those who are now assembled,1849-Taylor
the confidence and respect shown by my countrymen in calling me to be the chief magistrate of a republic holding a high rank among the nations of the earth have inspired me with feelings of the most profound gratitude but when i reflect that the acceptance of the office which their partiality has bestowed imposes the discharge of the most arduous duties and involves the weightiest obligations i am conscious that the position which i have been called to fill though sufficient to satisfy the loftiest ambition is surrounded by fearful responsibilities,1849-Taylor
happily however in the performance of my new duties i shall not be without able cooperation,1849-Taylor
the legislative and judicial branches of the government present prominent examples of distinguished civil attainments and matured experience and it shall be my endeavor to call to my assistance in the executive departments individuals whose talents integrity and purity of character will furnish ample guaranties for the faithful and honorable performance of the trusts to be committed to their charge,1849-Taylor
with such aids and an honest purpose to do whatever is right i hope to execute diligently impartially and for the best interests of the country the manifold duties devolved upon me,1849-Taylor
in the discharge of these duties my guide will be the constitution which i this day swear to preserve protect and defend,1849-Taylor
for the interpretation of that instrument i shall look to the decisions of the judicial tribunals established by its authority and to the practice of the government under the earlier presidents who had so large a share in its formation,1849-Taylor
to the example of those illustrious patriots i shall always defer with reverence and especially to his example who was by so many titles the father of his country,1849-Taylor
to command the army and navy of the united states with the advice and consent of the senate to make treaties and to appoint ambassadors and other officers to give to congress information of the state of the union and recommend such measures as he shall judge to be necessary and to take care that the laws shall be faithfully executed these are the most important functions intrusted to the president by the constitution and it may be expected that i shall briefly indicate the principles which will control me in their execution,1849-Taylor
chosen by the body of the people under the assurance that my administration would be devoted to the welfare of the whole country and not to the support of any particular section or merely local interest i this day renew the declarations i have heretofore made and proclaim my fixed determination to maintain to the extent of my ability the government in its original purity and to adopt as the basis of my public policy those great republican doctrines which constitute the strength of our national existence,1849-Taylor
in reference to the army and navy lately employed with so much distinction on active service care shall be taken to insure the highest condition of efficiency and in furtherance of that object the military and naval schools sustained by the liberality of congress shall receive the special attention of the executive,1849-Taylor
as american freemen we can not but sympathize in all efforts to extend the blessings of civil and political liberty but at the same time we are warned by the admonitions of history and the voice of our own beloved washington to abstain from entangling alliances with foreign nations,1849-Taylor
in all disputes between conflicting governments it is our interest not less than our duty to remain strictly neutral while our geographical position the genius of our institutions and our people the advancing spirit of civilization and above all the dictates of religion direct us to the cultivation of peaceful and friendly relations with all other powers,1849-Taylor
it is to be hoped that no international question can now arise which a government confident in its own strength and resolved to protect its own just rights may not settle by wise negotiation and it eminently becomes a government like our own founded on the morality and intelligence of its citizens and upheld by their affections to exhaust every resort of honorable diplomacy before appealing to arms,1849-Taylor
in the conduct of our foreign relations i shall conform to these views as i believe them essential to the best interests and the true honor of the country,1849-Taylor
the appointing power vested in the president imposes delicate and onerous duties,1849-Taylor
so far as it is possible to be informed i shall make honesty capacity and fidelity indispensable prerequisites to the bestowal of office and the absence of either of these qualities shall be deemed sufficient cause for removal,1849-Taylor
it shall be my study to recommend such constitutional measures to congress as may be necessary and proper to secure encouragement and protection to the great interests of agriculture commerce and manufactures to improve our rivers and harbors to provide for the speedy extinguishment of the public debt to enforce a strict accountability on the part of all officers of the government and the utmost economy in all public expenditures but it is for the wisdom of congress itself in which all legislative powers are vested by the constitution to regulate these and other matters of domestic policy,1849-Taylor
i shall look with confidence to the enlightened patriotism of that body to adopt such measures of conciliation as may harmonize conflicting interests and tend to perpetuate that union which should be the paramount object of our hopes and affections,1849-Taylor
in any action calculated to promote an object so near the heart of everyone who truly loves his country i will zealously unite with the coordinate branches of the government,1849-Taylor
in conclusion i congratulate you my fellow citizens upon the high state of prosperity to which the goodness of divine providence has conducted our common country,1849-Taylor
let us invoke a continuance of the same protecting care which has led us from small beginnings to the eminence we this day occupy and let us seek to deserve that continuance by prudence and moderation in our councils by well directed attempts to assuage the bitterness which too often marks unavoidable differences of opinion by the promulgation and practice of just and liberal principles and by an enlarged patriotism which shall acknowledge no limits but those of our own widespread republic,1849-Taylor
my countrymen it a relief to feel that no heart but my own can know the personal regret and bitter sorrow over which i have been borne to a position so suitable for others rather than desirable for myself,1853-Pierce
the circumstances under which i have been called for a limited period to preside over the destinies of the republic fill me with a profound sense of responsibility but with nothing like shrinking apprehension,1853-Pierce
i repair to the post assigned me not as to one sought but in obedience to the unsolicited expression of your will answerable only for a fearless faithful and diligent exercise of my best powers,1853-Pierce
i ought to be and am truly grateful for the rare manifestation of the nation s confidence but this so far from lightening my obligations only adds to their weight,1853-Pierce
you have summoned me in my weakness you must sustain me by your strength,1853-Pierce
when looking for the fulfillment of reasonable requirements you will not be unmindful of the great changes which have occurred even within the last quarter of a century and the consequent augmentation and complexity of duties imposed in the administration both of your home and foreign affairs,1853-Pierce
whether the elements of inherent force in the republic have kept pace with its unparalleled progression in territory population and wealth has been the subject of earnest thought and discussion on both sides of the ocean,1853-Pierce
less than sixty four years ago the father of his country made the then recent accession of the important state of north carolina to the constitution of the united states one of the subjects of his special congratulation,1853-Pierce
at that moment however when the agitation consequent upon the revolutionary struggle had hardly subsided when we were just emerging from the weakness and embarrassments of the confederation there was an evident consciousness of vigor equal to the great mission so wisely and bravely fulfilled by our fathers,1853-Pierce
it was not a presumptuous assurance but a calm faith springing from a clear view of the sources of power in a government constituted like ours,1853-Pierce
it is no paradox to say that although comparatively weak the new born nation was intrinsically strong,1853-Pierce
inconsiderable in population and apparent resources it was upheld by a broad and intelligent comprehension of rights and an all pervading purpose to maintain them stronger than armaments,1853-Pierce
it came from the furnace of the revolution tempered to the necessities of the times,1853-Pierce
the thoughts of the men of that day were as practical as their sentiments were patriotic,1853-Pierce
they wasted no portion of their energies upon idle and delusive speculations but with a firm and fearless step advanced beyond the governmental landmarks which had hitherto circumscribed the limits of human freedom and planted their standard where it has stood against dangers which have threatened from abroad and internal agitation which has at times fearfully menaced at home,1853-Pierce
they proved themselves equal to the solution of the great problem to understand which their minds had been illuminated by the dawning lights of the revolution,1853-Pierce
the object sought was not a thing dreamed of it was a thing realized,1853-Pierce
they had exhibited only the power to achieve but what all history affirms to be so much more unusual the capacity to maintain,1853-Pierce
the oppressed throughout the world from that day to the present have turned their eyes hitherward not to find those lights extinguished or to fear lest they should wane but to be constantly cheered by their steady and increasing radiance,1853-Pierce
in this our country has in my judgment thus far fulfilled its highest duty to suffering humanity,1853-Pierce
it has spoken and will continue to speak not only by its words but by its acts the language of sympathy encouragement and hope to those who earnestly listen to tones which pronounce for the largest rational liberty,1853-Pierce
but after all the most animating encouragement and potent appeal for freedom will be its own history its trials and its triumphs,1853-Pierce
preeminently the power of our advocacy reposes in our example but no example be it remembered can be powerful for lasting good whatever apparent advantages may be gained which is not based upon eternal principles of right and justice,1853-Pierce
our fathers decided for themselves both upon the hour to declare and the hour to strike,1853-Pierce
they were their own judges of the circumstances under which it became them to pledge to each other their lives their fortunes and their sacred honor for the acquisition of the priceless inheritance transmitted to us,1853-Pierce
the energy with which that great conflict was opened and under the guidance of a manifest and beneficent providence the uncomplaining endurance with which it was prosecuted to its consummation were only surpassed by the wisdom and patriotic spirit of concession which characterized all the counsels of the early fathers,1853-Pierce
one of the most impressive evidences of that wisdom is to be found in the fact that the actual working of our system has dispelled a degree of solicitude which at the outset disturbed bold hearts and far reaching intellects,1853-Pierce
the apprehension of dangers from extended territory multiplied states accumulated wealth and augmented population has proved to be unfounded,1853-Pierce
the stars upon your banner have become nearly threefold their original number your densely populated possessions skirt the shores of the two great oceans and yet this vast increase of people and territory has not only shown itself compatible with the harmonious action of the states and federal government in their respective constitutional spheres but has afforded an additional guaranty of the strength and integrity of both,1853-Pierce
with an experience thus suggestive and cheering the policy of my administration will not be controlled by any timid forebodings of evil from expansion,1853-Pierce
indeed it is not to be disguised that our attitude as a nation and our position on the globe render the acquisition of certain possessions not within our jurisdiction eminently important for our protection if not in the future essential for the preservation of the rights of commerce and the peace of the world,1853-Pierce
should they be obtained it will be through no grasping spirit but with a view to obvious national interest and security and in a manner entirely consistent with the strictest observance of national faith,1853-Pierce
we have nothing in our history or position to invite aggression we have everything to beckon us to the cultivation of relations of peace and amity with all nations,1853-Pierce
purposes therefore at once just and pacific will be significantly marked in the conduct of our foreign affairs,1853-Pierce
i intend that my administration shall leave no blot upon our fair record and trust i may safely give the assurance that no act within the legitimate scope of my constitutional control will be tolerated on the part of any portion of our citizens which can not challenge a ready justification before the tribunal of the civilized world,1853-Pierce
an administration would be unworthy of confidence at home or respect abroad should it cease to be influenced by the conviction that no apparent advantage can be purchased at a price so dear as that of national wrong or dishonor,1853-Pierce
it is not your privilege as a nation to speak of a distant past,1853-Pierce
the striking incidents of your history replete with instruction and furnishing abundant grounds for hopeful confidence are comprised in a period comparatively brief,1853-Pierce
but if your past is limited your future is boundless,1853-Pierce
its obligations throng the unexplored pathway of advancement and will be limitless as duration,1853-Pierce
hence a sound and comprehensive policy should embrace not less the distant future than the urgent present,1853-Pierce
the great objects of our pursuit as a people are best to be attained by peace and are entirely consistent with the tranquillity and interests of the rest of mankind,1853-Pierce
with the neighboring nations upon our continent we should cultivate kindly and fraternal relations,1853-Pierce
we can desire nothing in regard to them so much as to see them consolidate their strength and pursue the paths of prosperity and happiness,1853-Pierce
if in the course of their growth we should open new channels of trade and create additional facilities for friendly intercourse the benefits realized will be equal and mutual,1853-Pierce
of the complicated european systems of national polity we have heretofore been independent,1853-Pierce
from their wars their tumults and anxieties we have been happily almost entirely exempt,1853-Pierce
whilst these are confined to the nations which gave them existence and within their legitimate jurisdiction they can not affect us except as they appeal to our sympathies in the cause of human freedom and universal advancement,1853-Pierce
but the vast interests of commerce are common to all mankind and the advantages of trade and international intercourse must always present a noble field for the moral influence of a great people,1853-Pierce
with these views firmly and honestly carried out we have a right to expect and shall under all circumstances require prompt reciprocity,1853-Pierce
the rights which belong to us as a nation are not alone to be regarded but those which pertain to every citizen in his individual capacity at home and abroad must be sacredly maintained,1853-Pierce
so long as he can discern every star in its place upon that ensign without wealth to purchase for him preferment or title to secure for him place it will be his privilege and must be his acknowledged right to stand unabashed even in the presence of princes with a proud consciousness that he is himself one of a nation of sovereigns and that he can not in legitimate pursuit wander so far from home that the agent whom he shall leave behind in the place which i now occupy will not see that no rude hand of power or tyrannical passion is laid upon him with impunity,1853-Pierce
he must realize that upon every sea and on every soil where our enterprise may rightfully seek the protection of our flag american citizenship is an inviolable panoply for the security of american rights,1853-Pierce
and in this connection it can hardly be necessary to reaffirm a principle which should now be regarded as fundamental,1853-Pierce
the rights security and repose of this confederacy reject the idea of interference or colonization on this side of the ocean by any foreign power beyond present jurisdiction as utterly inadmissible,1853-Pierce
the opportunities of observation furnished by my brief experience as a soldier confirmed in my own mind the opinion entertained and acted upon by others from the formation of the government that the maintenance of large standing armies in our country would be not only dangerous but unnecessary,1853-Pierce
they also illustrated the importance i might well say the absolute necessity of the military science and practical skill furnished in such an eminent degree by the institution which has made your army what it is under the discipline and instruction of officers not more distinguished for their solid attainments gallantry and devotion to the public service than for unobtrusive bearing and high moral tone,1853-Pierce
the army as organized must be the nucleus around which in every time of need the strength of your military power the sure bulwark of your defense a national militia may be readily formed into a well disciplined and efficient organization,1853-Pierce
and the skill and self devotion of the navy assure you that you may take the performance of the past as a pledge for the future and may confidently expect that the flag which has waved its untarnished folds over every sea will still float in undiminished honor,1853-Pierce
but these like many other subjects will be appropriately brought at a future time to the attention of the coordinate branches of the government to which i shall always look with profound respect and with trustful confidence that they will accord to me the aid and support which i shall so much need and which their experience and wisdom will readily suggest,1853-Pierce
in the administration of domestic affairs you expect a devoted integrity in the public service and an observance of rigid economy in all departments so marked as never justly to be questioned,1853-Pierce
if this reasonable expectation be not realized i frankly confess that one of your leading hopes is doomed to disappointment and that my efforts in a very important particular must result in a humiliating failure,1853-Pierce
offices can be properly regarded only in the light of aids for the accomplishment of these objects and as occupancy can confer no prerogative nor importunate desire for preferment any claim the public interest imperatively demands that they be considered with sole reference to the duties to be performed,1853-Pierce
good citizens may well claim the protection of good laws and the benign influence of good government but a claim for office is what the people of a republic should never recognize,1853-Pierce
no reasonable man of any party will expect the administration to be so regardless of its responsibility and of the obvious elements of success as to retain persons known to be under the influence of political hostility and partisan prejudice in positions which will require not only severe labor but cordial cooperation,1853-Pierce
having no implied engagements to ratify no rewards to bestow no resentments to remember and no personal wishes to consult in selections for official station i shall fulfill this difficult and delicate trust admitting no motive as worthy either of my character or position which does not contemplate an efficient discharge of duty and the best interests of my country,1853-Pierce
i acknowledge my obligations to the masses of my countrymen and to them alone,1853-Pierce
higher objects than personal aggrandizement gave direction and energy to their exertions in the late canvass and they shall not be disappointed,1853-Pierce
they require at my hands diligence integrity and capacity wherever there are duties to be performed,1853-Pierce
without these qualities in their public servants more stringent laws for the prevention or punishment of fraud negligence and peculation will be vain,1853-Pierce
with them they will be unnecessary,1853-Pierce
but these are not the only points to which you look for vigilant watchfulness,1853-Pierce
the dangers of a concentration of all power in the general government of a confederacy so vast as ours are too obvious to be disregarded,1853-Pierce
you have a right therefore to expect your agents in every department to regard strictly the limits imposed upon them by the constitution of the united states,1853-Pierce
the great scheme of our constitutional liberty rests upon a proper distribution of power between the state and federal authorities and experience has shown that the harmony and happiness of our people must depend upon a just discrimination between the separate rights and responsibilities of the states and your common rights and obligations under the general government and here in my opinion are the considerations which should form the true basis of future concord in regard to the questions which have most seriously disturbed public tranquillity,1853-Pierce
if the federal government will confine itself to the exercise of powers clearly granted by the constitution it can hardly happen that its action upon any question should endanger the institutions of the states or interfere with their right to manage matters strictly domestic according to the will of their own people,1853-Pierce
in expressing briefly my views upon an important subject rich has recently agitated the nation to almost a fearful degree i am moved by no other impulse than a most earnest desire for the perpetuation of that union which has made us what we are showering upon us blessings and conferring a power and influence which our fathers could hardly have anticipated even with their most sanguine hopes directed to a far off future,1853-Pierce
the sentiments i now announce were not unknown before the expression of the voice which called me here,1853-Pierce
my own position upon this subject was clear and unequivocal upon the record of my words and my acts and it is only recurred to at this time because silence might perhaps be misconstrued,1853-Pierce
with the union my best and dearest earthly hopes are entwined,1853-Pierce
without it what are we individually or collectively,1853-Pierce
what becomes of the noblest field ever opened for the advancement of our race in religion in government in the arts and in all that dignifies and adorns mankind,1853-Pierce
from that radiant constellation which both illumines our own way and points out to struggling nations their course let but a single star be lost and if these be not utter darkness the luster of the whole is dimmed,1853-Pierce
do my countrymen need any assurance that such a catastrophe is not to overtake them while i possess the power to stay it,1853-Pierce
it is with me an earnest and vital belief that as the union has been the source under providence of our prosperity to this time so it is the surest pledge of a continuance of the blessings we have enjoyed and which we are sacredly bound to transmit undiminished to our children,1853-Pierce
the field of calm and free discussion in our country is open and will always be so but never has been and never can be traversed for good in a spirit of sectionalism and uncharitableness,1853-Pierce
the founders of the republic dealt with things as they were presented to them in a spirit of self sacrificing patriotism and as time has proved with a comprehensive wisdom which it will always be safe for us to consult,1853-Pierce
every measure tending to strengthen the fraternal feelings of all the members of our union has had my heartfelt approbation,1853-Pierce
to every theory of society or government whether the offspring of feverish ambition or of morbid enthusiasm calculated to dissolve the bonds of law and affection which unite us i shall interpose a ready and stern resistance,1853-Pierce
i believe that involuntary servitude as it exists in different states of this confederacy is recognized by the constitution,1853-Pierce
i believe that it stands like any other admitted right and that the states where it exists are entitled to efficient remedies to enforce the constitutional provisions,1853-Pierce
i hold that the laws of 1850 commonly called the compromise measures are strictly constitutional and to be unhesitatingly carried into effect,1853-Pierce
i believe that the constituted authorities of this republic are bound to regard the rights of the south in this respect as they would view any other legal and constitutional right and that the laws to enforce them should be respected and obeyed not with a reluctance encouraged by abstract opinions as to their propriety in a different state of society but cheerfully and according to the decisions of the tribunal to which their exposition belongs,1853-Pierce
such have been and are my convictions and upon them i shall act,1853-Pierce
i fervently hope that the question is at rest and that no sectional or ambitious or fanatical excitement may again threaten the durability of our institutions or obscure the light of our prosperity,1853-Pierce
but let not the foundation of our hope rest upon man s wisdom,1853-Pierce
it will not be sufficient that sectional prejudices find no place in the public deliberations,1853-Pierce
it will not be sufficient that the rash counsels of human passion are rejected,1853-Pierce
it must be felt that there is no national security but in the nation s humble acknowledged dependence upon god and his overruling providence,1853-Pierce
we have been carried in safety through a perilous crisis,1853-Pierce
wise counsels like those which gave us the constitution prevailed to uphold it,1853-Pierce
let the period be remembered as an admonition and not as an encouragement in any section of the union to make experiments where experiments are fraught with such fearful hazard,1853-Pierce
let it be impressed upon all hearts that beautiful as our fabric is no earthly power or wisdom could ever reunite its broken fragments,1853-Pierce
standing as i do almost within view of the green slopes of monticello and as it were within reach of the tomb of washington with all the cherished memories of the past gathering around me like so many eloquent voices of exhortation from heaven i can express no better hope for my country than that the kind providence which smiled upon our fathers may enable their children to preserve the blessings they have inherited,1853-Pierce
fellow citizens i appear before you this day to take the solemn oath that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states,1857-Buchanan
in entering upon this great office i must humbly invoke the god of our fathers for wisdom and firmness to execute its high and responsible duties in such a manner as to restore harmony and ancient friendship among the people of the several states and to preserve our free institutions throughout many generations,1857-Buchanan
convinced that i owe my election to the inherent love for the constitution and the union which still animates the hearts of the american people let me earnestly ask their powerful support in sustaining all just measures calculated to perpetuate these the richest political blessings which heaven has ever bestowed upon any nation,1857-Buchanan
having determined not to become a candidate for reelection i shall have no motive to influence my conduct in administering the government except the desire ably and faithfull to serve my country and to live in grateful memory of my countrymen,1857-Buchanan
we have recently passed through a presidential contest in which the passions of our fellow citizens were excited to the highest degree by questions of deep and vital importance but when the people proclaimed their will the tempest at once subsided and all was calm,1857-Buchanan
the voice of the majority speaking in the manner prescribed by the constitution was heard and instant submission followed,1857-Buchanan
our own country could alone have exhibited so grand and striking a spectacle of the capacity of man for self government,1857-Buchanan
what a happy conception then was it for congress to apply this simple rule that the will of the majority shall govern to the settlement of the question of domestic slavery in the territories,1857-Buchanan
congress is neither to legislate slavery into any territory or state nor to exclude it therefrom but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way subject only to the constitution of the united states,1857-Buchanan
as a natural consequence congress has also prescribed that when the territory of kansas shall be admitted as a state it shall be received into the union with or without slavery as their constitution may prescribe at the time of their admission,1857-Buchanan
a difference of opinion has arisen in regard to the point of time when the people of a territory shall decide this question for themselves,1857-Buchanan
this is happily a matter of but little practical importance,1857-Buchanan
besides it is a judicial question which legitimately belongs to the supreme court of the united states before whom it is now pending and will it is understood be speedily and finally settled,1857-Buchanan
to their decision in common with all good citizens i shall cheerfully submit whatever this may be though it has ever been my individual opinion that under the nebraska kansas act the appropriate period will be when the number of actual residents in the territory shall justify the formation of a constitution with a view to its admission as a state into the union,1857-Buchanan
but be this as it may it is the imperative and indispensable duty of the government of the united states to secure to every resident inhabitant the free and independent expression of his opinion by his vote,1857-Buchanan
this sacred right of each individual must be preserved,1857-Buchanan
that being accomplished nothing can be fairer than to leave the people of a territory free from all foreign interference to decide their own destiny for themselves subject only to the constitution of the united states,1857-Buchanan
the whole territorial question being thus settled upon the principle of popular sovereignty a principle as ancient as free government itself everything of a practical nature has been decided,1857-Buchanan
no other question remains for adjustment because all agree that under the constitution slavery in the states is beyond the reach of any human power except that of the respective states themselves wherein it exists,1857-Buchanan
may we not then hope that the long agitation on this subject is approaching its end and that the geographical parties to which it has given birth so much dreaded by the father of his country will speedily become extinct,1857-Buchanan
most happy will it be for the country when the public mind shall be diverted from this question to others of more pressing and practical importance,1857-Buchanan
throughout the whole progress of this agitation which has scarcely known any intermission for more than twenty years whilst it has been productive of no positive good to any human being it has been the prolific source of great evils to the master to the slave and to the whole country,1857-Buchanan
it has alienated and estranged the people of the sister states from each other and has even seriously endangered the very existence of the union,1857-Buchanan
nor has the danger yet entirely ceased,1857-Buchanan
under our system there is a remedy for all mere political evils in the sound sense and sober judgment of the people,1857-Buchanan
time is a great corrective,1857-Buchanan
political subjects which but a few years ago excited and exasperated the public mind have passed away and are now nearly forgotten,1857-Buchanan
but this question of domestic slavery is of far graver importance than any mere political question because should the agitation continue it may eventually endanger the personal safety of a large portion of our countrymen where the institution exists,1857-Buchanan
in that event no form of government however admirable in itself and however productive of material benefits can compensate for the loss of peace and domestic security around the family altar,1857-Buchanan
let every union loving man therefore exert his best influence to suppress this agitation which since the recent legislation of congress is without any legitimate object,1857-Buchanan
it is an evil omen of the times that men have undertaken to calculate the mere material value of the union,1857-Buchanan
reasoned estimates have been presented of the pecuniary profits and local advantages which would result to different states and sections from its dissolution and of the comparative injuries which such an event would inflict on other states and sections,1857-Buchanan
even descending to this low and narrow view of the mighty question all such calculations are at fault,1857-Buchanan
the bare reference to a single consideration will be conclusive on this point,1857-Buchanan
we at present enjoy a free trade throughout our extensive and expanding country such as the world has never witnessed,1857-Buchanan
this trade is conducted on railroads and canals on noble rivers and arms of the sea which bind together the north and the south the east and the west of our confederacy,1857-Buchanan
annihilate this trade arrest its free progress by the geographical lines of jealous and hostile states and you destroy the prosperity and onward march of the whole and every part and involve all in one common ruin,1857-Buchanan
but such considerations important as they are in themselves sink into insignificance when we reflect on the terrific evils which would result from disunion to every portion of the confederacy to the north not more than to the south to the east not more than to the west,1857-Buchanan
these i shall not attempt to portray because i feel an humble confidence that the kind providence which inspired our fathers with wisdom to frame the most perfect form of government and union ever devised by man will not suffer it to perish until it shall have been peacefully instrumental by its example in the extension of civil and religious liberty throughout the world,1857-Buchanan
next in importance to the maintenance of the constitution and the union is the duty of preserving the government free from the taint or even the suspicion of corruption,1857-Buchanan
public virtue is the vital spirit of republics and history proves that when this has decayed and the love of money has usurped its place although the forms of free government may remain for a season the substance has departed forever,1857-Buchanan
our present financial condition is without a parallel in history,1857-Buchanan
no nation has ever before been embarrassed from too large a surplus in its treasury,1857-Buchanan
this almost necessarily gives birth to extravagant legislation,1857-Buchanan
it produces wild schemes of expenditure and begets a race of speculators and jobbers whose ingenuity is exerted in contriving and promoting expedients to obtain public money,1857-Buchanan
the purity of official agents whether rightfully or wrongfully is suspected and the character of the government suffers in the estimation of the people,1857-Buchanan
this is in itself a very great evil,1857-Buchanan
the natural mode of relief from this embarrassment is to appropriate the surplus in the treasury to great national objects for which a clear warrant can be found in the constitution,1857-Buchanan
among these i might mention the extinguishment of the public debt a reasonable increase of the navy which is at present inadequate to the protection of our vast tonnage afloat now greater than that of any other nation as well as to the defense of our extended seacoast,1857-Buchanan
it is beyond all question the true principle that no more revenue ought to be collected from the people than the amount necessary to defray the expenses of a wise economical and efficient administration of the government,1857-Buchanan
to reach this point it was necessary to resort to a modification of the tariff and this has i trust been accomplished in such a manner as to do as little injury as may have been practicable to our domestic manufactures especially those necessary for the defense of the country,1857-Buchanan
any discrimination against a particular branch for the purpose of benefiting favored corporations individuals or interests would have been unjust to the rest of the community and inconsistent with that spirit of fairness and equality which ought to govern in the adjustment of a revenue tariff,1857-Buchanan
but the squandering of the public money sinks into comparative insignificance as a temptation to corruption when compared with the squandering of the public lands,1857-Buchanan
no nation in the tide of time has ever been blessed with so rich and noble an inheritance as we enjoy in the public lands,1857-Buchanan
in administering this important trust whilst it may be wise to grant portions of them for the improvement of the remainder yet we should never forget that it is our cardinal policy to reserve these lands as much as may be for actual settlers and this at moderate prices,1857-Buchanan
we shall thus not only best promote the prosperity of the new states and territories by furnishing them a hardy and independent race of honest and industrious citizens but shall secure homes for our children and our children s children as well as for those exiles from foreign shores who may seek in this country to improve their condition and to enjoy the blessings of civil and religious liberty,1857-Buchanan
such emigrants have done much to promote the growth and prosperity of the country,1857-Buchanan
they have proved faithful both in peace and in war,1857-Buchanan
after becoming citizens they are entitled under the constitution and laws to be placed on a perfect equality with native born citizens and in this character they should ever be kindly recognized,1857-Buchanan
the federal constitution is a grant from the states to congress of certain specific powers and the question whether this grant should be liberally or strictly construed has more or less divided political parties from the beginning,1857-Buchanan
without entering into the argument i desire to state at the commencement of my administration that long experience and observation have convinced me that a strict construction of the powers of the government i the only true as well as the only safe theory of the constitution,1857-Buchanan
whenever in our past history doubtful powers have been exercised by congress these have never failed to produce injurious and unhappy consequences,1857-Buchanan
many such instances might be adduced if this were the proper occasion,1857-Buchanan
neither is it necessary for the public service to strain the language of the constitution because all the great and useful powers required for a successful administration of the government both in peace and in war have been granted either in express terms or by the plainest implication,1857-Buchanan
whilst deeply convinced of these truths i yet consider it clear that under the war making power congress may appropriate money toward the construction of a military road when this is absolutely necessary for the defense of any state or territory of the union against foreign invasion,1857-Buchanan
under the constitution congress has power to declare war to raise and support armies to provide and maintain a navy and to call forth the militia to repel invasions,1857-Buchanan
thus endowed in an ample manner with the war making power the corresponding duty is required that the united states shall protect each of them the states against invasion,1857-Buchanan
now how is it possible to afford this protection to california and our pacific possessions except by means of a military road through the territories of the united states over which men and munitions of war may be speedily transported from the atlantic states to meet and to repel the invader,1857-Buchanan
in the event of a war with a naval power much stronger than our own we should then have no other available access to the pacific coast because such a power would instantly close the route across the isthmus of central america,1857-Buchanan
it is impossible to conceive that whilst the constitution has expressly required congress to defend all the states it should yet deny to them by any fair construction the only possible means by which one of these states can be defended,1857-Buchanan
besides the government ever since its origin has been in the constant practice of constructing military roads,1857-Buchanan
it might also be wise to consider whether the love for the union which now animates our fellow citizens on the pacific coast may not be impaired by our neglect or refusal to provide for them in their remote and isolated condition the only means by which the power of the states on this side of the rocky mountains can reach them in sufficient time to protect them against invasion,1857-Buchanan
i forbear for the present from expressing an opinion as to the wisest and most economical mode in which the government can lend its aid in accomplishing this great and necessary work,1857-Buchanan
i believe that many of the difficulties in the way which now appear formidable will in a great degree vanish as soon as the nearest and best route shall have been satisfactorily ascertained,1857-Buchanan
it may be proper that on this occasion i should make some brief remarks in regard to our rights and duties as a member of the great family of nations,1857-Buchanan
in our intercourse with them there are some plain principles approved by our own experience from which we should never depart,1857-Buchanan
we ought to cultivate peace commerce and friendship with all nations and this not merely as the best means of promoting our own material interests but in a spirit of christian benevolence toward our fellow men wherever their lot may be cast,1857-Buchanan
our diplomacy should be direct and frank neither seeking to obtain more nor accepting less than is our due,1857-Buchanan
we ought to cherish a sacred regard for the independence of all nations and never attempt to interfere in the domestic concerns of any unless this shall be imperatively required by the great law of self preservation,1857-Buchanan
to avoid entangling alliances has been a maxim of our policy ever since the days of washington and its wisdom s no one will attempt to dispute,1857-Buchanan
in short we ought to do justice in a kindly spirit to all nations and require justice from them in return,1857-Buchanan
it is our glory that whilst other nations have extended their dominions by the sword we have never acquired any territory except by fair purchase or as in the case of texas by the voluntary determination of a brave kindred and independent people to blend their destinies with our own,1857-Buchanan
even our acquisitions from mexico form no exception,1857-Buchanan
unwilling to take advantage of the fortune of war against a sister republic we purchased these possessions under the treaty of peace for a sum which was considered at the time a fair equivalent,1857-Buchanan
our past history forbids that we shall in the future acquire territory unless this be sanctioned by the laws of justice and honor,1857-Buchanan
acting on this principle no nation will have a right to interfere or to complain if in the progress of events we shall still further extend our possessions,1857-Buchanan
hitherto in all our acquisitions the people under the protection of the american flag have enjoyed civil and religious liberty as well as equal and just laws and have been contented prosperous and happy,1857-Buchanan
their trade with the rest of the world has rapidly increased and thus every commercial nation has shared largely in their successful progress,1857-Buchanan
i shall now proceed to take the oath prescribed by the constitution whilst humbly invoking the blessing of divine providence on this great people,1857-Buchanan
fellow citizens of the united states in compliance with a custom as old as the government itself i appear before you to address you briefly and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the constitution of the united states to be taken by the president before he enters on the execution of this office,1861-Lincoln
i do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement,1861-Lincoln
apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered,1861-Lincoln
there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension,1861-Lincoln
indeed the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection,1861-Lincoln
it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you,1861-Lincoln
i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that,1861-Lincoln
i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists,1861-Lincoln
i believe i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so,1861-Lincoln
those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that i had made this and many similar declarations and had never recanted them and more than this they placed in the platform for my acceptance and as a law to themselves and to me the clear and emphatic resolution which i now read,1861-Lincoln
resolved that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states and especially the right of each state to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any state or territory no matter what pretext as among the gravest of crimes,1861-Lincoln
i now reiterate these sentiments and in doing so i only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible that the property peace and security of no section are to be in any wise endangered by the now incoming administration,1861-Lincoln
i add too that all the protection which consistently with the constitution and the laws can be given will be cheerfully given to all the states when lawfully demanded for whatever cause as cheerfully to one section as to another,1861-Lincoln
there is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor,1861-Lincoln
the clause i now read is as plainly written in the constitution as any other of its provisions,1861-Lincoln
no person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof escaping into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due,1861-Lincoln
it is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves and the intention of the lawgiver is the law,1861-Lincoln
all members of congress swear their support to the whole constitution to this provision as much as to any other,1861-Lincoln
to the proposition then that slaves whose cases come within the terms of this clause shall be delivered up their oaths are unanimous,1861-Lincoln
now if they would make the effort in good temper could they not with nearly equal unanimity frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath,1861-Lincoln
there is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority but surely that difference is not a very material one,1861-Lincoln
if the slave is to be surrendered it can be of but little consequence to him or to others by which authority it is done,1861-Lincoln
and should anyone in any case be content that his oath shall go unkept on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept,1861-Lincoln
again in any law upon this subject ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced so that a free man be not in any case surrendered as a slave,1861-Lincoln
and might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the constitution which guarantees that the citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states,1861-Lincoln
i take the official oath to day with no mental reservations and with no purpose to construe the constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules and while i do not choose now to specify particular acts of congress as proper to be enforced i do suggest that it will be much safer for all both in official and private stations to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed than to violate any of them trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional,1861-Lincoln
it is seventy two years since the first inauguration of a president under our national constitution,1861-Lincoln
during that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have in succession administered the executive branch of the government,1861-Lincoln
they have conducted it through many perils and generally with great success,1861-Lincoln
yet with all this scope of precedent i now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years under great and peculiar difficulty,1861-Lincoln
a disruption of the federal union heretofore only menaced is now formidably attempted,1861-Lincoln
i hold that in contemplation of universal law and of the constitution the union of these states is perpetual,1861-Lincoln
perpetuity is implied if not expressed in the fundamental law of all national governments,1861-Lincoln
it is safe to assert that no government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination,1861-Lincoln
continue to execute all the express provisions of our national constitution and the union will endure forever it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself,1861-Lincoln
again if the united states be not a government proper but an association of states in the nature of contract merely can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it,1861-Lincoln
one party to a contract may violate it break it so to speak but does it not require all to lawfully rescind it,1861-Lincoln
descending from these general principles we find the proposition that in legal contemplation the union is perpetual confirmed by the history of the union itself,1861-Lincoln
the union is much older than the constitution,1861-Lincoln
it was formed in fact by the articles of association in 1774,1861-Lincoln
it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in 1776,1861-Lincoln
it was further matured and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual by the articles of confederation in 1778,1861-Lincoln
and finally in 1787 one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was to form a more perfect union,1861-Lincoln
but if destruction of the union by one or by a part only of the states be lawfully possible the union is less perfect than before the constitution having lost the vital element of perpetuity,1861-Lincoln
it follows from these views that no state upon its own mere motion can lawfully get out of the union that resolves and ordinances to that effect are legally void and that acts of violence within any state or states against the authority of the united states are insurrectionary or revolutionary according to circumstances,1861-Lincoln
i therefore consider that in view of the constitution and the laws the union is unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states,1861-Lincoln
doing this i deem to be only a simple duty on my part and i shall perform it so far as practicable unless my rightful masters the american people shall withhold the requisite means or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary,1861-Lincoln
i trust this will not be regarded as a menace but only as the declared purpose of the union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself,1861-Lincoln
in doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence and there shall be none unless it be forced upon the national authority,1861-Lincoln
the power confided to me will be used to hold occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the government and to collect the duties and imposts but beyond what may be necessary for these objects there will be no invasion no using of force against or among the people anywhere,1861-Lincoln
where hostility to the united states in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object,1861-Lincoln
while the strict legal right may exist in the government to enforce the exercise of these offices the attempt to do so would be so irritating and so nearly impracticable withal that i deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices,1861-Lincoln
the mails unless repelled will continue to be furnished in all parts of the union,1861-Lincoln
so far as possible the people everywhere shall have that sense of perfect security which is most favorable to calm thought and reflection,1861-Lincoln
the course here indicated will be followed unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper and in every case and exigency my best discretion will be exercised according to circumstances actually existing and with a view and a hope of a peaceful solution of the national troubles and the restoration of fraternal sympathies and affections,1861-Lincoln
that there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all events and are glad of any pretext to do it i will neither affirm nor deny but if there be such i need address no word to them,1861-Lincoln
to those however who really love the union may i not speak,1861-Lincoln
before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric with all its benefits its memories and its hopes would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it,1861-Lincoln
will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence,1861-Lincoln
will you while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake,1861-Lincoln
all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained,1861-Lincoln
is it true then that any right plainly written in the constitution has been denied,1861-Lincoln
i think not,1861-Lincoln
happily the human mind is so constituted that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this,1861-Lincoln
think if you can of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the constitution has ever been denied,1861-Lincoln
if by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right it might in a moral point of view justify revolution certainly would if such right were a vital one,1861-Lincoln
but such is not our case,1861-Lincoln
all the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations guaranties and prohibitions in the constitution that controversies never arise concerning them,1861-Lincoln
but no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration,1861-Lincoln
no foresight can anticipate nor any document of reasonable length contain express provisions for all possible questions,1861-Lincoln
shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by state authority,1861-Lincoln
the constitution does not expressly say,1861-Lincoln
may congress prohibit slavery in the territories,1861-Lincoln
the constitution does not expressly say,1861-Lincoln
must congress protect slavery in the territories,1861-Lincoln
the constitution does not expressly say,1861-Lincoln
from questions of this class spring all our constitutional controversies and we divide upon them into majorities and minorities,1861-Lincoln
if the minority will not acquiesce the majority must or the government must cease,1861-Lincoln
there is no other alternative for continuing the government is acquiescence on one side or the other,1861-Lincoln
if a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority,1861-Lincoln
for instance why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again precisely as portions of the present union now claim to secede from it,1861-Lincoln
all who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this,1861-Lincoln
is there such perfect identity of interests among the states to compose a new union as to produce harmony only and prevent renewed secession,1861-Lincoln
plainly the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy,1861-Lincoln
a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people,1861-Lincoln
whoever rejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism,1861-Lincoln
unanimity is impossible,1861-Lincoln
the rule of a minority as a permanent arrangement is wholly inadmissible so that rejecting the majority principle anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left,1861-Lincoln
i do not forget the position assumed by some that constitutional questions are to be decided by the supreme court nor do i deny that such decisions must be binding in any case upon the parties to a suit as to the object of that suit while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the government,1861-Lincoln
and while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case still the evil effect following it being limited to that particular case with the chance that it may be overruled and never become a precedent for other cases can better be borne than could the evils of a different practice,1861-Lincoln
at the same time the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme court the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will have ceased to be their own rulers having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal,1861-Lincoln
nor is there in this view any assault upon the court or the judges,1861-Lincoln
it is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes,1861-Lincoln
one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended,1861-Lincoln
this is the only substantial dispute,1861-Lincoln
the fugitive slave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced perhaps as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself,1861-Lincoln
the great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases and a few break over in each,1861-Lincoln
this i think can not be perfectly cured and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections than before,1861-Lincoln
the foreign slave trade now imperfectly suppressed would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section while fugitive slaves now only partially surrendered would not be surrendered at all by the other,1861-Lincoln
physically speaking we can not separate,1861-Lincoln
we can not remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them,1861-Lincoln
a husband and wife may be divorced and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other but the different parts of our country can not do this,1861-Lincoln
they can not but remain face to face and intercourse either amicable or hostile must continue between them,1861-Lincoln
is it possible then to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before,1861-Lincoln
can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws,1861-Lincoln
can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends,1861-Lincoln
suppose you go to war you can not fight always and when after much loss on both sides and no gain on either you cease fighting the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you,1861-Lincoln
this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it,1861-Lincoln
whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it,1861-Lincoln
i can not be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the national constitution amended,1861-Lincoln
while i make no recommendation of amendments i fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself and i should under existing circumstances favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it,1861-Lincoln
i will venture to add that to me the convention mode seems preferable in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others not especially chosen for the purpose and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse,1861-Lincoln
i understand a proposed amendment to the constitution which amendment however i have not seen has passed congress to the effect that the federal government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the states including that of persons held to service,1861-Lincoln
to avoid misconstruction of what i have said i depart from my purpose not to speak of particular amendments so far as to say that holding such a provision to now be implied constitutional law i have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable,1861-Lincoln
the chief magistrate derives all his authority from the people and they have referred none upon him to fix terms for the separation of the states,1861-Lincoln
the people themselves can do this if also they choose but the executive as such has nothing to do with it,1861-Lincoln
his duty is to administer the present government as it came to his hands and to transmit it unimpaired by him to his successor,1861-Lincoln
why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people,1861-Lincoln
is there any better or equal hope in the world,1861-Lincoln
in our present differences is either party without faith of being in the right,1861-Lincoln
if the almighty ruler of nations with his eternal truth and justice be on your side of the north or on yours of the south that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the american people,1861-Lincoln
by the frame of the government under which we live this same people have wisely given their public servants but little power for mischief and have with equal wisdom provided for the return of that little to their own hands at very short intervals,1861-Lincoln
while the people retain their virtue and vigilance no administration by any extreme of wickedness or folly can very seriously injure the government in the short space of four years,1861-Lincoln
my countrymen one and all think calmly and well upon this whole subject,1861-Lincoln
nothing valuable can be lost by taking time,1861-Lincoln
if there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately that object will be frustrated by taking time but no good object can be frustrated by it,1861-Lincoln
such of you as are now dissatisfied still have the old constitution unimpaired and on the sensitive point the laws of your own framing under it while the new administration will have no immediate power if it would to change either,1861-Lincoln
if it were admitted that you who are dissatisfied hold the right side in the dispute there still is no single good reason for precipitate action,1861-Lincoln
intelligence patriotism christianity and a firm reliance on him who has never yet forsaken this favored land are still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty,1861-Lincoln
in your hands my dissatisfied fellow countrymen and not in mine is the momentous issue of civil war,1861-Lincoln
the government will not assail you,1861-Lincoln
you can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors,1861-Lincoln
you have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the government while i shall have the most solemn one to preserve protect and defend it,1861-Lincoln
i am loath to close,1861-Lincoln
we are not enemies but friends,1861-Lincoln
we must not be enemies,1861-Lincoln
though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection,1861-Lincoln
the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature,1861-Lincoln
fellow countrymen,1865-Lincoln
at this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first,1865-Lincoln
then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper,1865-Lincoln
now at the expiration of four years during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation little that is new could be presented,1865-Lincoln
the progress of our arms upon which all else chiefly depends is as well known to the public as to myself and it is i trust reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all,1865-Lincoln
with high hope for the future no prediction in regard to it is ventured,1865-Lincoln
on the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war,1865-Lincoln
all dreaded it all sought to avert it,1865-Lincoln
while the inaugural address was being delivered from this place devoted altogether to saving the union without war urgent agents were in the city seeking to destroy it without war seeking to dissolve the union and divide effects by negotiation,1865-Lincoln
both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came,1865-Lincoln
one eighth of the whole population were colored slaves not distributed generally over the union but localized in the southern part of it,1865-Lincoln
these slaves constituted a peculiar and powerful interest,1865-Lincoln
all knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war,1865-Lincoln
to strengthen perpetuate and extend this interest was the object for which the insurgents would rend the union even by war while the government claimed no right to do more than to restrict the territorial enlargement of it,1865-Lincoln
neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained,1865-Lincoln
neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease,1865-Lincoln
each looked for an easier triumph and a result less fundamental and astounding,1865-Lincoln
both read the same bible and pray to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other,1865-Lincoln
it may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just god s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men s faces but let us judge not that we be not judged,1865-Lincoln
the prayers of both could not be answered,1865-Lincoln
that of neither has been answered fully,1865-Lincoln
the almighty has his own purposes,1865-Lincoln
woe unto the world because of offenses for it must needs be that offenses come but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh,1865-Lincoln
if we shall suppose that american slavery is one of those offenses which in the providence of god must needs come but which having continued through his appointed time he now wills to remove and that he gives to both north and south this terrible war as the woe due to those by whom the offense came shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living god always ascribe to him,1865-Lincoln
fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away,1865-Lincoln
yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman s two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said three thousand years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether,1865-Lincoln
with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nation s wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations,1865-Lincoln
citizens of the united states,1869-Grant
your suffrages having elected me to the office of president of the united states i have in conformity to the constitution of our country taken the oath of office prescribed therein,1869-Grant
i have taken this oath without mental reservation and with the determination to do to the best of my ability all that is required of me,1869-Grant
the responsibilities of the position i feel but accept them without fear,1869-Grant
the office has come to me unsought i commence its duties untrammeled,1869-Grant
i bring to it a conscious desire and determination to fill it to the best of my ability to the satisfaction of the people,1869-Grant
on all leading questions agitating the public mind i will always express my views to congress and urge them according to my judgment and when i think it advisable will exercise the constitutional privilege of interposing a veto to defeat measures which i oppose but all laws will be faithfully executed whether they meet my approval or not,1869-Grant
i shall on all subjects have a policy to recommend but none to enforce against the will of the people,1869-Grant
laws are to govern all alike those opposed as well as those who favor them,1869-Grant
i know no method to secure the repeal of bad or obnoxious laws so effective as their stringent execution,1869-Grant
the country having just emerged from a great rebellion many questions will come before it for settlement in the next four years which preceding administrations have never had to deal with,1869-Grant
in meeting these it is desirable that they should be approached calmly without prejudice hate or sectional pride remembering that the greatest good to the greatest number is the object to be attained,1869-Grant
this requires security of person property and free religious and political opinion in every part of our common country without regard to local prejudice,1869-Grant
all laws to secure these ends will receive my best efforts for their enforcement,1869-Grant
a great debt has been contracted in securing to us and our posterity the union,1869-Grant
the payment of this principal and interest as well as the return to a specie basis as soon as it can be accomplished without material detriment to the debtor class or to the country at large must be provided for,1869-Grant
to protect the national honor every dollar of government indebtedness should be paid in gold unless otherwise expressly stipulated in the contract,1869-Grant
let it be understood that no repudiator of one farthing of our public debt will be trusted in public place and it will go far toward strengthening a credit which ought to be the best in the world and will ultimately enable us to replace the debt with bonds bearing less interest than we now pay,1869-Grant
to this should be added a faithful collection of the revenue a strict accountability to the treasury for every dollar collected and the greatest practicable retrenchment in expenditure in every department of government,1869-Grant
when we compare the paying capacity of the country now with the ten states in poverty from the effects of war but soon to emerge i trust into greater prosperity than ever before with its paying capacity twenty five years ago and calculate what it probably will be twenty five years hence who can doubt the feasibility of paying every dollar then with more ease than we now pay for useless luxuries,1869-Grant
why it looks as though providence had bestowed upon us a strong box in the precious metals locked up in the sterile mountains of the far west and which we are now forging the key to unlock to meet the very contingency that is now upon us,1869-Grant
ultimately it may be necessary to insure the facilities to reach these riches and it may be necessary also that the general government should give its aid to secure this access but that should only be when a dollar of obligation to pay secures precisely the same sort of dollar to use now and not before,1869-Grant
whilst the question of specie payments is in abeyance the prudent business man is careful about contracting debts payable in the distant future,1869-Grant
the nation should follow the same rule,1869-Grant
a prostrate commerce is to be rebuilt and all industries encouraged,1869-Grant
the young men of the country those who from their age must be its rulers twenty five years hence have a peculiar interest in maintaining the national honor,1869-Grant
a moment s reflection as to what will be our commanding influence among the nations of the earth in their day if they are only true to themselves should inspire them with national pride,1869-Grant
all divisions geographical political and religious can join in this common sentiment,1869-Grant
how the public debt is to be paid or specie payments resumed is not so important as that a plan should be adopted and acquiesced in,1869-Grant
a united determination to do is worth more than divided counsels upon the method of doing,1869-Grant
legislation upon this subject may not be necessary now or even advisable but it will be when the civil law is more fully restored in all parts of the country and trade resumes its wonted channels,1869-Grant
it will be my endeavor to execute all laws in good faith to collect all revenues assessed and to have them properly accounted for and economically disbursed,1869-Grant
i will to the best of my ability appoint to office those only who will carry out this design,1869-Grant
in regard to foreign policy i would deal with nations as equitable law requires individuals to deal with each other and i would protect the law abiding citizen whether of native or foreign birth wherever his rights are jeopardized or the flag of our country floats,1869-Grant
i would respect the rights of all nations demanding equal respect for our own,1869-Grant
if others depart from this rule in their dealings with us we may be compelled to follow their precedent,1869-Grant
the proper treatment of the original occupants of this land the indians one deserving of careful study,1869-Grant
i will favor any course toward them which tends to their civilization and ultimate citizenship,1869-Grant
the question of suffrage is one which is likely to agitate the public so long as a portion of the citizens of the nation are excluded from its privileges in any state,1869-Grant
it seems to me very desirable that this question should be settled now and i entertain the hope and express the desire that it may be by the ratification of the fifteenth article of amendment to the constitution,1869-Grant
in conclusion i ask patient forbearance one toward another throughout the land and a determined effort on the part of every citizen to do his share toward cementing a happy union and i ask the prayers of the nation to almighty god in behalf of this consummation,1869-Grant
fellow citizens,1873-Grant
under providence i have been called a second time to act as executive over this great nation,1873-Grant
it has been my endeavor in the past to maintain all the laws and so far as lay in my power to act for the best interests of the whole people,1873-Grant
my best efforts will be given in the same direction in the future aided i trust by my four years experience in the office,1873-Grant
when my first term of the office of chief executive began the country had not recovered from the effects of a great internal revolution and three of the former states of the union had not been restored to their federal relations,1873-Grant
it seemed to me wise that no new questions should be raised so long as that condition of affairs existed,1873-Grant
therefore the past four years so far as i could control events have been consumed in the effort to restore harmony public credit commerce and all the arts of peace and progress,1873-Grant
it is my firm conviction that the civilized world is tending toward republicanism or government by the people through their chosen representatives and that our own great republic is destined to be the guiding star to all others,1873-Grant
under our republic we support an army less than that of any european power of any standing and a navy less than that of either of at least five of them,1873-Grant
there could be no extension of territory on the continent which would call for an increase of this force but rather might such extension enable us to diminish it,1873-Grant
the theory of government changes with general progress,1873-Grant
now that the telegraph is made available for communicating thought together with rapid transit by steam all parts of a continent are made contiguous for all purposes of government and communication between the extreme limits of the country made easier than it was throughout the old thirteen states at the beginning of our national existence,1873-Grant
the effects of the late civil strife have been to free the slave and make him a citizen,1873-Grant
yet he is not possessed of the civil rights which citizenship should carry with it,1873-Grant
this is wrong and should be corrected,1873-Grant
to this correction i stand committed so far as executive influence can avail,1873-Grant
social equality is not a subject to be legislated upon nor shall i ask that anything be done to advance the social status of the colored man except to give him a fair chance to develop what there is good in him give him access to the schools and when he travels let him feel assured that his conduct will regulate the treatment and fare he will receive,1873-Grant
the states lately at war with the general government are now happily rehabilitated and no executive control is exercised in any one of them that would not be exercised in any other state under like circumstances,1873-Grant
in the first year of the past administration the proposition came up for the admission of santo domingo as a territory of the union,1873-Grant
it was not a question of my seeking but was a proposition from the people of santo domingo and which i entertained,1873-Grant
i believe now as i did then that it was for the best interest of this country for the people of santo domingo and all concerned that the proposition should be received favorably,1873-Grant
it was however rejected constitutionally and therefore the subject was never brought up again by me,1873-Grant
in future while i hold my present office the subject of acquisition of territory must have the support of the people before i will recommend any proposition looking to such acquisition,1873-Grant
i say here however that i do not share in the apprehension held by many as to the danger of governments becoming weakened and destroyed by reason of their extension of territory,1873-Grant
commerce education and rapid transit of thought and matter by telegraph and steam have changed all this,1873-Grant
rather do i believe that our great maker is preparing the world in his own good time to become one nation speaking one language and when armies and navies will be no longer required,1873-Grant
my efforts in the future will be directed to the restoration of good feeling between the different sections of our common country to the restoration of our currency to a fixed value as compared with the world s standard of values gold and if possible to a par with it to the construction of cheap routes of transit throughout the land to the end that the products of all may find a market and leave a living remuneration to the producer to the maintenance of friendly relations with all our neighbors and with distant nations to the reestablishment of our commerce and share in the carrying trade upon the ocean to the encouragement of such manufacturing industries as can be economically pursued in this country to the end that the exports of home products and industries may pay for our imports the only sure method of returning to and permanently maintaining a specie basis to the elevation of labor and by a humane course to bring the aborigines of the country under the benign influences of education and civilization,1873-Grant
it is either this or war of extermination wars of extermination engaged in by people pursuing commerce and all industrial pursuits are expensive even against the weakest people and are demoralizing and wicked,1873-Grant
our superiority of strength and advantages of civilization should make us lenient toward the indian,1873-Grant
the wrong inflicted upon him should be taken into account and the balance placed to his credit,1873-Grant
the moral view of the question should be considered and the question asked can not the indian be made a useful and productive member of society by proper teaching and treatment,1873-Grant
if the effort is made in good faith we will stand better before the civilized nations of the earth and in our own consciences for having made it,1873-Grant
all these things are not to be accomplished by one individual but they will receive my support and such recommendations to congress as will in my judgment best serve to carry them into effect,1873-Grant
i beg your support and encouragement,1873-Grant
it has been and is my earnest desire to correct abuses that have grown up in the civil service of the country,1873-Grant
to secure this reformation rules regulating methods of appointment and promotions were established and have been tried,1873-Grant
my efforts for such reformation shall be continued to the best of my judgment,1873-Grant
the spirit of the rules adopted will be maintained,1873-Grant
i acknowledge before this assemblage representing as it does every section of our country the obligation i am under to my countrymen for the great honor they have conferred on me by returning me to the highest office within their gift and the further obligation resting on me to render to them the best services within my power,1873-Grant
this i promise looking forward with the greatest anxiety to the day when i shall be released from responsibilities that at times are almost overwhelming and from which i have scarcely had a respite since the eventful firing upon fort sumter in april 1861 to the present day,1873-Grant
my services were then tendered and accepted under the first call for troops growing out of that event,1873-Grant
i did not ask for place or position and was entirely without influence or the acquaintance of persons of influence but was resolved to perform my part in a struggle threatening the very existence of the nation,1873-Grant
i performed a conscientious duty without asking promotion or command and without a revengeful feeling toward any section or individual,1873-Grant
notwithstanding this throughout the war and from my candidacy for my present office in 1868 to the close of the last presidential campaign i have been the subject of abuse and slander scarcely ever equaled in political history which to day i feel that i can afford to disregard in view of your verdict which i gratefully accept as my vindication,1873-Grant
fellow citizens we have assembled to repeat the public ceremonial begun by washington observed by all my predecessors and now a time honored custom which marks the commencement of a new term of the presidential office,1877-Hayes
called to the duties of this great trust i proceed in compliance with usage to announce some of the leading principles on the subjects that now chiefly engage the public attention by which it is my desire to be guided in the discharge of those duties,1877-Hayes
i shall not undertake to lay down irrevocably principles or measures of administration but rather to speak of the motives which should animate us and to suggest certain important ends to be attained in accordance with our institutions and essential to the welfare of our country,1877-Hayes
at the outset of the discussions which preceded the recent presidential election it seemed to me fitting that i should fully make known my sentiments in regard to several of the important questions which then appeared to demand the consideration of the country,1877-Hayes
following the example and in part adopting the language of one of my predecessors i wish now when every motive for misrepresentation has passed away to repeat what was said before the election trusting that my countrymen will candidly weigh and understand it and that they will feel assured that the sentiments declared in accepting the nomination for the presidency will be the standard of my conduct in the path before me charged as i now am with the grave and difficult task of carrying them out in the practical administration of the government so far as depends under the constitution and laws on the chief executive of the nation,1877-Hayes
the permanent pacification of the country upon such principles and by such measures as will secure the complete protection of all its citizens in the free enjoyment of all their constitutional rights is now the one subject in our public affairs which all thoughtful and patriotic citizens regard as of supreme importance,1877-Hayes
many of the calamitous efforts of the tremendous revolution which has passed over the southern states still remain,1877-Hayes
the immeasurable benefits which will surely follow sooner or later the hearty and generous acceptance of the legitimate results of that revolution have not yet been realized,1877-Hayes
difficult and embarrassing questions meet us at the threshold of this subject,1877-Hayes
the people of those states are still impoverished and the inestimable blessing of wise honest and peaceful local self government is not fully enjoyed,1877-Hayes
whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the cause of this condition of things the fact is clear that in the progress of events the time has come when such government is the imperative necessity required by all the varied interests public and private of those states,1877-Hayes
but it must not be forgotten that only a local government which recognizes and maintains inviolate the rights of all is a true self government,1877-Hayes
with respect to the two distinct races whose peculiar relations to each other have brought upon us the deplorable complications and perplexities which exist in those states it must be a government which guards the interests of both races carefully and equally,1877-Hayes
it must be a government which submits loyally and heartily to the constitution and the laws the laws of the nation and the laws of the states themselves accepting and obeying faithfully the whole constitution as it is,1877-Hayes
resting upon this sure and substantial foundation the superstructure of beneficent local governments can be built up and not otherwise,1877-Hayes
in furtherance of such obedience to the letter and the spirit of the constitution and in behalf of all that its attainment implies all so called party interests lose their apparent importance and party lines may well be permitted to fade into insignificance,1877-Hayes
the question we have to consider for the immediate welfare of those states of the union is the question of government or no government of social order and all the peaceful industries and the happiness that belongs to it or a return to barbarism,1877-Hayes
it is a question in which every citizen of the nation is deeply interested and with respect to which we ought not to be in a partisan sense either republicans or democrats but fellow citizens and fellowmen to whom the interests of a common country and a common humanity are dear,1877-Hayes
the sweeping revolution of the entire labor system of a large portion of our country and the advance of 4 000 000 people from a condition of servitude to that of citizenship upon an equal footing with their former masters could not occur without presenting problems of the gravest moment to be dealt with by the emancipated race by their former masters and by the general government the author of the act of emancipation,1877-Hayes
that it was a wise just and providential act fraught with good for all concerned is not generally conceded throughout the country,1877-Hayes
that a moral obligation rests upon the national government to employ its constitutional power and influence to establish the rights of the people it has emancipated and to protect them in the enjoyment of those rights when they are infringed or assailed is also generally admitted,1877-Hayes
the evils which afflict the southern states can only be removed or remedied by the united and harmonious efforts of both races actuated by motives of mutual sympathy and regard and while in duty bound and fully determined to protect the rights of all by every constitutional means at the disposal of my administration i am sincerely anxious to use every legitimate influence in favor of honest and efficient local self government as the true resource of those states for the promotion of the contentment and prosperity of their citizens,1877-Hayes
in the effort i shall make to accomplish this purpose i ask the cordial cooperation of all who cherish an interest in the welfare of the country trusting that party ties and the prejudice of race will be freely surrendered in behalf of the great purpose to be accomplished,1877-Hayes
in the important work of restoring the south it is not the political situation alone that merits attention,1877-Hayes
the material development of that section of the country has been arrested by the social and political revolution through which it has passed and now needs and deserves the considerate care of the national government within the just limits prescribed by the constitution and wise public economy,1877-Hayes
but at the basis of all prosperity for that as well as for every other part of the country lies the improvement of the intellectual and moral condition of the people,1877-Hayes
universal suffrage should rest upon universal education,1877-Hayes
to this end liberal and permanent provision should be made for the support of free schools by the state governments and if need be supplemented by legitimate aid from national authority,1877-Hayes
let me assure my countrymen of the southern states that it is my earnest desire to regard and promote their truest interest the interests of the white and of the colored people both and equally and to put forth my best efforts in behalf of a civil policy which will forever wipe out in our political affairs the color line and the distinction between north and south to the end that we may have not merely a united north or a united south but a united country,1877-Hayes
i ask the attention of the public to the paramount necessity of reform in our civil service a reform not merely as to certain abuses and practices of so called official patronage which have come to have the sanction of usage in the several departments of our government but a change in the system of appointment itself a reform that shall be thorough radical and complete a return to the principles and practices of the founders of the government,1877-Hayes
they neither expected nor desired from public officers any partisan service,1877-Hayes
they meant that public officers should owe their whole service to the government and to the people,1877-Hayes
they meant that the officer should be secure in his tenure as long as his personal character remained untarnished and the performance of his duties satisfactory,1877-Hayes
they held that appointments to office were not to be made nor expected merely as rewards for partisan services nor merely on the nomination of members of congress as being entitled in any respect to the control of such appointments,1877-Hayes
the fact that both the great political parties of the country in declaring their principles prior to the election gave a prominent place to the subject of reform of our civil service recognizing and strongly urging its necessity in terms almost identical in their specific import with those i have here employed must be accepted as a conclusive argument in behalf of these measures,1877-Hayes
it must be regarded as the expression of the united voice and will of the whole country upon this subject and both political parties are virtually pledged to give it their unreserved support,1877-Hayes
the president of the united states of necessity owes his election to office to the suffrage and zealous labors of a political party the members of which cherish with ardor and regard as of essential importance the principles of their party organization but he should strive to be always mindful of the fact that he serves his party best who serves the country best,1877-Hayes
in furtherance of the reform we seek and in other important respects a change of great importance i recommend an amendment to the constitution prescribing a term of six years for the presidential office and forbidding a reelection,1877-Hayes
with respect to the financial condition of the country i shall not attempt an extended history of the embarrassment and prostration which we have suffered during the past three years,1877-Hayes
the depression in all our varied commercial and manufacturing interests throughout the country which began in september 1873 still continues,1877-Hayes
it is very gratifying however to be able to say that there are indications all around us of a coming change to prosperous times,1877-Hayes
upon the currency question intimately connected as it is with this topic i may be permitted to repeat here the statement made in my letter of acceptance that in my judgment the feeling of uncertainty inseparable from an irredeemable paper currency with its fluctuation of values is one of the greatest obstacles to a return to prosperous times,1877-Hayes
the only safe paper currency is one which rests upon a coin basis and is at all times and promptly convertible into coin,1877-Hayes
i adhere to the views heretofore expressed by me in favor of congressional legislation in behalf of an early resumption of specie payments and i am satisfied not only that this is wise but that the interests as well as the public sentiment of the country imperatively demand it,1877-Hayes
passing from these remarks upon the condition of our own country to consider our relations with other lands we are reminded by the international complications abroad threatening the peace of europe that our traditional rule of noninterference in the affairs of foreign nations has proved of great value in past times and ought to be strictly observed,1877-Hayes
the policy inaugurated by my honored predecessor president grant of submitting to arbitration grave questions in dispute between ourselves and foreign powers points to a new and incomparably the best instrumentality for the preservation of peace and will as i believe become a beneficent example of the course to be pursued in similar emergencies by other nations,1877-Hayes
if unhappily questions of difference should at any time during the period of my administration arise between the united states and any foreign government it will certainly be my disposition and my hope to aid in their settlement in the same peaceful and honorable way thus securing to our country the great blessings of peace and mutual good offices with all the nations of the world,1877-Hayes
fellow citizens we have reached the close of a political contest marked by the excitement which usually attends the contests between great political parties whose members espouse and advocate with earnest faith their respective creeds,1877-Hayes
the circumstances were perhaps in no respect extraordinary save in the closeness and the consequent uncertainty of the result,1877-Hayes
for the first time in the history of the country it has been deemed best in view of the peculiar circumstances of the case that the objections and questions in dispute with reference to the counting of the electoral votes should be referred to the decision of a tribunal appointed for this purpose,1877-Hayes
that tribunal established by law for this sole purpose its members all of them men of long established reputation for integrity and intelligence and with the exception of those who are also members of the supreme judiciary chosen equally from both political parties its deliberations enlightened by the research and the arguments of able counsel was entitled to the fullest confidence of the american people,1877-Hayes
its decisions have been patiently waited for and accepted as legally conclusive by the general judgment of the public,1877-Hayes
for the present opinion will widely vary as to the wisdom of the several conclusions announced by that tribunal,1877-Hayes
this is to be anticipated in every instance where matters of dispute are made the subject of arbitration under the forms of law,1877-Hayes
human judgment is never unerring and is rarely regarded as otherwise than wrong by the unsuccessful party in the contest,1877-Hayes
the fact that two great political parties have in this way settled a dispute in regard to which good men differ as to the facts and the law no less than as to the proper course to be pursued in solving the question in controversy is an occasion for general rejoicing,1877-Hayes
upon one point there is entire unanimity in public sentiment that conflicting claims to the presidency must be amicably and peaceably adjusted and that when so adjusted the general acquiescence of the nation ought surely to follow,1877-Hayes
it has been reserved for a government of the people where the right of suffrage is universal to give to the world the first example in history of a great nation in the midst of the struggle of opposing parties for power hushing its party tumults to yield the issue of the contest to adjustment according to the forms of law,1877-Hayes
looking for the guidance of that divine hand by which the destinies of nations and individuals are shaped i call upon you senators representatives judges fellow citizens here and everywhere to unite with me in an earnest effort to secure to our country the blessings not only of material prosperity but of justice peace and union a union depending not upon the constraint of force but upon the loving devotion of a free people and that all things may be so ordered and settled upon the best and surest foundations that peace and happiness truth and justice religion and piety may be established among us for all generations,1877-Hayes
fellow citizens,1881-Garfield
we stand to day upon an eminence which overlooks a hundred years of national life a century crowded with perils but crowned with the triumphs of liberty and law,1881-Garfield
before continuing the onward march let us pause on this height for a moment to strengthen our faith and renew our hope by a glance at the pathway along which our people have traveled,1881-Garfield
it is now three days more than a hundred years since the adoption of the first written constitution of the united states the articles of confederation and perpetual union,1881-Garfield
the new republic was then beset with danger on every hand,1881-Garfield
it had not conquered a place in the family of nations,1881-Garfield
the decisive battle of the war for independence whose centennial anniversary will soon be gratefully celebrated at yorktown had not yet been fought,1881-Garfield
the colonists were struggling not only against the armies of a great nation but against the settled opinions of mankind for the world did not then believe that the supreme authority of government could be safely intrusted to the guardianship of the people themselves,1881-Garfield
we can not overestimate the fervent love of liberty the intelligent courage and the sum of common sense with which our fathers made the great experiment of self government,1881-Garfield
when they found after a short trial that the confederacy of states was too weak to meet the necessities of a vigorous and expanding republic they boldly set it aside and in its stead established a national union founded directly upon the will of the people endowed with full power of self preservation and ample authority for the accomplishment of its great object,1881-Garfield
under this constitution the boundaries of freedom have been enlarged the foundations of order and peace have been strengthened and the growth of our people in all the better elements of national life has indicated the wisdom of the founders and given new hope to their descendants,1881-Garfield
under this constitution our people long ago made themselves safe against danger from without and secured for their mariners and flag equality of rights on all the seas,1881-Garfield
under this constitution twenty five states have been added to the union with constitutions and laws framed and enforced by their own citizens to secure the manifold blessings of local self government,1881-Garfield
the jurisdiction of this constitution now covers an area five times greater than that of the original thirteen states and a population twenty times greater than that of 1780,1881-Garfield
the supreme trial of the constitution came at last under the tremendous pressure of civil war,1881-Garfield
we ourselves are witnesses that the union emerged from the blood and fire of that conflict purified and made stronger for all the beneficent purposes of good government,1881-Garfield
and now at the close of this first century of growth with the inspirations of its history in their hearts our people have lately reviewed the condition of the nation passed judgment upon the conduct and opinions of political parties and have registered their will concerning the future administration of the government,1881-Garfield
to interpret and to execute that will in accordance with the constitution is the paramount duty of the executive,1881-Garfield
even from this brief review it is manifest that the nation is resolutely facing to the front resolved to employ its best energies in developing the great possibilities of the future,1881-Garfield
sacredly preserving whatever has been gained to liberty and good government during the century our people are determined to leave behind them all those bitter controversies concerning things which have been irrevocably settled and the further discussion of which can only stir up strife and delay the onward march,1881-Garfield
the supremacy of the nation and its laws should be no longer a subject of debate,1881-Garfield
that discussion which for half a century threatened the existence of the union was closed at last in the high court of war by a decree from which there is no appeal that the constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof are and shall continue to be the supreme law of the land binding alike upon the states and the people,1881-Garfield
this decree does not disturb the autonomy of the states nor interfere with any of their necessary rights of local self government but it does fix and establish the permanent supremacy of the union,1881-Garfield
the will of the nation speaking with the voice of battle and through the amended constitution has fulfilled the great promise of 1776 by proclaiming liberty throughout the land to all the inhabitants thereof,1881-Garfield
the elevation of the negro race from slavery to the full rights of citizenship is the most important political change we have known since the adoption of the constitution of 1787,1881-Garfield
no thoughtful man can fail to appreciate its beneficent effect upon our institutions and people,1881-Garfield
it has freed us from the perpetual danger of war and dissolution,1881-Garfield
it has added immensely to the moral and industrial forces of our people,1881-Garfield
it has liberated the master as well as the slave from a relation which wronged and enfeebled both,1881-Garfield
it has surrendered to their own guardianship the manhood of more than 5 000 000 people and has opened to each one of them a career of freedom and usefulness,1881-Garfield
it has given new inspiration to the power of self help in both races by making labor more honorable to the one and more necessary to the other,1881-Garfield
the influence of this force will grow greater and bear richer fruit with the coming years,1881-Garfield
no doubt this great change has caused serious disturbance to our southern communities,1881-Garfield
this is to be deplored though it was perhaps unavoidable,1881-Garfield
but those who resisted the change should remember that under our institutions there was no middle ground for the negro race between slavery and equal citizenship,1881-Garfield
there can be no permanent disfranchised peasantry in the united states,1881-Garfield
freedom can never yield its fullness of blessings so long as the law or its administration places the smallest obstacle in the pathway of any virtuous citizen,1881-Garfield
the emancipated race has already made remarkable progress,1881-Garfield
with unquestioning devotion to the union with a patience and gentleness not born of fear they have followed the light as god gave them to see the light,1881-Garfield
they are rapidly laying the material foundations of self support widening their circle of intelligence and beginning to enjoy the blessings that gather around the homes of the industrious poor,1881-Garfield
they deserve the generous encouragement of all good men,1881-Garfield
so far as my authority can lawfully extend they shall enjoy the full and equal protection of the constitution and the laws,1881-Garfield
the free enjoyment of equal suffrage is still in question and a frank statement of the issue may aid its solution,1881-Garfield
it is alleged that in many communities negro citizens are practically denied the freedom of the ballot,1881-Garfield
in so far as the truth of this allegation is admitted it is answered that in many places honest local government is impossible if the mass of uneducated negroes are allowed to vote,1881-Garfield
these are grave allegations,1881-Garfield
so far as the latter is true it is the only palliation that can be offered for opposing the freedom of the ballot,1881-Garfield
bad local government is certainly a great evil which ought to be prevented but to violate the freedom and sanctities of the suffrage is more than an evil,1881-Garfield
it is a crime which if persisted in will destroy the government itself,1881-Garfield
suicide is not a remedy,1881-Garfield
if in other lands it be high treason to compass the death of the king it shall be counted no less a crime here to strangle our sovereign power and stifle its voice,1881-Garfield
it has been said that unsettled questions have no pity for the repose of nations,1881-Garfield
it should be said with the utmost emphasis that this question of the suffrage will never give repose or safety to the states or to the nation until each within its own jurisdiction makes and keeps the ballot free and pure by the strong sanctions of the law,1881-Garfield
but the danger which arises from ignorance in the voter can not be denied,1881-Garfield
it covers a field far wider than that of negro suffrage and the present condition of the race,1881-Garfield
it is a danger that lurks and hides in the sources and fountains of power in every state,1881-Garfield
we have no standard by which to measure the disaster that may be brought upon us by ignorance and vice in the citizens when joined to corruption and fraud in the suffrage,1881-Garfield
the voters of the union who make and unmake constitutions and upon whose will hang the destinies of our governments can transmit their supreme authority to no successors save the coming generation of voters who are the sole heirs of sovereign power,1881-Garfield
if that generation comes to its inheritance blinded by ignorance and corrupted by vice the fall of the republic will be certain and remediless,1881-Garfield
the census has already sounded the alarm in the appalling figures which mark how dangerously high the tide of illiteracy has risen among our voters and their children,1881-Garfield
to the south this question is of supreme importance,1881-Garfield
but the responsibility for the existence of slavery did not rest upon the south alone,1881-Garfield
the nation itself is responsible for the extension of the suffrage and is under special obligations to aid in removing the illiteracy which it has added to the voting population,1881-Garfield
for the north and south alike there is but one remedy,1881-Garfield
all the constitutional power of the nation and of the states and all the volunteer forces of the people should be surrendered to meet this danger by the savory influence of universal education,1881-Garfield
it is the high privilege and sacred duty of those now living to educate their successors and fit them by intelligence and virtue for the inheritance which awaits them,1881-Garfield
in this beneficent work sections and races should be forgotten and partisanship should be unknown,1881-Garfield
let our people find a new meaning in the divine oracle which declares that a little child shall lead them for our own little children will soon control the destinies of the republic,1881-Garfield
my countrymen we do not now differ in our judgment concerning the controversies of past generations and fifty years hence our children will not be divided in their opinions concerning our controversies,1881-Garfield
they will surely bless their fathers and their fathers god that the union was preserved that slavery was overthrown and that both races were made equal before the law,1881-Garfield
we may hasten or we may retard but we can not prevent the final reconciliation,1881-Garfield
is it not possible for us now to make a truce with time by anticipating and accepting its inevitable verdict,1881-Garfield
enterprises of the highest importance to our moral and material well being unite us and offer ample employment of our best powers,1881-Garfield
let all our people leaving behind them the battlefields of dead issues move forward and in their strength of liberty and the restored union win the grander victories of peace,1881-Garfield
the prosperity which now prevails is without parallel in our history,1881-Garfield
fruitful seasons have done much to secure it but they have not done all,1881-Garfield
the preservation of the public credit and the resumption of specie payments so successfully attained by the administration of my predecessors have enabled our people to secure the blessings which the seasons brought,1881-Garfield
by the experience of commercial nations in all ages it has been found that gold and silver afford the only safe foundation for a monetary system,1881-Garfield
confusion has recently been created by variations in the relative value of the two metals but i confidently believe that arrangements can be made between the leading commercial nations which will secure the general use of both metals,1881-Garfield
congress should provide that the compulsory coinage of silver now required by law may not disturb our monetary system by driving either metal of circulation,1881-Garfield
if possible such an adjustment should be made that the purchasing power of every coined dollar will be exactly equal to its debt paying power in all the markets of the world,1881-Garfield
the chief duty of the national government in connection with the currency of the country is to coin money and declare its value,1881-Garfield
grave doubts have been entertained whether congress is authorized by the constitution to make any form of paper money legal tender,1881-Garfield
the present issue of united states notes has been sustained by the necessities of war but such paper should depend for its value and currency upon its convenience in use and its prompt redemption in coin at the will of the holder and not upon its compulsory circulation,1881-Garfield
these notes are not money but promises to pay money,1881-Garfield
if the holders demand it the promise should be kept,1881-Garfield
the refunding of the national debt at a lower rate of interest should be accomplished without compelling the withdrawal of the national bank notes and thus disturbing the business of the country,1881-Garfield
i venture to refer to the position i have occupied on financial questions during a long service in congress and to say that time and experience have strengthened the opinions i have so often expressed on these subjects,1881-Garfield
the finances of the government shall suffer no detriment which it may be possible for my administration to prevent,1881-Garfield
the interests of agriculture deserve more attention from the government than they have yet received,1881-Garfield
the farms of the united states afford homes and employment for more than one half our people and furnish much the largest part of all our exports,1881-Garfield
as the government lights our coasts for the protection of mariners and the benefit of commerce so it should give to the tillers of the soil the best lights of practical science and experience,1881-Garfield
our manufacturers are rapidly making us industrially independent and are opening to capital and labor new and profitable fields of employment,1881-Garfield
their steady and healthy growth should still be matured,1881-Garfield
our facilities for transportation should be promoted by the continued improvement of our harbors and great interior waterways and by the increase of our tonnage on the ocean,1881-Garfield
the development of the world s commerce has led to an urgent demand for shortening the great sea voyage around cape horn by constructing ship canals or railways across the isthmus which unites the continents,1881-Garfield
various plans to this end have been suggested and will need consideration but none of them has been sufficiently matured to warrant the united states in extending pecuniary aid,1881-Garfield
the subject however is one which will immediately engage the attention of the government with a view to a thorough protection to american interests,1881-Garfield
we will urge no narrow policy nor seek peculiar or exclusive privileges in any commercial route but in the language of my predecessor i believe it to be the right and duty of the united states to assert and maintain such supervision and authority over any interoceanic canal across the isthmus that connects north and south america as will protect our national interest,1881-Garfield
the constitution guarantees absolute religious freedom,1881-Garfield
congress is prohibited from making any law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,1881-Garfield
the territories of the united states are subject to the direct legislative authority of congress and hence the general government is responsible for any violation of the constitution in any of them,1881-Garfield
it is therefore a reproach to the government that in the most populous of the territories the constitutional guaranty is not enjoyed by the people and the authority of congress is set at naught,1881-Garfield
the mormon church not only offends the moral sense of manhood by sanctioning polygamy but prevents the administration of justice through ordinary instrumentalities of law,1881-Garfield
in my judgment it is the duty of congress while respecting to the uttermost the conscientious convictions and religious scruples of every citizen to prohibit within its jurisdiction all criminal practices especially of that class which destroy the family relations and endanger social order,1881-Garfield
nor can any ecclesiastical organization be safely permitted to usurp in the smallest degree the functions and powers of the national government,1881-Garfield
the civil service can never be placed on a satisfactory basis until it is regulated by law,1881-Garfield
for the good of the service itself for the protection of those who are intrusted with the appointing power against the waste of time and obstruction to the public business caused by the inordinate pressure for place and for the protection of incumbents against intrigue and wrong i shall at the proper time ask congress to fix the tenure of the minor offices of the several executive departments and prescribe the grounds upon which removals shall be made during the terms for which incumbents have been appointed,1881-Garfield
finally acting always within the authority and limitations of the constitution invading neither the rights of the states nor the reserved rights of the people it will be the purpose of my administration to maintain the authority of the nation in all places within its jurisdiction to enforce obedience to all the laws of the union in the interests of the people to demand rigid economy in all the expenditures of the government and to require the honest and faithful service of all executive officers remembering that the offices were created not for the benefit of incumbents or their supporters but for the service of the government,1881-Garfield
and now fellow citizens i am about to assume the great trust which you have committed to my hands,1881-Garfield
i appeal to you for that earnest and thoughtful support which makes this government in fact as it is in law a government of the people,1881-Garfield
i shall greatly rely upon the wisdom and patriotism of congress and of those who may share with me the responsibilities and duties of administration and above all upon our efforts to promote the welfare of this great people and their government i reverently invoke the support and blessings of almighty god,1881-Garfield
fellow citizens in the presence of this vast assemblage of my countrymen i am about to supplement and seal by the oath which i shall take the manifestation of the will of a great and free people,1885-Cleveland
in the exercise of their power and right of self government they have committed to one of their fellow citizens a supreme and sacred trust and he here consecrates himself to their service,1885-Cleveland
this impressive ceremony adds little to the solemn sense of responsibility with which i contemplate the duty i owe to all the people of the land,1885-Cleveland
nothing can relieve me from anxiety lest by any act of mine their interests may suffer and nothing is needed to strengthen my resolution to engage every faculty and effort in the promotion of their welfare,1885-Cleveland
amid the din of party strife the people s choice was made but its attendant circumstances have demonstrated anew the strength and safety of a government by the people,1885-Cleveland
in each succeeding year it more clearly appears that our democratic principle needs no apology and that in its fearless and faithful application is to be found the surest guaranty of good government,1885-Cleveland
but the best results in the operation of a government wherein every citizen has a share largely depend upon a proper limitation of purely partisan zeal and effort and a correct appreciation of the time when the heat of the partisan should be merged in the patriotism of the citizen,1885-Cleveland
today the executive branch of the government is transferred to new keeping,1885-Cleveland
but this is still the government of all the people and it should be none the less an object of their affectionate solicitude,1885-Cleveland
at this hour the animosities of political strife the bitterness of partisan defeat and the exultation of partisan triumph should be supplanted by an ungrudging acquiescence in the popular will and a sober conscientious concern for the general weal,1885-Cleveland
moreover if from this hour we cheerfully and honestly abandon all sectional prejudice and distrust and determine with manly confidence in one another to work out harmoniously the achievements of our national destiny we shall deserve to realize all the benefits which our happy form of government can bestow,1885-Cleveland
on this auspicious occasion we may well renew the pledge of our devotion to the constitution which launched by the founders of the republic and consecrated by their prayers and patriotic devotion has for almost a century borne the hopes and the aspirations of a great people through prosperity and peace and through the shock of foreign conflicts and the perils of domestic strife and vicissitudes,1885-Cleveland
by the father of his country our constitution was commended for adoption as the result of a spirit of amity and mutual concession,1885-Cleveland
in that same spirit it should be administered in order to promote the lasting welfare of the country and to secure the full measure of its priceless benefits to us and to those who will succeed to the blessings of our national life,1885-Cleveland
the large variety of diverse and competing interests subject to federal control persistently seeking the recognition of their claims need give us no fear that the greatest good to the greatest number will fail to be accomplished if in the halls of national legislation that spirit of amity and mutual concession shall prevail in which the constitution had its birth,1885-Cleveland
if this involves the surrender or postponement of private interests and the abandonment of local advantages compensation will be found in the assurance that the common interest is subserved and the general welfare advanced,1885-Cleveland
in the discharge of my official duty i shall endeavor to be guided by a just and unstrained construction of the constitution a careful observance of the distinction between the powers granted to the federal government and those reserved to the states or to the people and by a cautious appreciation of those functions which by the constitution and laws have been especially assigned to the executive branch of the government,1885-Cleveland
but he who takes the oath today to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states only assumes the solemn obligation which every patriotic citizen on the farm in the workshop in the busy marts of trade and everywhere should share with him,1885-Cleveland
the constitution which prescribes his oath my countrymen is yours the government you have chosen him to administer for a time is yours the suffrage which executes the will of freemen is yours the laws and the entire scheme of our civil rule from the town meeting to the state capitals and the national capital is yours,1885-Cleveland
your every voter as surely as your chief magistrate under the same high sanction though in a different sphere exercises a public trust,1885-Cleveland
nor is this all,1885-Cleveland
every citizen owes to the country a vigilant watch and close scrutiny of its public servants and a fair and reasonable estimate of their fidelity and usefulness,1885-Cleveland
thus is the people s will impressed upon the whole framework of our civil polity municipal state and federal and this is the price of our liberty and the inspiration of our faith in the republic,1885-Cleveland
it is the duty of those serving the people in public place to closely limit public expenditures to the actual needs of the government economically administered because this bounds the right of the government to exact tribute from the earnings of labor or the property of the citizen and because public extravagance begets extravagance among the people,1885-Cleveland
we should never be ashamed of the simplicity and prudential economies which are best suited to the operation of a republican form of government and most compatible with the mission of the american people,1885-Cleveland
those who are selected for a limited time to manage public affairs are still of the people and may do much by their example to encourage consistently with the dignity of their official functions that plain way of life which among their fellow citizens aids integrity and promotes thrift and prosperity,1885-Cleveland
the genius of our institutions the needs of our people in their home life and the attention which is demanded for the settlement and development of the resources of our vast territory dictate the scrupulous avoidance of any departure from that foreign policy commended by the history the traditions and the prosperity of our republic,1885-Cleveland
it is the policy of independence favored by our position and defended by our known love of justice and by our power,1885-Cleveland
it is the policy of peace suitable to our interests,1885-Cleveland
it is the policy of neutrality rejecting any share in foreign broils and ambitions upon other continents and repelling their intrusion here,1885-Cleveland
it is the policy of monroe and of washington and jefferson peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliance with none,1885-Cleveland
a due regard for the interests and prosperity of all the people demands that our finances shall be established upon such a sound and sensible basis as shall secure the safety and confidence of business interests and make the wage of labor sure and steady and that our system of revenue shall be so adjusted as to relieve the people of unnecessary taxation having a due regard to the interests of capital invested and workingmen employed in american industries and preventing the accumulation of a surplus in the treasury to tempt extravagance and waste,1885-Cleveland
care for the property of the nation and for the needs of future settlers requires that the public domain should be protected from purloining schemes and unlawful occupation,1885-Cleveland
the conscience of the people demands that the indians within our boundaries shall be fairly and honestly treated as wards of the government and their education and civilization promoted with a view to their ultimate citizenship and that polygamy in the territories destructive of the family relation and offensive to the moral sense of the civilized world shall be repressed,1885-Cleveland
the laws should be rigidly enforced which prohibit the immigration of a servile class to compete with american labor with no intention of acquiring citizenship and bringing with them and retaining habits and customs repugnant to our civilization,1885-Cleveland
the people demand reform in the administration of the government and the application of business principles to public affairs,1885-Cleveland
as a means to this end civil service reform should be in good faith enforced,1885-Cleveland
our citizens have the right to protection from the incompetency of public employees who hold their places solely as the reward of partisan service and from the corrupting influence of those who promise and the vicious methods of those who expect such rewards and those who worthily seek public employment have the right to insist that merit and competency shall be recognized instead of party subserviency or the surrender of honest political belief,1885-Cleveland
in the administration of a government pledged to do equal and exact justice to all men there should be no pretext for anxiety touching the protection of the freedmen in their rights or their security in the enjoyment of their privileges under the constitution and its amendments,1885-Cleveland
all discussion as to their fitness for the place accorded to them as american citizens is idle and unprofitable except as it suggests the necessity for their improvement,1885-Cleveland
the fact that they are citizens entitles them to all the rights due to that relation and charges them with all its duties obligations and responsibilities,1885-Cleveland
these topics and the constant and ever varying wants of an active and enterprising population may well receive the attention and the patriotic endeavor of all who make and execute the federal law,1885-Cleveland
our duties are practical and call for industrious application an intelligent perception of the claims of public office and above all a firm determination by united action to secure to all the people of the land the full benefits of the best form of government ever vouchsafed to man,1885-Cleveland
and let us not trust to human effort alone but humbly acknowledging the power and goodness of almighty god who presides over the destiny of nations and who has at all times been revealed in our country s history let us invoke his aid and his blessings upon our labors,1885-Cleveland
fellow citizens there is no constitutional or legal requirement that the president shall take the oath of office in the presence of the people but there is so manifest an appropriateness in the public induction to office of the chief executive officer of the nation that from the beginning of the government the people to whose service the official oath consecrates the officer have been called to witness the solemn ceremonial,1889-Harrison
the oath taken in the presence of the people becomes a mutual covenant,1889-Harrison
the officer covenants to serve the whole body of the people by a faithful execution of the laws so that they may be the unfailing defense and security of those who respect and observe them and that neither wealth station nor the power of combinations shall be able to evade their just penalties or to wrest them from a beneficent public purpose to serve the ends of cruelty or selfishness,1889-Harrison
my promise is spoken yours unspoken but not the less real and solemn,1889-Harrison
the people of every state have here their representatives,1889-Harrison
surely i do not misinterpret the spirit of the occasion when i assume that the whole body of the people covenant with me and with each other to day to support and defend the constitution and the union of the states to yield willing obedience to all the laws and each to every other citizen his equal civil and political rights,1889-Harrison
entering thus solemnly into covenant with each other we may reverently invoke and confidently expect the favor and help of almighty god that he will give to me wisdom strength and fidelity and to our people a spirit of fraternity and a love of righteousness and peace,1889-Harrison
this occasion derives peculiar interest from the fact that the presidential term which begins this day is the twenty sixth under our constitution,1889-Harrison
the first inauguration of president washington took place in new york where congress was then sitting on the 30th day of april 1789 having been deferred by reason of delays attending the organization of the congress and the canvass of the electoral vote,1889-Harrison
our people have already worthily observed the centennials of the declaration of independence of the battle of yorktown and of the adoption of the constitution and will shortly celebrate in new york the institution of the second great department of our constitutional scheme of government,1889-Harrison
when the centennial of the institution of the judicial department by the organization of the supreme court shall have been suitably observed as i trust it will be our nation will have full entered its second century,1889-Harrison
i will not attempt to note the marvelous and in great part happy contrasts between our country as it steps over the threshold into its second century of organized existence under the constitution and that weak but wisely ordered young nation that looked undauntedly down the first century when all its years stretched out before it,1889-Harrison
our people will not fail at this time to recall the incidents which accompanied the institution of government under the constitution or to find inspiration and guidance in the teachings and example of washington and his great associates and hope and courage in the contrast which thirty eight populous and prosperous states offer to the thirteen states weak in everything except courage and the love of liberty that then fringed our atlantic seaboard,1889-Harrison
the territory of dakota has now a population greater than any of the original states except virginia and greater than the aggregate of five of the smaller states in 1790,1889-Harrison
the center of population when our national capital was located was east of baltimore and it was argued by many well informed persons that it would move eastward rather than westward yet in 1880 it was found to be near cincinnati and the new census about to be taken will show another stride to the westward,1889-Harrison
that which was the body has come to be only the rich fringe of the nation s robe,1889-Harrison
but our growth has not been limited to territory population and aggregate wealth marvelous as it has been in each of those directions,1889-Harrison
the masses of our people are better fed clothed and housed than their fathers were,1889-Harrison
the facilities for popular education have been vastly enlarged and more generally diffused,1889-Harrison
the virtues of courage and patriotism have given recent proof of their continued presence and increasing power in the hearts and over the lives of our people,1889-Harrison
the influences of religion have been multiplied and strengthened,1889-Harrison
the sweet offices of charity have greatly increased,1889-Harrison
the virtue of temperance is held in higher estimation,1889-Harrison
we have not attained an ideal condition,1889-Harrison
not all of our people are happy and prosperous not all of them are virtuous and law abiding,1889-Harrison
but on the whole the opportunities offered to the individual to secure the comforts of life are better than are found elsewhere and largely better than they were here one hundred years ago,1889-Harrison
the surrender of a large measure of sovereignty to the general government effected by the adoption of the constitution was not accomplished until the suggestions of reason were strongly reenforced by the more imperative voice of experience,1889-Harrison
the divergent interests of peace speedily demanded a more perfect union,1889-Harrison
the merchant the shipmaster and the manufacturer discovered and disclosed to our statesmen and to the people that commercial emancipation must be added to the political freedom which had been so bravely won,1889-Harrison
the commercial policy of the mother country had not relaxed any of its hard and oppressive features,1889-Harrison
to hold in check the development of our commercial marine to prevent or retard the establishment and growth of manufactures in the states and so to secure the american market for their shops and the carrying trade for their ships was the policy of european statesmen and was pursued with the most selfish vigor,1889-Harrison
petitions poured in upon congress urging the imposition of discriminating duties that should encourage the production of needed things at home,1889-Harrison
the patriotism of the people which no longer found afield of exercise in war was energetically directed to the duty of equipping the young republic for the defense of its independence by making its people self dependent,1889-Harrison
societies for the promotion of home manufactures and for encouraging the use of domestics in the dress of the people were organized in many of the states,1889-Harrison
the revival at the end of the century of the same patriotic interest in the preservation and development of domestic industries and the defense of our working people against injurious foreign competition is an incident worthy of attention,1889-Harrison
it is not a departure but a return that we have witnessed,1889-Harrison
the protective policy had then its opponents,1889-Harrison
the argument was made as now that its benefits inured to particular classes or sections,1889-Harrison
if the question became in any sense or at any time sectional it was only because slavery existed in some of the states,1889-Harrison
but for this there was no reason why the cotton producing states should not have led or walked abreast with the new england states in the production of cotton fabrics,1889-Harrison
there was this reason only why the states that divide with pennsylvania the mineral treasures of the great southeastern and central mountain ranges should have been so tardy in bringing to the smelting furnace and to the mill the coal and iron from their near opposing hillsides,1889-Harrison
mill fires were lighted at the funeral pile of slavery,1889-Harrison
the emancipation proclamation was heard in the depths of the earth as well as in the sky men were made free and material things became our better servants,1889-Harrison
the sectional element has happily been eliminated from the tariff discussion,1889-Harrison
we have no longer states that are necessarily only planting states,1889-Harrison
none are excluded from achieving that diversification of pursuits among the people which brings wealth and contentment,1889-Harrison
the cotton plantation will not be less valuable when the product is spun in the country town by operatives whose necessities call for diversified crops and create a home demand for garden and agricultural products,1889-Harrison
every new mine furnace and factory is an extension of the productive capacity of the state more real and valuable than added territory,1889-Harrison
shall the prejudices and paralysis of slavery continue to hang upon the skirts of progress,1889-Harrison
how long will those who rejoice that slavery no longer exists cherish or tolerate the incapacities it put upon their communities,1889-Harrison
i look hopefully to the continuance of our protective system and to the consequent development of manufacturing and mining enterprises in the states hitherto wholly given to agriculture as a potent influence in the perfect unification of our people,1889-Harrison
the men who have invested their capital in these enterprises the farmers who have felt the benefit of their neighborhood and the men who work in shop or field will not fail to find and to defend a community of interest,1889-Harrison
is it not quite possible that the farmers and the promoters of the great mining and manufacturing enterprises which have recently been established in the south may yet find that the free ballot of the workingman without distinction of race is needed for their defense as well as for his own,1889-Harrison
i do not doubt that if those men in the south who now accept the tariff views of clay and the constitutional expositions of webster would courageously avow and defend their real convictions they would not find it difficult by friendly instruction and cooperation to make the black man their efficient and safe ally not only in establishing correct principles in our national administration but in preserving for their local communities the benefits of social order and economical and honest government,1889-Harrison
at least until the good offices of kindness and education have been fairly tried the contrary conclusion can not be plausibly urged,1889-Harrison
i have altogether rejected the suggestion of a special executive policy for any section of our country,1889-Harrison
it is the duty of the executive to administer and enforce in the methods and by the instrumentalities pointed out and provided by the constitution all the laws enacted by congress,1889-Harrison
these laws are general and their administration should be uniform and equal,1889-Harrison
as a citizen may not elect what laws he will obey neither may the executive eject which he will enforce,1889-Harrison
the duty to obey and to execute embraces the constitution in its entirety and the whole code of laws enacted under it,1889-Harrison
the evil example of permitting individuals corporations or communities to nullify the laws because they cross some selfish or local interest or prejudices is full of danger not only to the nation at large but much more to those who use this pernicious expedient to escape their just obligations or to obtain an unjust advantage over others,1889-Harrison
they will presently themselves be compelled to appeal to the law for protection and those who would use the law as a defense must not deny that use of it to others,1889-Harrison
if our great corporations would more scrupulously observe their legal limitations and duties they would have less cause to complain of the unlawful limitations of their rights or of violent interference with their operations,1889-Harrison
the community that by concert open or secret among its citizens denies to a portion of its members their plain rights under the law has severed the only safe bond of social order and prosperity,1889-Harrison
the evil works from a bad center both ways,1889-Harrison
it demoralizes those who practice it and destroys the faith of those who suffer by it in the efficiency of the law as a safe protector,1889-Harrison
the man in whose breast that faith has been darkened is naturally the subject of dangerous and uncanny suggestions,1889-Harrison
those who use unlawful methods if moved by no higher motive than the selfishness that prompted them may well stop and inquire what is to be the end of this,1889-Harrison
an unlawful expedient can not become a permanent condition of government,1889-Harrison
if the educated and influential classes in a community either practice or connive at the systematic violation of laws that seem to them to cross their convenience what can they expect when the lesson that convenience or a supposed class interest is a sufficient cause for lawlessness has been well learned by the ignorant classes,1889-Harrison
a community where law is the rule of conduct and where courts not mobs execute its penalties is the only attractive field for business investments and honest labor,1889-Harrison
our naturalization laws should be so amended as to make the inquiry into the character and good disposition of persons applying for citizenship more careful and searching,1889-Harrison
our existing laws have been in their administration an unimpressive and often an unintelligible form,1889-Harrison
we accept the man as a citizen without any knowledge of his fitness and he assumes the duties of citizenship without any knowledge as to what they are,1889-Harrison
the privileges of american citizenship are so great and its duties so grave that we may well insist upon a good knowledge of every person applying for citizenship and a good knowledge by him of our institutions,1889-Harrison
we should not cease to be hospitable to immigration but we should cease to be careless as to the character of it,1889-Harrison
there are men of all races even the best whose coming is necessarily a burden upon our public revenues or a threat to social order,1889-Harrison
these should be identified and excluded,1889-Harrison
we have happily maintained a policy of avoiding all interference with european affairs,1889-Harrison
we have been only interested spectators of their contentions in diplomacy and in war ready to use our friendly offices to promote peace but never obtruding our advice and never attempting unfairly to coin the distresses of other powers into commercial advantage to ourselves,1889-Harrison
we have a just right to expect that our european policy will be the american policy of european courts,1889-Harrison
it is so manifestly incompatible with those precautions for our peace and safety which all the great powers habitually observe and enforce in matters affecting them that a shorter waterway between our eastern and western seaboards should be dominated by any european government that we may confidently expect that such a purpose will not be entertained by any friendly power,1889-Harrison
we shall in the future as in the past use every endeavor to maintain and enlarge our friendly relations with all the great powers but they will not expect us to look kindly upon any project that would leave us subject to the dangers of a hostile observation or environment,1889-Harrison
we have not sought to dominate or to absorb any of our weaker neighbors but rather to aid and encourage them to establish free and stable governments resting upon the consent of their own people,1889-Harrison
we have a clear right to expect therefore that no european government will seek to establish colonial dependencies upon the territory of these independent american states,1889-Harrison
that which a sense of justice restrains us from seeking they may be reasonably expected willingly to forego,1889-Harrison
it must not be assumed however that our interests are so exclusively american that our entire inattention to any events that may transpire elsewhere can be taken for granted,1889-Harrison
our citizens domiciled for purposes of trade in all countries and in many of the islands of the sea demand and will have our adequate care in their personal and commercial rights,1889-Harrison
the necessities of our navy require convenient coaling stations and dock and harbor privileges,1889-Harrison
these and other trading privileges we will feel free to obtain only by means that do not in any degree partake of coercion however feeble the government from which we ask such concessions,1889-Harrison
but having fairly obtained them by methods and for purposes entirely consistent with the most friendly disposition toward all other powers our consent will be necessary to any modification or impairment of the concession,1889-Harrison
we shall neither fail to respect the flag of any friendly nation or the just rights of its citizens nor to exact the like treatment for our own,1889-Harrison
calmness justice and consideration should characterize our diplomacy,1889-Harrison
the offices of an intelligent diplomacy or of friendly arbitration in proper cases should be adequate to the peaceful adjustment of all international difficulties,1889-Harrison
by such methods we will make our contribution to the world s peace which no nation values more highly and avoid the opprobrium which must fall upon the nation that ruthlessly breaks it,1889-Harrison
the duty devolved by law upon the president to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint all public officers whose appointment is not otherwise provided for in the constitution or by act of congress has become very burdensome and its wise and efficient discharge full of difficulty,1889-Harrison
the civil list is so large that a personal knowledge of any large number of the applicants is impossible,1889-Harrison
the president must rely upon the representations of others and these are often made inconsiderately and without any just sense of responsibility,1889-Harrison
i have a right i think to insist that those who volunteer or are invited to give advice as to appointments shall exercise consideration and fidelity,1889-Harrison
a high sense of duty and an ambition to improve the service should characterize all public officers,1889-Harrison
there are many ways in which the convenience and comfort of those who have business with our public offices may be promoted by a thoughtful and obliging officer and i shall expect those whom i may appoint to justify their selection by a conspicuous efficiency in the discharge of their duties,1889-Harrison
honorable party service will certainly not be esteemed by me a disqualification for public office but it will in no case be allowed to serve as a shield of official negligence incompetency or delinquency,1889-Harrison
it is entirely creditable to seek public office by proper methods and with proper motives and all applicants will be treated with consideration but i shall need and the heads of departments will need time for inquiry and deliberation,1889-Harrison
persistent importunity will not therefore be the best support of an application for office,1889-Harrison
heads of departments bureaus and all other public officers having any duty connected therewith will be expected to enforce the civil service law fully and without evasion,1889-Harrison
beyond this obvious duty i hope to do something more to advance the reform of the civil service,1889-Harrison
the ideal or even my own ideal i shall probably not attain,1889-Harrison
retrospect will be a safer basis of judgment than promises,1889-Harrison
we shall not however i am sure be able to put our civil service upon a nonpartisan basis until we have secured an incumbency that fair minded men of the opposition will approve for impartiality and integrity,1889-Harrison
as the number of such in the civil list is increased removals from office will diminish,1889-Harrison
while a treasury surplus is not the greatest evil it is a serious evil,1889-Harrison
our revenue should be ample to meet the ordinary annual demands upon our treasury with a sufficient margin for those extraordinary but scarcely less imperative demands which arise now and then,1889-Harrison
expenditure should always be made with economy and only upon public necessity,1889-Harrison
wastefulness profligacy or favoritism in public expenditures is criminal,1889-Harrison
but there is nothing in the condition of our country or of our people to suggest that anything presently necessary to the public prosperity security or honor should be unduly postponed,1889-Harrison
it will be the duty of congress wisely to forecast and estimate these extraordinary demands and having added them to our ordinary expenditures to so adjust our revenue laws that no considerable annual surplus will remain,1889-Harrison
we will fortunately be able to apply to the redemption of the public debt any small and unforeseen excess of revenue,1889-Harrison
this is better than to reduce our income below our necessary expenditures with the resulting choice between another change of our revenue laws and an increase of the public debt,1889-Harrison
it is quite possible i am sure to effect the necessary reduction in our revenues without breaking down our protective tariff or seriously injuring any domestic industry,1889-Harrison
the construction of a sufficient number of modern war ships and of their necessary armament should progress as rapidly as is consistent with care and perfection in plans and workmanship,1889-Harrison
the spirit courage and skill of our naval officers and seamen have many times in our history given to weak ships and inefficient guns a rating greatly beyond that of the naval list,1889-Harrison
that they will again do so upon occasion i do not doubt but they ought not by premeditation or neglect to be left to the risks and exigencies of an unequal combat,1889-Harrison
we should encourage the establishment of american steamship lines,1889-Harrison
the exchanges of commerce demand stated reliable and rapid means of communication and until these are provided the development of our trade with the states lying south of us is impossible,1889-Harrison
our pension laws should give more adequate and discriminating relief to the union soldiers and sailors and to their widows and orphans,1889-Harrison
such occasions as this should remind us that we owe everything to their valor and sacrifice,1889-Harrison
it is a subject of congratulation that there is a near prospect of the admission into the union of the dakotas and montana and washington territories,1889-Harrison
this act of justice has been unreasonably delayed in the case of some of them,1889-Harrison
the people who have settled these territories are intelligent enterprising and patriotic and the accession these new states will add strength to the nation,1889-Harrison
it is due to the settlers in the territories who have availed themselves of the invitations of our land laws to make homes upon the public domain that their titles should be speedily adjusted and their honest entries confirmed by patent,1889-Harrison
it is very gratifying to observe the general interest now being manifested in the reform of our election laws,1889-Harrison
those who have been for years calling attention to the pressing necessity of throwing about the ballot box and about the elector further safeguards in order that our elections might not only be free and pure but might clearly appear to be so will welcome the accession of any who did not so soon discover the need of reform,1889-Harrison
the national congress has not as yet taken control of elections in that case over which the constitution gives it jurisdiction but has accepted and adopted the election laws of the several states provided penalties for their violation and a method of supervision,1889-Harrison
only the inefficiency of the state laws or an unfair partisan administration of them could suggest a departure from this policy,1889-Harrison
it was clearly however in the contemplation of the framers of the constitution that such an exigency might arise and provision was wisely made for it,1889-Harrison
the freedom of the ballot is a condition of our national life and no power vested in congress or in the executive to secure or perpetuate it should remain unused upon occasion,1889-Harrison
the people of all the congressional districts have an equal interest that the election in each shall truly express the views and wishes of a majority of the qualified electors residing within it,1889-Harrison
the results of such elections are not local and the insistence of electors residing in other districts that they shall be pure and free does not savor at all of impertinence,1889-Harrison
if in any of the states the public security is thought to be threatened by ignorance among the electors the obvious remedy is education,1889-Harrison
the sympathy and help of our people will not be withheld from any community struggling with special embarrassments or difficulties connected with the suffrage if the remedies proposed proceed upon lawful lines and are promoted by just and honorable methods,1889-Harrison
how shall those who practice election frauds recover that respect for the sanctity of the ballot which is the first condition and obligation of good citizenship,1889-Harrison
the man who has come to regard the ballot box as a juggler s hat has renounced his allegiance,1889-Harrison
let us exalt patriotism and moderate our party contentions,1889-Harrison
let those who would die for the flag on the field of battle give a better proof of their patriotism and a higher glory to their country by promoting fraternity and justice,1889-Harrison
a party success that is achieved by unfair methods or by practices that partake of revolution is hurtful and evanescent even from a party standpoint,1889-Harrison
we should hold our differing opinions in mutual respect and having submitted them to the arbitrament of the ballot should accept an adverse judgment with the same respect that we would have demanded of our opponents if the decision had been in our favor,1889-Harrison
no other people have a government more worthy of their respect and love or a land so magnificent in extent so pleasant to look upon and so full of generous suggestion to enterprise and labor,1889-Harrison
god has placed upon our head a diadem and has laid at our feet power and wealth beyond definition or calculation,1889-Harrison
but we must not forget that we take these gifts upon the condition that justice and mercy shall hold the reins of power and that the upward avenues of hope shall be free to all the people,1889-Harrison
i do not mistrust the future,1889-Harrison
dangers have been in frequent ambush along our path but we have uncovered and vanquished them all,1889-Harrison
passion has swept some of our communities but only to give us a new demonstration that the great body of our people are stable patriotic and law abiding,1889-Harrison
no political party can long pursue advantage at the expense of public honor or by rude and indecent methods without protest and fatal disaffection in its own body,1889-Harrison
the peaceful agencies of commerce are more fully revealing the necessary unity of all our communities and the increasing intercourse of our people is promoting mutual respect,1889-Harrison
we shall find unalloyed pleasure in the revelation which our next census will make of the swift development of the great resources of some of the states,1889-Harrison
each state will bring its generous contribution to the great aggregate of the nation s increase,1889-Harrison
and when the harvests from the fields the cattle from the hills and the ores of the earth shall have been weighed counted and valued we will turn from them all to crown with the highest honor the state that has most promoted education virtue justice and patriotism among its people,1889-Harrison
my fellow citizens in obedience of the mandate of my countrymen i am about to dedicate myself to their service under the sanction of a solemn oath,1893-Cleveland
deeply moved by the expression of confidence and personal attachment which has called me to this service i am sure my gratitude can make no better return than the pledge i now give before god and these witnesses of unreserved and complete devotion to the interests and welfare of those who have honored me,1893-Cleveland
i deem it fitting on this occasion while indicating the opinion i hold concerning public questions of present importance to also briefly refer to the existence of certain conditions and tendencies among our people which seem to menace the integrity and usefulness of their government,1893-Cleveland
while every american citizen must contemplate with the utmost pride and enthusiasm the growth and expansion of our country the sufficiency of our institutions to stand against the rudest shocks of violence the wonderful thrift and enterprise of our people and the demonstrated superiority of our free government it behooves us to constantly watch for every symptom of insidious infirmity that threatens our national vigor,1893-Cleveland
the strong man who in the confidence of sturdy health courts the sternest activities of life and rejoices in the hardihood of constant labor may still have lurking near his vitals the unheeded disease that dooms him to sudden collapse,1893-Cleveland
it can not be doubted that our stupendous achievements as a people and our country s robust strength have given rise to heedlessness of those laws governing our national health which we can no more evade than human life can escape the laws of god and nature,1893-Cleveland
manifestly nothing is more vital to our supremacy as a nation and to the beneficent purposes of our government than a sound and stable currency,1893-Cleveland
its exposure to degradation should at once arouse to activity the most enlightened statesmanship and the danger of depreciation in the purchasing power of the wages paid to toil should furnish the strongest incentive to prompt and conservative precaution,1893-Cleveland
in dealing with our present embarrassing situation as related to this subject we will be wise if we temper our confidence and faith in our national strength and resources with the frank concession that even these will not permit us to defy with impunity the inexorable laws of finance and trade,1893-Cleveland
at the same time in our efforts to adjust differences of opinion we should be free from intolerance or passion and our judgments should be unmoved by alluring phrases and unvexed by selfish interests,1893-Cleveland
i am confident that such an approach to the subject will result in prudent and effective remedial legislation,1893-Cleveland
in the meantime so far as the executive branch of the government can intervene none of the powers with which it is invested will be withheld when their exercise is deemed necessary to maintain our national credit or avert financial disaster,1893-Cleveland
closely related to the exaggerated confidence in our country s greatness which tends to a disregard of the rules of national safety another danger confronts us not less serious,1893-Cleveland
i refer to the prevalence of a popular disposition to expect from the operation of the government especial and direct individual advantages,1893-Cleveland
the verdict of our voters which condemned the injustice of maintaining protection for protection s sake enjoins upon the people s servants the duty of exposing and destroying the brood of kindred evils which are the unwholesome progeny of paternalism,1893-Cleveland
this is the bane of republican institutions and the constant peril of our government by the people,1893-Cleveland
it degrades to the purposes of wily craft the plan of rule our fathers established and bequeathed to us as an object of our love and veneration,1893-Cleveland
it perverts the patriotic sentiments of our countrymen and tempts them to pitiful calculation of the sordid gain to be derived from their government s maintenance,1893-Cleveland
it undermines the self reliance of our people and substitutes in its place dependence upon governmental favoritism,1893-Cleveland
it stifles the spirit of true americanism and stupefies every ennobling trait of american citizenship,1893-Cleveland
the lessons of paternalism ought to be unlearned and the better lesson taught that while the people should patriotically and cheerfully support their government its functions do not include the support of the people,1893-Cleveland
the acceptance of this principle leads to a refusal of bounties and subsidies which burden the labor and thrift of a portion of our citizens to aid ill advised or languishing enterprises in which they have no concern,1893-Cleveland
it leads also to a challenge of wild and reckless pension expenditure which overleaps the bounds of grateful recognition of patriotic service and prostitutes to vicious uses the people s prompt and generous impulse to aid those disabled in their country s defense,1893-Cleveland
every thoughtful american must realize the importance of checking at its beginning any tendency in public or private station to regard frugality and economy as virtues which we may safely outgrow,1893-Cleveland
the toleration of this idea results in the waste of the people s money by their chosen servants and encourages prodigality and extravagance in the home life of our countrymen,1893-Cleveland
under our scheme of government the waste of public money is a crime against the citizen and the contempt of our people for economy and frugality in their personal affairs deplorably saps the strength and sturdiness of our national character,1893-Cleveland
it is a plain dictate of honesty and good government that public expenditures should be limited by public necessity and that this should be measured by the rules of strict economy and it is equally clear that frugality among the people is the best guaranty of a contented and strong support of free institutions,1893-Cleveland
one mode of the misappropriation of public funds is avoided when appointments to office instead of being the rewards of partisan activity are awarded to those whose efficiency promises a fair return of work for the compensation paid to them,1893-Cleveland
to secure the fitness and competency of appointees to office and remove from political action the demoralizing madness for spoils civil service reform has found a place in our public policy and laws,1893-Cleveland
the benefits already gained through this instrumentality and the further usefulness it promises entitle it to the hearty support and encouragement of all who desire to see our public service well performed or who hope for the elevation of political sentiment and the purification of political methods,1893-Cleveland
the existence of immense aggregations of kindred enterprises and combinations of business interests formed for the purpose of limiting production and fixing prices is inconsistent with the fair field which ought to be open to every independent activity,1893-Cleveland
legitimate strife in business should not be superseded by an enforced concession to the demands of combinations that have the power to destroy nor should the people to be served lose the benefit of cheapness which usually results from wholesome competition,1893-Cleveland
these aggregations and combinations frequently constitute conspiracies against the interests of the people and in all their phases they are unnatural and opposed to our american sense of fairness,1893-Cleveland
to the extent that they can be reached and restrained by federal power the general government should relieve our citizens from their interference and exactions,1893-Cleveland
loyalty to the principles upon which our government rests positively demands that the equality before the law which it guarantees to every citizen should be justly and in good faith conceded in all parts of the land,1893-Cleveland
the enjoyment of this right follows the badge of citizenship wherever found and unimpaired by race or color it appeals for recognition to american manliness and fairness,1893-Cleveland
our relations with the indians located within our border impose upon us responsibilities we can not escape,1893-Cleveland
humanity and consistency require us to treat them with forbearance and in our dealings with them to honestly and considerately regard their rights and interests,1893-Cleveland
every effort should be made to lead them through the paths of civilization and education to self supporting and independent citizenship,1893-Cleveland
in the meantime as the nation s wards they should be promptly defended against the cupidity of designing men and shielded from every influence or temptation that retards their advancement,1893-Cleveland
the people of the united states have decreed that on this day the control of their government in its legislative and executive branches shall be given to a political party pledged in the most positive terms to the accomplishment of tariff reform,1893-Cleveland
they have thus determined in favor of a more just and equitable system of federal taxation,1893-Cleveland
the agents they have chosen to carry out their purposes are bound by their promises not less than by the command of their masters to devote themselves unremittingly to this service,1893-Cleveland
while there should be no surrender of principle our task must be undertaken wisely and without heedless vindictiveness,1893-Cleveland
our mission is not punishment but the rectification of wrong,1893-Cleveland
if in lifting burdens from the daily life of our people we reduce inordinate and unequal advantages too long enjoyed this is but a necessary incident of our return to right and justice,1893-Cleveland
if we exact from unwilling minds acquiescence in the theory of an honest distribution of the fund of the governmental beneficence treasured up for all we but insist upon a principle which underlies our free institutions,1893-Cleveland
when we tear aside the delusions and misconceptions which have blinded our countrymen to their condition under vicious tariff laws we but show them how far they have been led away from the paths of contentment and prosperity,1893-Cleveland
when we proclaim that the necessity for revenue to support the government furnishes the only justification for taxing the people we announce a truth so plain that its denial would seem to indicate the extent to which judgment may be influenced by familiarity with perversions of the taxing power,1893-Cleveland
and when we seek to reinstate the self confidence and business enterprise of our citizens by discrediting an abject dependence upon governmental favor we strive to stimulate those elements of american character which support the hope of american achievement,1893-Cleveland
anxiety for the redemption of the pledges which my party has made and solicitude for the complete justification of the trust the people have reposed in us constrain me to remind those with whom i am to cooperate that we can succeed in doing the work which has been especially set before us only by the most sincere harmonious and disinterested effort,1893-Cleveland
even if insuperable obstacles and opposition prevent the consummation of our task we shall hardly be excused and if failure can be traced to our fault or neglect we may be sure the people will hold us to a swift and exacting accountability,1893-Cleveland
the oath i now take to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states not only impressively defines the great responsibility i assume but suggests obedience to constitutional commands as the rule by which my official conduct must be guided,1893-Cleveland
i shall to the best of my ability and within my sphere of duty preserve the constitution by loyally protecting every grant of federal power it contains by defending all its restraints when attacked by impatience and restlessness and by enforcing its limitations and reservations in favor of the states and the people,1893-Cleveland
fully impressed with the gravity of the duties that confront me and mindful of my weakness i should be appalled if it were my lot to bear unaided the responsibilities which await me,1893-Cleveland
i am however saved from discouragement when i remember that i shall have the support and the counsel and cooperation of wise and patriotic men who will stand at my side in cabinet places or will represent the people in their legislative halls,1893-Cleveland
i find also much comfort in remembering that my countrymen are just and generous and in the assurance that they will not condemn those who by sincere devotion to their service deserve their forbearance and approval,1893-Cleveland
above all i know there is a supreme being who rules the affairs of men and whose goodness and mercy have always followed the american people and i know he will not turn from us now if we humbly and reverently seek his powerful aid,1893-Cleveland
fellow citizens in obedience to the will of the people and in their presence by the authority vested in me by this oath i assume the arduous and responsible duties of president of the united states relying upon the support of my countrymen and invoking the guidance of almighty god,1897-McKinley
our faith teaches that there is no safer reliance than upon the god of our fathers who has so singularly favored the american people in every national trial and who will not forsake us so long as we obey his commandments and walk humbly in his footsteps,1897-McKinley
the responsibilities of the high trust to which i have been called always of grave importance are augmented by the prevailing business conditions entailing idleness upon willing labor and loss to useful enterprises,1897-McKinley
the country is suffering from industrial disturbances from which speedy relief must be had,1897-McKinley
our financial system needs some revision our money is all good now but its value must not further be threatened,1897-McKinley
it should all be put upon an enduring basis not subject to easy attack nor its stability to doubt or dispute,1897-McKinley
our currency should continue under the supervision of the government,1897-McKinley
the several forms of our paper money offer in my judgment a constant embarrassment to the government and a safe balance in the treasury,1897-McKinley
therefore i believe it necessary to devise a system which without diminishing the circulating medium or offering a premium for its contraction will present a remedy for those arrangements which temporary in their nature might well in the years of our prosperity have been displaced by wiser provisions,1897-McKinley
with adequate revenue secured but not until then we can enter upon such changes in our fiscal laws as will while insuring safety and volume to our money no longer impose upon the government the necessity of maintaining so large a gold reserve with its attendant and inevitable temptations to speculation,1897-McKinley
most of our financial laws are the outgrowth of experience and trial and should not be amended without investigation and demonstration of the wisdom of the proposed changes,1897-McKinley
we must be both sure we are right and make haste slowly,1897-McKinley
if therefore congress in its wisdom shall deem it expedient to create a commission to take under early consideration the revision of our coinage banking and currency laws and give them that exhaustive careful and dispassionate examination that their importance demands i shall cordially concur in such action,1897-McKinley
if such power is vested in the president it is my purpose to appoint a commission of prominent well informed citizens of different parties who will command public confidence both on account of their ability and special fitness for the work,1897-McKinley
business experience and public training may thus be combined and the patriotic zeal of the friends of the country be so directed that such a report will be made as to receive the support of all parties and our finances cease to be the subject of mere partisan contention,1897-McKinley
the experiment is at all events worth a trial and in my opinion it can but prove beneficial to the entire country,1897-McKinley
the question of international bimetallism will have early and earnest attention,1897-McKinley
it will be my constant endeavor to secure it by co operation with the other great commercial powers of the world,1897-McKinley
until that condition is realized when the parity between our gold and silver money springs from and is supported by the relative value of the two metals the value of the silver already coined and of that which may hereafter be coined must be kept constantly at par with gold by every resource at our command,1897-McKinley
the credit of the government the integrity of its currency and the inviolability of its obligations must be preserved,1897-McKinley
this was the commanding verdict of the people and it will not be unheeded,1897-McKinley
economy is demanded in every branch of the government at all times but especially in periods like the present of depression in business and distress among the people,1897-McKinley
the severest economy must be observed in all public expenditures and extravagance stopped wherever it is found and prevented wherever in the future it may be developed,1897-McKinley
if the revenues are to remain as now the only relief that can come must be from decreased expenditures,1897-McKinley
but the present must not become the permanent condition of the government,1897-McKinley
it has been our uniform practice to retire not increase our outstanding obligations and this policy must again be resumed and vigorously enforced,1897-McKinley
our revenues should always be large enough to meet with ease and promptness not only our current needs and the principal and interest of the public debt but to make proper and liberal provision for that most deserving body of public creditors the soldiers and sailors and the widows and orphans who are the pensioners of the united states,1897-McKinley
the government should not be permitted to run behind or increase its debt in times like the present,1897-McKinley
suitably to provide against this is the mandate of duty the certain and easy remedy for most of our financial difficulties,1897-McKinley
a deficiency is inevitable so long as the expenditures of the government exceed its receipts,1897-McKinley
it can only be met by loans or an increased revenue,1897-McKinley
while a large annual surplus of revenue may invite waste and extravagance inadequate revenue creates distrust and undermines public and private credit,1897-McKinley
neither should be encouraged,1897-McKinley
between more loans and more revenue there ought to be but one opinion,1897-McKinley
we should have more revenue and that without delay hindrance or postponement,1897-McKinley
a surplus in the treasury created by loans is not a permanent or safe reliance,1897-McKinley
it will suffice while it lasts but it can not last long while the outlays of the government are greater than its receipts as has been the case during the past two years,1897-McKinley
nor must it be forgotten that however much such loans may temporarily relieve the situation the government is still indebted for the amount of the surplus thus accrued which it must ultimately pay while its ability to pay is not strengthened but weakened by a continued deficit,1897-McKinley
loans are imperative in great emergencies to preserve the government or its credit but a failure to supply needed revenue in time of peace for the maintenance of either has no justification,1897-McKinley
the best way for the government to maintain its credit is to pay as it goes not by resorting to loans but by keeping out of debt through an adequate income secured by a system of taxation external or internal or both,1897-McKinley
it is the settled policy of the government pursued from the beginning and practiced by all parties and administrations to raise the bulk of our revenue from taxes upon foreign productions entering the united states for sale and consumption and avoiding for the most part every form of direct taxation except in time of war,1897-McKinley
the country is clearly opposed to any needless additions to the subject of internal taxation and is committed by its latest popular utterance to the system of tariff taxation,1897-McKinley
there can be no misunderstanding either about the principle upon which this tariff taxation shall be levied,1897-McKinley
nothing has ever been made plainer at a general election than that the controlling principle in the raising of revenue from duties on imports is zealous care for american interests and american labor,1897-McKinley
the people have declared that such legislation should be had as will give ample protection and encouragement to the industries and the development of our country,1897-McKinley
it is therefore earnestly hoped and expected that congress will at the earliest practicable moment enact revenue legislation that shall be fair reasonable conservative and just and which while supplying sufficient revenue for public purposes will still be signally beneficial and helpful to every section and every enterprise of the people,1897-McKinley
to this policy we are all of whatever party firmly bound by the voice of the people a power vastly more potential than the expression of any political platform,1897-McKinley
the paramount duty of congress is to stop deficiencies by the restoration of that protective legislation which has always been the firmest prop of the treasury,1897-McKinley
the passage of such a law or laws would strengthen the credit of the government both at home and abroad and go far toward stopping the drain upon the gold reserve held for the redemption of our currency which has been heavy and well nigh constant for several years,1897-McKinley
in the revision of the tariff especial attention should be given to the re enactment and extension of the reciprocity principle of the law of 1890 under which so great a stimulus was given to our foreign trade in new and advantageous markets for our surplus agricultural and manufactured products,1897-McKinley
the brief trial given this legislation amply justifies a further experiment and additional discretionary power in the making of commercial treaties the end in view always to be the opening up of new markets for the products of our country by granting concessions to the products of other lands that we need and cannot produce ourselves and which do not involve any loss of labor to our own people but tend to increase their employment,1897-McKinley
the depression of the past four years has fallen with especial severity upon the great body of toilers of the country and upon none more than the holders of small farms,1897-McKinley
agriculture has languished and labor suffered,1897-McKinley
the revival of manufacturing will be a relief to both,1897-McKinley
no portion of our population is more devoted to the institution of free government nor more loyal in their support while none bears more cheerfully or fully its proper share in the maintenance of the government or is better entitled to its wise and liberal care and protection,1897-McKinley
legislation helpful to producers is beneficial to all,1897-McKinley
the depressed condition of industry on the farm and in the mine and factory has lessened the ability of the people to meet the demands upon them and they rightfully expect that not only a system of revenue shall be established that will secure the largest income with the least burden but that every means will be taken to decrease rather than increase our public expenditures,1897-McKinley
business conditions are not the most promising,1897-McKinley
it will take time to restore the prosperity of former years,1897-McKinley
if we cannot promptly attain it we can resolutely turn our faces in that direction and aid its return by friendly legislation,1897-McKinley
however troublesome the situation may appear congress will not i am sure be found lacking in disposition or ability to relieve it as far as legislation can do so,1897-McKinley
the restoration of confidence and the revival of business which men of all parties so much desire depend more largely upon the prompt energetic and intelligent action of congress than upon any other single agency affecting the situation,1897-McKinley
it is inspiring too to remember that no great emergency in the one hundred and eight years of our eventful national life has ever arisen that has not been met with wisdom and courage by the american people with fidelity to their best interests and highest destiny and to the honor of the american name,1897-McKinley
these years of glorious history have exalted mankind and advanced the cause of freedom throughout the world and immeasurably strengthened the precious free institutions which we enjoy,1897-McKinley
the people love and will sustain these institutions,1897-McKinley
the great essential to our happiness and prosperity is that we adhere to the principles upon which the government was established and insist upon their faithful observance,1897-McKinley
equality of rights must prevail and our laws be always and everywhere respected and obeyed,1897-McKinley
we may have failed in the discharge of our full duty as citizens of the great republic but it is consoling and encouraging to realize that free speech a free press free thought free schools the free and unmolested right of religious liberty and worship and free and fair elections are dearer and more universally enjoyed to day than ever before,1897-McKinley
these guaranties must be sacredly preserved and wisely strengthened,1897-McKinley
the constituted authorities must be cheerfully and vigorously upheld,1897-McKinley
lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the united states courts not mobs must execute the penalties of the law,1897-McKinley
the preservation of public order the right of discussion the integrity of courts and the orderly administration of justice must continue forever the rock of safety upon which our government securely rests,1897-McKinley
one of the lessons taught by the late election which all can rejoice in is that the citizens of the united states are both law respecting and law abiding people not easily swerved from the path of patriotism and honor,1897-McKinley
this is in entire accord with the genius of our institutions and but emphasizes the advantages of inculcating even a greater love for law and order in the future,1897-McKinley
immunity should be granted to none who violate the laws whether individuals corporations or communities and as the constitution imposes upon the president the duty of both its own execution and of the statutes enacted in pursuance of its provisions i shall endeavor carefully to carry them into effect,1897-McKinley
the declaration of the party now restored to power has been in the past that of opposition to all combinations of capital organized in trusts or otherwise to control arbitrarily the condition of trade among our citizens and it has supported such legislation as will prevent the execution of all schemes to oppress the people by undue charges on their supplies or by unjust rates for the transportation of their products to the market,1897-McKinley
this purpose will be steadily pursued both by the enforcement of the laws now in existence and the recommendation and support of such new statutes as may be necessary to carry it into effect,1897-McKinley
our naturalization and immigration laws should be further improved to the constant promotion of a safer a better and a higher citizenship,1897-McKinley
a grave peril to the republic would be a citizenship too ignorant to understand or too vicious to appreciate the great value and beneficence of our institutions and laws and against all who come here to make war upon them our gates must be promptly and tightly closed,1897-McKinley
nor must we be unmindful of the need of improvement among our own citizens but with the zeal of our forefathers encourage the spread of knowledge and free education,1897-McKinley
illiteracy must be banished from the land if we shall attain that high destiny as the foremost of the enlightened nations of the world which under providence we ought to achieve,1897-McKinley
reforms in the civil service must go on but the changes should be real and genuine not perfunctory or prompted by a zeal in behalf of any party simply because it happens to be in power,1897-McKinley
as a member of congress i voted and spoke in favor of the present law and i shall attempt its enforcement in the spirit in which it was enacted,1897-McKinley
the purpose in view was to secure the most efficient service of the best men who would accept appointment under the government retaining faithful and devoted public servants in office but shielding none under the authority of any rule or custom who are inefficient incompetent or unworthy,1897-McKinley
the best interests of the country demand this and the people heartily approve the law wherever and whenever it has been thus administrated,1897-McKinley
congress should give prompt attention to the restoration of our american merchant marine once the pride of the seas in all the great ocean highways of commerce,1897-McKinley
to my mind few more important subjects so imperatively demand its intelligent consideration,1897-McKinley
the united states has progressed with marvelous rapidity in every field of enterprise and endeavor until we have become foremost in nearly all the great lines of inland trade commerce and industry,1897-McKinley
yet while this is true our american merchant marine has been steadily declining until it is now lower both in the percentage of tonnage and the number of vessels employed than it was prior to the civil war,1897-McKinley
commendable progress has been made of late years in the upbuilding of the american navy but we must supplement these efforts by providing as a proper consort for it a merchant marine amply sufficient for our own carrying trade to foreign countries,1897-McKinley
the question is one that appeals both to our business necessities and the patriotic aspirations of a great people,1897-McKinley
it has been the policy of the united states since the foundation of the government to cultivate relations of peace and amity with all the nations of the world and this accords with my conception of our duty now,1897-McKinley
we have cherished the policy of non interference with affairs of foreign governments wisely inaugurated by washington keeping ourselves free from entanglement either as allies or foes content to leave undisturbed with them the settlement of their own domestic concerns,1897-McKinley
it will be our aim to pursue a firm and dignified foreign policy which shall be just impartial ever watchful of our national honor and always insisting upon the enforcement of the lawful rights of american citizens everywhere,1897-McKinley
our diplomacy should seek nothing more and accept nothing less than is due us,1897-McKinley
we want no wars of conquest we must avoid the temptation of territorial aggression,1897-McKinley
war should never be entered upon until every agency of peace has failed peace is preferable to war in almost every contingency,1897-McKinley
arbitration is the true method of settlement of international as well as local or individual differences,1897-McKinley
it was recognized as the best means of adjustment of differences between employers and employees by the forty ninth congress in 1886 and its application was extended to our diplomatic relations by the unanimous concurrence of the senate and house of the fifty first congress in 1890,1897-McKinley
the latter resolution was accepted as the basis of negotiations with us by the british house of commons in 1893 and upon our invitation a treaty of arbitration between the united states and great britain was signed at washington and transmitted to the senate for its ratification in january last,1897-McKinley
since this treaty is clearly the result of our own initiative since it has been recognized as the leading feature of our foreign policy throughout our entire history the adjustment of difficulties by judicial methods rather than force of arms and since it presents to the world the glorious example of reason and peace not passion and war controlling the relations between two of the greatest nations in the world an example certain to be followed by others i respectfully urge the early action of the senate thereon not merely as a matter of policy but as a duty to mankind,1897-McKinley
the importance and moral influence of the ratification of such a treaty can hardly be overestimated in the cause of advancing civilization,1897-McKinley
it may well engage the best thought of the statesmen and people of every country and i cannot but consider it fortunate that it was reserved to the united states to have the leadership in so grand a work,1897-McKinley
it has been the uniform practice of each president to avoid as far as possible the convening of congress in extraordinary session,1897-McKinley
it is an example which under ordinary circumstances and in the absence of a public necessity is to be commended,1897-McKinley
but a failure to convene the representatives of the people in congress in extra session when it involves neglect of a public duty places the responsibility of such neglect upon the executive himself,1897-McKinley
the condition of the public treasury as has been indicated demands the immediate consideration of congress,1897-McKinley
it alone has the power to provide revenues for the government,1897-McKinley
not to convene it under such circumstances i can view in no other sense than the neglect of a plain duty,1897-McKinley
i do not sympathize with the sentiment that congress in session is dangerous to our general business interests,1897-McKinley
its members are the agents of the people and their presence at the seat of government in the execution of the sovereign will should not operate as an injury but a benefit,1897-McKinley
there could be no better time to put the government upon a sound financial and economic basis than now,1897-McKinley
the people have only recently voted that this should be done and nothing is more binding upon the agents of their will than the obligation of immediate action,1897-McKinley
it has always seemed to me that the postponement of the meeting of congress until more than a year after it has been chosen deprived congress too often of the inspiration of the popular will and the country of the corresponding benefits,1897-McKinley
it is evident therefore that to postpone action in the presence of so great a necessity would be unwise on the part of the executive because unjust to the interests of the people,1897-McKinley
our action now will be freer from mere partisan consideration than if the question of tariff revision was postponed until the regular session of congress,1897-McKinley
we are nearly two years from a congressional election and politics cannot so greatly distract us as if such contest was immediately pending,1897-McKinley
we can approach the problem calmly and patriotically without fearing its effect upon an early election,1897-McKinley
our fellow citizens who may disagree with us upon the character of this legislation prefer to have the question settled now even against their preconceived views and perhaps settled so reasonably as i trust and believe it will be as to insure great permanence than to have further uncertainty menacing the vast and varied business interests of the united states,1897-McKinley
again whatever action congress may take will be given a fair opportunity for trial before the people are called to pass judgment upon it and this i consider a great essential to the rightful and lasting settlement of the question,1897-McKinley
in view of these considerations i shall deem it my duty as president to convene congress in extraordinary session on monday the 15th day of march 1897,1897-McKinley
in conclusion i congratulate the country upon the fraternal spirit of the people and the manifestations of good will everywhere so apparent,1897-McKinley
the recent election not only most fortunately demonstrated the obliteration of sectional or geographical lines but to some extent also the prejudices which for years have distracted our councils and marred our true greatness as a nation,1897-McKinley
the triumph of the people whose verdict is carried into effect today is not the triumph of one section nor wholly of one party but of all sections and all the people,1897-McKinley
the north and the south no longer divide on the old lines but upon principles and policies and in this fact surely every lover of the country can find cause for true felicitation,1897-McKinley
let us rejoice in and cultivate this spirit it is ennobling and will be both a gain and a blessing to our beloved country,1897-McKinley
it will be my constant aim to do nothing and permit nothing to be done that will arrest or disturb this growing sentiment of unity and cooperation this revival of esteem and affiliation which now animates so many thousands in both the old antagonistic sections but i shall cheerfully do everything possible to promote and increase it,1897-McKinley
let me again repeat the words of the oath administered by the chief justice which in their respective spheres so far as applicable i would have all my countrymen observe i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states,1897-McKinley
this is the obligation i have reverently taken before the lord most high,1897-McKinley
to keep it will be my single purpose my constant prayer and i shall confidently rely upon the forbearance and assistance of all the people in the discharge of my solemn responsibilities,1897-McKinley
my fellow citizens when we assembled here on the 4th of march 1897 there was great anxiety with regard to our currency and credit,1901-McKinley
none exists now,1901-McKinley
then our treasury receipts were inadequate to meet the current obligations of the government,1901-McKinley
now they are sufficient for all public needs and we have a surplus instead of a deficit,1901-McKinley
then i felt constrained to convene the congress in extraordinary session to devise revenues to pay the ordinary expenses of the government,1901-McKinley
now i have the satisfaction to announce that the congress just closed has reduced taxation in the sum of 41 000 000,1901-McKinley
then there was deep solicitude because of the long depression in our manufacturing mining agricultural and mercantile industries and the consequent distress of our laboring population,1901-McKinley
now every avenue of production is crowded with activity labor is well employed and american products find good markets at home and abroad,1901-McKinley
our diversified productions however are increasing in such unprecedented volume as to admonish us of the necessity of still further enlarging our foreign markets by broader commercial relations,1901-McKinley
for this purpose reciprocal trade arrangements with other nations should in liberal spirit be carefully cultivated and promoted,1901-McKinley
the national verdict of 1896 has for the most part been executed,1901-McKinley
whatever remains unfulfilled is a continuing obligation resting with undiminished force upon the executive and the congress,1901-McKinley
but fortunate as our condition is its permanence can only be assured by sound business methods and strict economy in national administration and legislation,1901-McKinley
we should not permit our great prosperity to lead us to reckless ventures in business or profligacy in public expenditures,1901-McKinley
while the congress determines the objects and the sum of appropriations the officials of the executive departments are responsible for honest and faithful disbursement and it should be their constant care to avoid waste and extravagance,1901-McKinley
honesty capacity and industry are nowhere more indispensable than in public employment,1901-McKinley
these should be fundamental requisites to original appointment and the surest guaranties against removal,1901-McKinley
four years ago we stood on the brink of war without the people knowing it and without any preparation or effort at preparation for the impending peril,1901-McKinley
i did all that in honor could be done to avert the war but without avail,1901-McKinley
it became inevitable and the congress at its first regular session without party division provided money in anticipation of the crisis and in preparation to meet it,1901-McKinley
it came,1901-McKinley
the result was signally favorable to american arms and in the highest degree honorable to the government,1901-McKinley
it imposed upon us obligations from which we cannot escape and from which it would be dishonorable to seek escape,1901-McKinley
we are now at peace with the world and it is my fervent prayer that if differences arise between us and other powers they may be settled by peaceful arbitration and that hereafter we may be spared the horrors of war,1901-McKinley
intrusted by the people for a second time with the office of president i enter upon its administration appreciating the great responsibilities which attach to this renewed honor and commission promising unreserved devotion on my part to their faithful discharge and reverently invoking for my guidance the direction and favor of almighty god,1901-McKinley
i should shrink from the duties this day assumed if i did not feel that in their performance i should have the co operation of the wise and patriotic men of all parties,1901-McKinley
it encourages me for the great task which i now undertake to believe that those who voluntarily committed to me the trust imposed upon the chief executive of the republic will give to me generous support in my duties to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states and to care that the laws be faithfully executed,1901-McKinley
the national purpose is indicated through a national election,1901-McKinley
it is the constitutional method of ascertaining the public will,1901-McKinley
when once it is registered it is a law to us all and faithful observance should follow its decrees,1901-McKinley
strong hearts and helpful hands are needed and fortunately we have them in every part of our beloved country,1901-McKinley
we are reunited,1901-McKinley
sectionalism has disappeared,1901-McKinley
division on public questions can no longer be traced by the war maps of 1861,1901-McKinley
these old differences less and less disturb the judgment,1901-McKinley
existing problems demand the thought and quicken the conscience of the country and the responsibility for their presence as well as for their righteous settlement no more upon me than upon you,1901-McKinley
there are some national questions in the solution of which patriotism should exclude partisanship,1901-McKinley
magnifying their difficulties will not take them off our hands nor facilitate their adjustment,1901-McKinley
distrust of the capacity integrity and high purposes of the american people will not be an inspiring theme for future political contests,1901-McKinley
dark pictures and gloomy forebodings are worse than useless,1901-McKinley
these only becloud they do not help to point the way of safety and honor,1901-McKinley
hope maketh not ashamed,1901-McKinley
the prophets of evil were not the builders of the republic nor in its crises since have they saved or served it,1901-McKinley
the faith of the fathers was a mighty force in its creation and the faith of their descendants has wrought its progress and furnished its defenders,1901-McKinley
they are obstructionists who despair and who would destroy confidence in the ability of our people to solve wisely and for civilization the mighty problems resting upon them,1901-McKinley
the american people intrenched in freedom at home take their love for it with them wherever they go and they reject as mistaken and unworthy the doctrine that we lose our own liberties by securing the enduring foundations of liberty to others,1901-McKinley
our institutions will not deteriorate by extension and our sense of justice will not abate under tropic suns in distant seas,1901-McKinley
as heretofore so hereafter will the nation demonstrate its fitness to administer any new estate which events devolve upon it and in the fear of god will take occasion by the hand and make the bounds of freedom wider yet,1901-McKinley
if there are those among us who would make our way more difficult we must not be disheartened but the more earnestly dedicate ourselves to the task upon which we have rightly entered,1901-McKinley
the path of progress is seldom smooth,1901-McKinley
new things are often found hard to do,1901-McKinley
our fathers found them so,1901-McKinley
we find them so,1901-McKinley
they are inconvenient,1901-McKinley
they cost us something,1901-McKinley
but are we not made better for the effort and sacrifice and are not those we serve lifted up and blessed,1901-McKinley
we will be consoled to with the fact that opposition has confronted every onward movement of the republic from its opening hour until now but without success,1901-McKinley
the republic has marched on and on and its step has exalted freedom and humanity,1901-McKinley
we are undergoing the same ordeal as did our predecessors nearly a century ago,1901-McKinley
we are following the course they blazed,1901-McKinley
they triumphed,1901-McKinley
will their successors falter and plead organic impotency in the nation,1901-McKinley
surely after 125 years of achievement for mankind we will not now surrender our equality with other powers on matters fundamental and essential to nationality,1901-McKinley
with no such purpose was the nation created,1901-McKinley
in no such spirit has it developed its full and independent sovereignty,1901-McKinley
we adhere to the principle of equality among ourselves and by no act of ours will we assign to ourselves a subordinate rank in the family of nations,1901-McKinley
my fellow citizens the public events of the past four years have gone into history,1901-McKinley
they are too near to justify recital,1901-McKinley
some of them were unforeseen many of them momentous and far reaching in their consequences to ourselves and our relations with the rest of the world,1901-McKinley
the part which the united states bore so honorably in the thrilling scenes in china while new to american life has been in harmony with its true spirit and best traditions and in dealing with the results its policy will be that of moderation and fairness,1901-McKinley
we face at this moment a most important question that of the future relations of the united states and cuba,1901-McKinley
with our near neighbors we must remain close friends,1901-McKinley
the declaration of the purposes of this government in the resolution of april 20 1898 must be made good,1901-McKinley
ever since the evacuation of the island by the army of spain the executive with all practicable speed has been assisting its people in the successive steps necessary to the establishment of a free and independent government prepared to assume and perform the obligations of international law which now rest upon the united states under the treaty of paris,1901-McKinley
the convention elected by the people to frame a constitution is approaching the completion of its labors,1901-McKinley
the transfer of american control to the new government is of such great importance involving an obligation resulting from our intervention and the treaty of peace that i am glad to be advised by the recent act of congress of the policy which the legislative branch of the government deems essential to the best interests of cuba and the united states,1901-McKinley
the principles which led to our intervention require that the fundamental law upon which the new government rests should be adapted to secure a government capable of performing the duties and discharging the functions of a separate nation of observing its international obligations of protecting life and property insuring order safety and liberty and conforming to the established and historical policy of the united states in its relation to cuba,1901-McKinley
the peace which we are pledged to leave to the cuban people must carry with it the guaranties of permanence,1901-McKinley
we became sponsors for the pacification of the island and we remain accountable to the cubans no less than to our own country and people for the reconstruction of cuba as a free commonwealth on abiding foundations of right justice liberty and assured order,1901-McKinley
our enfranchisement of the people will not be completed until free cuba shall be a reality not a name a perfect entity not a hasty experiment bearing within itself the elements of failure,1901-McKinley
while the treaty of peace with spain was ratified on the 6th of february 1899 and ratifications were exchanged nearly two years ago the congress has indicated no form of government for the philippine islands,1901-McKinley
it has however provided an army to enable the executive to suppress insurrection restore peace give security to the inhabitants and establish the authority of the united states throughout the archipelago,1901-McKinley
it has authorized the organization of native troops as auxiliary to the regular force,1901-McKinley
it has been advised from time to time of the acts of the military and naval officers in the islands of my action in appointing civil commissions of the instructions with which they were charged of their duties and powers of their recommendations and of their several acts under executive commission together with the very complete general information they have submitted,1901-McKinley
these reports fully set forth the conditions past and present in the islands and the instructions clearly show the principles which will guide the executive until the congress shall as it is required to do by the treaty determine the civil rights and political status of the native inhabitants,1901-McKinley
the congress having added the sanction of its authority to the powers already possessed and exercised by the executive under the constitution thereby leaving with the executive the responsibility for the government of the philippines i shall continue the efforts already begun until order shall be restored throughout the islands and as fast as conditions permit will establish local governments in the formation of which the full co operation of the people has been already invited and when established will encourage the people to administer them,1901-McKinley
the settled purpose long ago proclaimed to afford the inhabitants of the islands self government as fast as they were ready for it will be pursued with earnestness and fidelity,1901-McKinley
already something has been accomplished in this direction,1901-McKinley
the government s representatives civil and military are doing faithful and noble work in their mission of emancipation and merit the approval and support of their countrymen,1901-McKinley
the most liberal terms of amnesty have already been communicated to the insurgents and the way is still open for those who have raised their arms against the government for honorable submission to its authority,1901-McKinley
our countrymen should not be deceived,1901-McKinley
we are not waging war against the inhabitants of the philippine islands,1901-McKinley
a portion of them are making war against the united states,1901-McKinley
by far the greater part of the inhabitants recognize american sovereignty and welcome it as a guaranty of order and of security for life property liberty freedom of conscience and the pursuit of happiness,1901-McKinley
to them full protection will be given,1901-McKinley
they shall not be abandoned,1901-McKinley
we will not leave the destiny of the loyal millions the islands to the disloyal thousands who are in rebellion against the united states,1901-McKinley
order under civil institutions will come as soon as those who now break the peace shall keep it,1901-McKinley
force will not be needed or used when those who make war against us shall make it no more,1901-McKinley
may it end without further bloodshed and there be ushered in the reign of peace to be made permanent by a government of liberty under law,1901-McKinley
my fellow citizens no people on earth have more cause to be thankful than ours and this is said reverently in no spirit of boastfulness in our own strength but with gratitude to the giver of good who has blessed us with the conditions which have enabled us to achieve so large a measure of well being and of happiness,1905-Roosevelt
to us as a people it has been granted to lay the foundations of our national life in a new continent,1905-Roosevelt
we are the heirs of the ages and yet we have had to pay few of the penalties which in old countries are exacted by the dead hand of a bygone civilization,1905-Roosevelt
we have not been obliged to fight for our existence against any alien race and yet our life has called for the vigor and effort without which the manlier and hardier virtues wither away,1905-Roosevelt
under such conditions it would be our own fault if we failed and the success which we have had in the past the success which we confidently believe the future will bring should cause in us no feeling of vainglory but rather a deep and abiding realization of all which life has offered us a full acknowledgment of the responsibility which is ours and a fixed determination to show that under a free government a mighty people can thrive best alike as regards the things of the body and the things of the soul,1905-Roosevelt
much has been given us and much will rightfully be expected from us,1905-Roosevelt
we have duties to others and duties to ourselves and we can shirk neither,1905-Roosevelt
we have become a great nation forced by the fact of its greatness into relations with the other nations of the earth and we must behave as beseems a people with such responsibilities,1905-Roosevelt
toward all other nations large and small our attitude must be one of cordial and sincere friendship,1905-Roosevelt
we must show not only in our words but in our deeds that we are earnestly desirous of securing their good will by acting toward them in a spirit of just and generous recognition of all their rights,1905-Roosevelt
but justice and generosity in a nation as in an individual count most when shown not by the weak but by the strong,1905-Roosevelt
while ever careful to refrain from wrongdoing others we must be no less insistent that we are not wronged ourselves,1905-Roosevelt
we wish peace but we wish the peace of justice the peace of righteousness,1905-Roosevelt
we wish it because we think it is right and not because we are afraid,1905-Roosevelt
no weak nation that acts manfully and justly should ever have cause to fear us and no strong power should ever be able to single us out as a subject for insolent aggression,1905-Roosevelt
our relations with the other powers of the world are important but still more important are our relations among ourselves,1905-Roosevelt
such growth in wealth in population and in power as this nation has seen during the century and a quarter of its national life is inevitably accompanied by a like growth in the problems which are ever before every nation that rises to greatness,1905-Roosevelt
power invariably means both responsibility and danger,1905-Roosevelt
our forefathers faced certain perils which we have outgrown,1905-Roosevelt
we now face other perils the very existence of which it was impossible that they should foresee,1905-Roosevelt
modern life is both complex and intense and the tremendous changes wrought by the extraordinary industrial development of the last half century are felt in every fiber of our social and political being,1905-Roosevelt
never before have men tried so vast and formidable an experiment as that of administering the affairs of a continent under the forms of a democratic republic,1905-Roosevelt
the conditions which have told for our marvelous material well being which have developed to a very high degree our energy self reliance and individual initiative have also brought the care and anxiety inseparable from the accumulation of great wealth in industrial centers,1905-Roosevelt
upon the success of our experiment much depends not only as regards our own welfare but as regards the welfare of mankind,1905-Roosevelt
if we fail the cause of free self government throughout the world will rock to its foundations and therefore our responsibility is heavy to ourselves to the world as it is today and to the generations yet unborn,1905-Roosevelt
there is no good reason why we should fear the future but there is every reason why we should face it seriously neither hiding from ourselves the gravity of the problems before us nor fearing to approach these problems with the unbending unflinching purpose to solve them aright,1905-Roosevelt
yet after all though the problems are new though the tasks set before us differ from the tasks set before our fathers who founded and preserved this republic the spirit in which these tasks must be undertaken and these problems faced if our duty is to be well done remains essentially unchanged,1905-Roosevelt
we know that self government is difficult,1905-Roosevelt
we know that no people needs such high traits of character as that people which seeks to govern its affairs aright through the freely expressed will of the freemen who compose it,1905-Roosevelt
but we have faith that we shall not prove false to the memories of the men of the mighty past,1905-Roosevelt
they did their work they left us the splendid heritage we now enjoy,1905-Roosevelt
we in our turn have an assured confidence that we shall be able to leave this heritage unwasted and enlarged to our children and our children s children,1905-Roosevelt
to do so we must show not merely in great crises but in the everyday affairs of life the qualities of practical intelligence of courage of hardihood and endurance and above all the power of devotion to a lofty ideal which made great the men who founded this republic in the days of washington which made great the men who preserved this republic in the days of abraham lincoln,1905-Roosevelt
my fellow citizens anyone who has taken the oath i have just taken must feel a heavy weight of responsibility,1909-Taft
if not he has no conception of the powers and duties of the office upon which he is about to enter or he is lacking in a proper sense of the obligation which the oath imposes,1909-Taft
the office of an inaugural address is to give a summary outline of the main policies of the new administration so far as they can be anticipated,1909-Taft
i have had the honor to be one of the advisers of my distinguished predecessor and as such to hold up his hands in the reforms he has initiated,1909-Taft
i should be untrue to myself to my promises and to the declarations of the party platform upon which i was elected to office if i did not make the maintenance and enforcement of those reforms a most important feature of my administration,1909-Taft
they were directed to the suppression of the lawlessness and abuses of power of the great combinations of capital invested in railroads and in industrial enterprises carrying on interstate commerce,1909-Taft
the steps which my predecessor took and the legislation passed on his recommendation have accomplished much have caused a general halt in the vicious policies which created popular alarm and have brought about in the business affected a much higher regard for existing law,1909-Taft
to render the reforms lasting however and to secure at the same time freedom from alarm on the part of those pursuing proper and progressive business methods further legislative and executive action are needed,1909-Taft
relief of the railroads from certain restrictions of the antitrust law have been urged by my predecessor and will be urged by me,1909-Taft
on the other hand the administration is pledged to legislation looking to a proper federal supervision and restriction to prevent excessive issues of bonds and stock by companies owning and operating interstate commerce railroads,1909-Taft
then too a reorganization of the department of justice of the bureau of corporations in the department of commerce and labor and of the interstate commerce commission looking to effective cooperation of these agencies is needed to secure a more rapid and certain enforcement of the laws affecting interstate railroads and industrial combinations,1909-Taft
i hope to be able to submit at the first regular session of the incoming congress in december next definite suggestions in respect to the needed amendments to the antitrust and the interstate commerce law and the changes required in the executive departments concerned in their enforcement,1909-Taft
it is believed that with the changes to be recommended american business can be assured of that measure of stability and certainty in respect to those things that may be done and those that are prohibited which is essential to the life and growth of all business,1909-Taft
such a plan must include the right of the people to avail themselves of those methods of combining capital and effort deemed necessary to reach the highest degree of economic efficiency at the same time differentiating between combinations based upon legitimate economic reasons and those formed with the intent of creating monopolies and artificially controlling prices,1909-Taft
the work of formulating into practical shape such changes is creative word of the highest order and requires all the deliberation possible in the interval,1909-Taft
i believe that the amendments to be proposed are just as necessary in the protection of legitimate business as in the clinching of the reforms which properly bear the name of my predecessor,1909-Taft
a matter of most pressing importance is the revision of the tariff,1909-Taft
in accordance with the promises of the platform upon which i was elected i shall call congress into extra session to meet on the 15th day of march in order that consideration may be at once given to a bill revising the dingley act,1909-Taft
this should secure an adequate revenue and adjust the duties in such a manner as to afford to labor and to all industries in this country whether of the farm mine or factory protection by tariff equal to the difference between the cost of production abroad and the cost of production here and have a provision which shall put into force upon executive determination of certain facts a higher or maximum tariff against those countries whose trade policy toward us equitably requires such discrimination,1909-Taft
it is thought that there has been such a change in conditions since the enactment of the dingley act drafted on a similarly protective principle that the measure of the tariff above stated will permit the reduction of rates in certain schedules and will require the advancement of few if any,1909-Taft
the proposal to revise the tariff made in such an authoritative way as to lead the business community to count upon it necessarily halts all those branches of business directly affected and as these are most important it disturbs the whole business of the country,1909-Taft
it is imperatively necessary therefore that a tariff bill be drawn in good faith in accordance with promises made before the election by the party in power and as promptly passed as due consideration will permit,1909-Taft
it is not that the tariff is more important in the long run than the perfecting of the reforms in respect to antitrust legislation and interstate commerce regulation but the need for action when the revision of the tariff has been determined upon is more immediate to avoid embarrassment of business,1909-Taft
to secure the needed speed in the passage of the tariff bill it would seem wise to attempt no other legislation at the extra session,1909-Taft
i venture this as a suggestion only for the course to be taken by congress upon the call of the executive is wholly within its discretion,1909-Taft
in the mailing of a tariff bill the prime motive is taxation and the securing thereby of a revenue,1909-Taft
due largely to the business depression which followed the financial panic of 1907 the revenue from customs and other sources has decreased to such an extent that the expenditures for the current fiscal year will exceed the receipts by 100 000 000,1909-Taft
it is imperative that such a deficit shall not continue and the framers of the tariff bill must of course have in mind the total revenues likely to be produced by it and so arrange the duties as to secure an adequate income,1909-Taft
should it be impossible to do so by import duties new kinds of taxation must be adopted and among these i recommend a graduated inheritance tax as correct in principle and as certain and easy of collection,1909-Taft
the obligation on the part of those responsible for the expenditures made to carry on the government to be as economical as possible and to make the burden of taxation as light as possible is plain and should be affirmed in every declaration of government policy,1909-Taft
this is especially true when we are face to face with a heavy deficit,1909-Taft
but when the desire to win the popular approval leads to the cutting off of expenditures really needed t make the government effective and to enable it to accomplish its proper objects the result is as much to be condemned as the waste of government funds in unnecessary expenditure,1909-Taft
the scope of a modern government in what it can and ought to accomplish for its people has been widened far beyond the principles laid down by the old laissez faire school of political writers and this widening has met popular approval,1909-Taft
in the department of agriculture the use of scientific experiments on a large scale and the spread of information derived from them for the improvement of general agriculture must go on,1909-Taft
the importance of supervising business of great railways and industrial combinations and the necessary investigation and prosecution of unlawful business methods are another necessary tax upon government which did not exist half a century ago,1909-Taft
the putting into force of laws which shall secure the conservation of our resources so far as they may be within the jurisdiction of the federal government including the most important work of saving and restoring our forests and the great improvement of waterways are all proper government functions which must involve large expenditure if properly performed,1909-Taft
while some of them like the reclamation of arid lands are made to pay for themselves others are of such an indirect benefit that this cannot be expected of them,1909-Taft
a permanent improvement like the panama canal should be treated as a distinct enterprise and should be paid for by the proceeds of bonds the issue of which will distribute its cost between the present and future generations in accordance with the benefits derived,1909-Taft
it may well be submitted to the serious consideration of congress whether the deepening and control of the channel of a great river system like that of the ohio or of the mississippi when definite and practical plans for the enterprise have been approved and determined upon should not be provided for in the same way,1909-Taft
then too there are expenditures of government absolutely necessary if our country is to maintain its proper place among the nations of the world and is to exercise its proper influence in defense of its own trade interests in the maintenance of traditional american policy against the colonization of european monarchies in this hemisphere and in the promotion of peace and international morality,1909-Taft
i refer to the cost of maintaining a proper army a proper navy and suitable fortifications upon the mainland of the united states and in its dependencies,1909-Taft
we should have an army so organized and so officered as to be capable in time of emergency in cooperation with the national militia and under the provisions of a proper national volunteer law rapidly to expand into a force sufficient to resist all probable invasion from abroad and to furnish a respectable expeditionary force if necessary in the maintenance of our traditional american policy which bears the name of president monroe,1909-Taft
our fortifications are yet in a state of only partial completeness and the number of men to man them is insufficient,1909-Taft
in a few years however the usual annual appropriations for our coast defenses both on the mainland and in the dependencies will make them sufficient to resist all direct attack and by that time we may hope that the men to man them will be provided as a necessary adjunct,1909-Taft
the distance of our shores from europe and asia of course reduces the necessity for maintaining under arms a great army but it does not take away the requirement of mere prudence that we should have an army sufficiently large and so constituted as to form a nucleus out of which a suitable force can quickly grow,1909-Taft
what has been said of the army may be affirmed in even a more emphatic way of the navy,1909-Taft
a modern navy can not be improvised,1909-Taft
it must be built and in existence when the emergency arises which calls for its use and operation,1909-Taft
my distinguished predecessor has in many speeches and messages set out with great force and striking language the necessity for maintaining a strong navy commensurate with the coast line the governmental resources and the foreign trade of our nation and i wish to reiterate all the reasons which he has presented in favor of the policy of maintaining a strong navy as the best conservator of our peace with other nations and the best means of securing respect for the assertion of our rights the defense of our interests and the exercise of our influence in international matters,1909-Taft
our international policy is always to promote peace,1909-Taft
we shall enter into any war with a full consciousness of the awful consequences that it always entails whether successful or not and we of course shall make every effort consistent with national honor and the highest national interest to avoid a resort to arms,1909-Taft
we favor every instrumentality like that of the hague tribunal and arbitration treaties made with a view to its use in all international controversies in order to maintain peace and to avoid war,1909-Taft
but we should be blind to existing conditions and should allow ourselves to become foolish idealists if we did not realize that with all the nations of the world armed and prepared for war we must be ourselves in a similar condition in order to prevent other nations from taking advantage of us and of our inability to defend our interests and assert our rights with a strong hand,1909-Taft
in the international controversies that are likely to arise in the orient growing out of the question of the open door and other issues the united states can maintain her interests intact and can secure respect for her just demands,1909-Taft
she will not be able to do so however if it is understood that she never intends to back up her assertion of right and her defense of her interest by anything but mere verbal protest and diplomatic note,1909-Taft
for these reasons the expenses of the army and navy and of coast defenses should always be considered as something which the government must pay for and they should not be cut off through mere consideration of economy,1909-Taft
our government is able to afford a suitable army and a suitable navy,1909-Taft
it may maintain them without the slightest danger to the republic or the cause of free institutions and fear of additional taxation ought not to change a proper policy in this regard,1909-Taft
the policy of the united states in the spanish war and since has given it a position of influence among the nations that it never had before and should be constantly exerted to securing to its bona fide citizens whether native or naturalized respect for them as such in foreign countries,1909-Taft
we should make every effort to prevent humiliating and degrading prohibition against any of our citizens wishing temporarily to sojourn in foreign countries because of race or religion,1909-Taft
the admission of asiatic immigrants who cannot be amalgamated with our population has been made the subject either of prohibitory clauses in our treaties and statutes or of strict administrative regulation secured by diplomatic negotiation,1909-Taft
i sincerely hope that we may continue to minimize the evils likely to arise from such immigration without unnecessary friction and by mutual concessions between self respecting governments,1909-Taft
meantime we must take every precaution to prevent or failing that to punish outbursts of race feeling among our people against foreigners of whatever nationality who have by our grant a treaty right to pursue lawful business here and to be protected against lawless assault or injury,1909-Taft
this leads me to point out a serious defect in the present federal jurisdiction which ought to be remedied at once,1909-Taft
having assured to other countries by treaty the protection of our laws for such of their subjects or citizens as we permit to come within our jurisdiction we now leave to a state or a city not under the control of the federal government the duty of performing our international obligations in this respect,1909-Taft
by proper legislation we may and ought to place in the hands of the federal executive the means of enforcing the treaty rights of such aliens in the courts of the federal government,1909-Taft
it puts our government in a pusillanimous position to make definite engagements to protect aliens and then to excuse the failure to perform those engagements by an explanation that the duty to keep them is in states or cities not within our control,1909-Taft
if we would promise we must put ourselves in a position to perform our promise,1909-Taft
we cannot permit the possible failure of justice due to local prejudice in any state or municipal government to expose us to the risk of a war which might be avoided if federal jurisdiction was asserted by suitable legislation by congress and carried out by proper proceedings instituted by the executive in the courts of the national government,1909-Taft
one of the reforms to be carried out during the incoming administration is a change of our monetary and banking laws so as to secure greater elasticity in the forms of currency available for trade and to prevent the limitations of law from operating to increase the embarrassment of a financial panic,1909-Taft
the monetary commission lately appointed is giving full consideration to existing conditions and to all proposed remedies and will doubtless suggest one that will meet the requirements of business and of public interest,1909-Taft
we may hope that the report will embody neither the narrow dew of those who believe that the sole purpose of the new system should be to secure a large return on banking capital or of those who would have greater expansion of currency with little regard to provisions for its immediate redemption or ultimate security,1909-Taft
there is no subject of economic discussion so intricate and so likely to evoke differing views and dogmatic statements as this one,1909-Taft
the commission in studying the general influence of currency on business and of business on currency have wisely extended their investigations in european banking and monetary methods,1909-Taft
the information that they have derived from such experts as they have found abroad will undoubtedly be found helpful in the solution of the difficult problem they have in hand,1909-Taft
the incoming congress should promptly fulfill the promise of the republican platform and pass a proper postal savings bank bill,1909-Taft
it will not be unwise or excessive paternalism,1909-Taft
the promise to repay by the government will furnish an inducement to savings deposits which private enterprise can not supply and at such a low rate of interest as not to withdraw custom from existing banks,1909-Taft
it will substantially increase the funds available for investment as capital in useful enterprises,1909-Taft
it will furnish absolute security which makes the proposed scheme of government guaranty of deposits so alluring without its pernicious results,1909-Taft
i sincerely hope that the incoming congress will be alive as it should be to the importance of our foreign trade and of encouraging it in every way feasible,1909-Taft
the possibility of increasing this trade in the orient in the philippines and in south america are known to everyone who has given the matter attention,1909-Taft
the direct effect of free trade between this country and the philippines will be marked upon our sales of cottons agricultural machinery and other manufactures,1909-Taft
the necessity of the establishment of direct lines of steamers between north and south america has been brought to the attention of congress by my predecessor and by mr root before and after his noteworthy visit to that continent and i sincerely hope that congress may be induced to see the wisdom of a tentative effort to establish such lines by the use of mail subsidies,1909-Taft
the importance of the part which the departments of agriculture and of commerce and labor may play in ridding the markets of europe of prohibitions and discriminations against the importation of our products is fully understood and it is hoped that the use of the maximum and minimum feature of our tariff law to be soon passed will be effective to remove many of those restrictions,1909-Taft
the panama canal will have a most important bearing upon the trade between the eastern and far western sections of our country and will greatly increase the facilities for transportation between the eastern and the western seaboard and may possibly revolutionize the transcontinental rates with respect to bulky merchandise,1909-Taft
it will also have a most beneficial effect to increase the trade between the eastern seaboard of the united states and the western coast of south america and indeed with some of the important ports on the east coast of south america reached by rail from the west coast,1909-Taft
the work on the canal is making most satisfactory progress,1909-Taft
the type of the canal as a lock canal was fixed by congress after a full consideration of the conflicting reports of the majority and minority of the consulting board and after the recommendation of the war department and the executive upon those reports,1909-Taft
recent suggestion that something had occurred on the isthmus to make the lock type of the canal less feasible than it was supposed to be when the reports were made and the policy determined on led to a visit to the isthmus of a board of competent engineers to examine the gatun dam and locks which are the key of the lock type,1909-Taft
the report of that board shows nothing has occurred in the nature of newly revealed evidence which should change the views once formed in the original discussion,1909-Taft
the construction will go on under a most effective organization controlled by colonel goethals and his fellow army engineers associated with him and will certainly be completed early in the next administration if not before,1909-Taft
some type of canal must be constructed,1909-Taft
the lock type has been selected,1909-Taft
we are all in favor of having it built as promptly as possible,1909-Taft
we must not now therefore keep up a fire in the rear of the agents whom we have authorized to do our work on the isthmus,1909-Taft
we must hold up their hands and speaking for the incoming administration i wish to say that i propose to devote all the energy possible and under my control to pushing of this work on the plans which have been adopted and to stand behind the men who are doing faithful hard work to bring about the early completion of this the greatest constructive enterprise of modern times,1909-Taft
the governments of our dependencies in porto rico and the philippines are progressing as favorably as could be desired,1909-Taft
the prosperity of porto rico continues unabated,1909-Taft
the business conditions in the philippines are not all that we could wish them to be but with the passage of the new tariff bill permitting free trade between the united states and the archipelago with such limitations on sugar and tobacco as shall prevent injury to domestic interests in those products we can count on an improvement in business conditions in the philippines and the development of a mutually profitable trade between this country and the islands,1909-Taft
meantime our government in each dependency is upholding the traditions of civil liberty and increasing popular control which might be expected under american auspices,1909-Taft
the work which we are doing there redounds to our credit as a nation,1909-Taft
i look forward with hope to increasing the already good feeling between the south and the other sections of the country,1909-Taft
my chief purpose is not to effect a change in the electoral vote of the southern states,1909-Taft
that is a secondary consideration,1909-Taft
what i look forward to is an increase in the tolerance of political views of all kinds and their advocacy throughout the south and the existence of a respectable political opposition in every state even more than this to an increased feeling on the part of all the people in the south that this government is their government and that its officers in their states are their officers,1909-Taft
the consideration of this question can not however be complete and full without reference to the negro race its progress and its present condition,1909-Taft
the thirteenth amendment secured them freedom the fourteenth amendment due process of law protection of property and the pursuit of happiness and the fifteenth amendment attempted to secure the negro against any deprivation of the privilege to vote because he was a negro,1909-Taft
the thirteenth and fourteenth amendments have been generally enforced and have secured the objects for which they are intended,1909-Taft
while the fifteenth amendment has not been generally observed in the past it ought to be observed and the tendency of southern legislation today is toward the enactment of electoral qualifications which shall square with that amendment,1909-Taft
of course the mere adoption of a constitutional law is only one step in the right direction,1909-Taft
it must be fairly and justly enforced as well,1909-Taft
in time both will come,1909-Taft
hence it is clear to all that the domination of an ignorant irresponsible element can be prevented by constitutional laws which shall exclude from voting both negroes and whites not having education or other qualifications thought to be necessary for a proper electorate,1909-Taft
the danger of the control of an ignorant electorate has therefore passed,1909-Taft
with this change the interest which many of the southern white citizens take in the welfare of the negroes has increased,1909-Taft
the colored men must base their hope on the results of their own industry self restraint thrift and business success as well as upon the aid and comfort and sympathy which they may receive from their white neighbors of the south,1909-Taft
there was a time when northerners who sympathized with the negro in his necessary struggle for better conditions sought to give him the suffrage as a protection to enforce its exercise against the prevailing sentiment of the south,1909-Taft
the movement proved to be a failure,1909-Taft
what remains is the fifteenth amendment to the constitution and the right to have statutes of states specifying qualifications for electors subjected to the test of compliance with that amendment,1909-Taft
this is a great protection to the negro,1909-Taft
it never will be repealed and it never ought to be repealed,1909-Taft
if it had not passed it might be difficult now to adopt it but with it in our fundamental law the policy of southern legislation must and will tend to obey it and so long as the statutes of the states meet the test of this amendment and are not otherwise in conflict with the constitution and laws of the united states it is not the disposition or within the province of the federal government to interfere with the regulation by southern states of their domestic affairs,1909-Taft
there is in the south a stronger feeling than ever among the intelligent well to do and influential element in favor of the industrial education of the negro and the encouragement of the race to make themselves useful members of the community,1909-Taft
the progress which the negro has made in the last fifty years from slavery when its statistics are reviewed is marvelous and it furnishes every reason to hope that in the next twenty five years a still greater improvement in his condition as a productive member of society on the farm and in the shop and in other occupations may come,1909-Taft
the negroes are now americans,1909-Taft
their ancestors came here years ago against their will and this is their only country and their only flag,1909-Taft
they have shown themselves anxious to live for it and to die for it,1909-Taft
encountering the race feeling against them subjected at times to cruel injustice growing out of it they may well have our profound sympathy and aid in the struggle they are making,1909-Taft
we are charged with the sacred duty of making their path as smooth and easy as we can,1909-Taft
any recognition of their distinguished men any appointment to office from among their number is properly taken as an encouragement and an appreciation of their progress and this just policy should be pursued when suitable occasion offers,1909-Taft
but it may well admit of doubt whether in the case of any race an appointment of one of their number to a local office in a community in which the race feeling is so widespread and acute as to interfere with the ease and facility with which the local government business can be done by the appointee is of sufficient benefit by way of encouragement to the race to outweigh the recurrence and increase of race feeling which such an appointment is likely to engender,1909-Taft
therefore the executive in recognizing the negro race by appointments must exercise a careful discretion not thereby to do it more harm than good,1909-Taft
on the other hand we must be careful not to encourage the mere pretense of race feeling manufactured in the interest of individual political ambition,1909-Taft
personally i have not the slightest race prejudice or feeling and recognition of its existence only awakens in my heart a deeper sympathy for those who have to bear it or suffer from it and i question the wisdom of a policy which is likely to increase it,1909-Taft
meantime if nothing is done to prevent it a better feeling between the negroes and the whites in the south will continue to grow and more and more of the white people will come to realize that the future of the south is to be much benefited by the industrial and intellectual progress of the negro,1909-Taft
the exercise of political franchises by those of this race who are intelligent and well to do will be acquiesced in and the right to vote will be withheld only from the ignorant and irresponsible of both races,1909-Taft
there is one other matter to which i shall refer,1909-Taft
it was made the subject of great controversy during the election and calls for at least a passing reference now,1909-Taft
my distinguished predecessor has given much attention to the cause of labor with whose struggle for better things he has shown the sincerest sympathy,1909-Taft
at his instance congress has passed the bill fixing the liability of interstate carriers to their employees for injury sustained in the course of employment abolishing the rule of fellow servant and the common law rule as to contributory negligence and substituting therefor the so called rule of comparative negligence,1909-Taft
it has also passed a law fixing the compensation of government employees for injuries sustained in the employ of the government through the negligence of the superior,1909-Taft
it has also passed a model child labor law for the district of columbia,1909-Taft
in previous administrations an arbitration law for interstate commerce railroads and their employees and laws for the application of safety devices to save the lives and limbs of employees of interstate railroads had been passed,1909-Taft
additional legislation of this kind was passed by the outgoing congress,1909-Taft
i wish to say that insofar as i can i hope to promote the enactment of further legislation of this character,1909-Taft
i am strongly convinced that the government should make itself as responsible to employees injured in its employ as an interstate railway corporation is made responsible by federal law to its employees and i shall be glad whenever any additional reasonable safety device can be invented to reduce the loss of life and limb among railway employees to urge congress to require its adoption by interstate railways,1909-Taft
another labor question has arisen which has awakened the most excited discussion,1909-Taft
that is in respect to the power of the federal courts to issue injunctions in industrial disputes,1909-Taft
as to that my convictions are fixed,1909-Taft
take away from the courts if it could be taken away the power to issue injunctions in labor disputes and it would create a privileged class among the laborers and save the lawless among their number from a most needful remedy available to all men for the protection of their business against lawless invasion,1909-Taft
the proposition that business is not a property or pecuniary right which can be protected by equitable injunction is utterly without foundation in precedent or reason,1909-Taft
the proposition is usually linked with one to make the secondary boycott lawful,1909-Taft
such a proposition is at variance with the american instinct and will find no support in my judgment when submitted to the american people,1909-Taft
the secondary boycott is an instrument of tyranny and ought not to be made legitimate,1909-Taft
the issue of a temporary restraining order without notice has in several instances been abused by its inconsiderate exercise and to remedy this the platform upon which i was elected recommends the formulation in a statute of the conditions under which such a temporary restraining order ought to issue,1909-Taft
a statute can and ought to be framed to embody the best modern practice and can bring the subject so closely to the attention of the court as to make abuses of the process unlikely in the future,1909-Taft
the american people if i understand them insist that the authority of the courts shall be sustained and are opposed to any change in the procedure by which the powers of a court may be weakened and the fearless and effective administration of justice be interfered with,1909-Taft
having thus reviewed the questions likely to recur during my administration and having expressed in a summary way the position which i expect to take in recommendations to congress and in my conduct as an executive i invoke the considerate sympathy and support of my fellow citizens and the aid of the almighty god in the discharge of my responsible duties,1909-Taft
there has been a change of government,1913-Wilson
it began two years ago when the house of representatives became democratic by a decisive majority,1913-Wilson
it has now been completed,1913-Wilson
the senate about to assemble will also be democratic,1913-Wilson
the offices of president and vice president have been put into the hands of democrats,1913-Wilson
what does the change mean,1913-Wilson
that is the question that is uppermost in our minds today,1913-Wilson
that is the question i am going to try to answer in order if i may to interpret the occasion,1913-Wilson
it means much more than the mere success of a party,1913-Wilson
the success of a party means little except when the nation is using that party for a large and definite purpose,1913-Wilson
no one can mistake the purpose for which the nation now seeks to use the democratic party,1913-Wilson
it seeks to use it to interpret a change in its own plans and point of view,1913-Wilson
some old things with which we had grown familiar and which had begun to creep into the very habit of our thought and of our lives have altered their aspect as we have latterly looked critically upon them with fresh awakened eyes have dropped their disguises and shown themselves alien and sinister,1913-Wilson
some new things as we look frankly upon them willing to comprehend their real character have come to assume the aspect of things long believed in and familiar stuff of our own convictions,1913-Wilson
we have been refreshed by a new insight into our own life,1913-Wilson
we see that in many things that life is very great,1913-Wilson
it is incomparably great in its material aspects in its body of wealth in the diversity and sweep of its energy in the industries which have been conceived and built up by the genius of individual men and the limitless enterprise of groups of men,1913-Wilson
it is great also very great in its moral force,1913-Wilson
nowhere else in the world have noble men and women exhibited in more striking forms the beauty and the energy of sympathy and helpfulness and counsel in their efforts to rectify wrong alleviate suffering and set the weak in the way of strength and hope,1913-Wilson
we have built up moreover a great system of government which has stood through a long age as in many respects a model for those who seek to set liberty upon foundations that will endure against fortuitous change against storm and accident,1913-Wilson
our life contains every great thing and contains it in rich abundance,1913-Wilson
but the evil has come with the good and much fine gold has been corroded,1913-Wilson
with riches has come inexcusable waste,1913-Wilson
we have squandered a great part of what we might have used and have not stopped to conserve the exceeding bounty of nature without which our genius for enterprise would have been worthless and impotent scorning to be careful shamefully prodigal as well as admirably efficient,1913-Wilson
we have been proud of our industrial achievements but we have not hitherto stopped thoughtfully enough to count the human cost the cost of lives snuffed out of energies overtaxed and broken the fearful physical and spiritual cost to the men and women and children upon whom the dead weight and burden of it all has fallen pitilessly the years through,1913-Wilson
the groans and agony of it all had not yet reached our ears the solemn moving undertone of our life coming up out of the mines and factories and out of every home where the struggle had its intimate and familiar seat,1913-Wilson
with the great government went many deep secret things which we too long delayed to look into and scrutinize with candid fearless eyes,1913-Wilson
the great government we loved has too often been made use of for private and selfish purposes and those who used it had forgotten the people,1913-Wilson
at last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole,1913-Wilson
we see the bad with the good the debased and decadent with the sound and vital,1913-Wilson
with this vision we approach new affairs,1913-Wilson
our duty is to cleanse to reconsider to restore to correct the evil without impairing the good to purify and humanize every process of our common life without weakening or sentimentalizing it,1913-Wilson
there has been something crude and heartless and unfeeling in our haste to succeed and be great,1913-Wilson
our thought has been let every man look out for himself let every generation look out for itself while we reared giant machinery which made it impossible that any but those who stood at the levers of control should have a chance to look out for themselves,1913-Wilson
we had not forgotten our morals,1913-Wilson
we remembered well enough that we had set up a policy which was meant to serve the humblest as well as the most powerful with an eye single to the standards of justice and fair play and remembered it with pride,1913-Wilson
but we were very heedless and in a hurry to be great,1913-Wilson
we have come now to the sober second thought,1913-Wilson
the scales of heedlessness have fallen from our eyes,1913-Wilson
we have made up our minds to square every process of our national life again with the standards we so proudly set up at the beginning and have always carried at our hearts,1913-Wilson
our work is a work of restoration,1913-Wilson
we have itemized with some degree of particularity the things that ought to be altered and here are some of the chief items a tariff which cuts us off from our proper part in the commerce of the world violates the just principles of taxation and makes the government a facile instrument in the hand of private interests a banking and currency system based upon the necessity of the government to sell its bonds fifty years ago and perfectly adapted to concentrating cash and restricting credits an industrial system which take it on all its sides financial as well as administrative holds capital in leading strings restricts the liberties and limits the opportunities of labor and exploits without renewing or conserving the natural resources of the country a body of agricultural activities never yet given the efficiency of great business undertakings or served as it should be through the instrumentality of science taken directly to the farm or afforded the facilities of credit best suited to its practical needs watercourses undeveloped waste places unreclaimed forests untended fast disappearing without plan or prospect of renewal unregarded waste heaps at every mine,1913-Wilson
we have studied as perhaps no other nation has the most effective means of production but we have not studied cost or economy as we should either as organizers of industry as statesmen or as individuals,1913-Wilson
nor have we studied and perfected the means by which government may be put at the service of humanity in safeguarding the health of the nation the health of its men and its women and its children as well as their rights in the struggle for existence,1913-Wilson
this is no sentimental duty,1913-Wilson
the firm basis of government is justice not pity,1913-Wilson
these are matters of justice,1913-Wilson
there can be no equality or opportunity the first essential of justice in the body politic if men and women and children be not shielded in their lives their very vitality from the consequences of great industrial and social processes which they can not alter control or singly cope with,1913-Wilson
society must see to it that it does not itself crush or weaken or damage its own constituent parts,1913-Wilson
the first duty of law is to keep sound the society it serves,1913-Wilson
sanitary laws pure food laws and laws determining conditions of labor which individuals are powerless to determine for themselves are intimate parts of the very business of justice and legal efficiency,1913-Wilson
these are some of the things we ought to do and not leave the others undone the old fashioned never to be neglected fundamental safeguarding of property and of individual right,1913-Wilson
this is the high enterprise of the new day to lift everything that concerns our life as a nation to the light that shines from the hearthfire of every man s conscience and vision of the right,1913-Wilson
it is inconceivable that we should do this as partisans it is inconceivable we should do it in ignorance of the facts as they are or in blind haste,1913-Wilson
we shall restore not destroy,1913-Wilson
we shall deal with our economic system as it is and as it may be modified not as it might be if we had a clean sheet of paper to write upon and step by step we shall make it what it should be in the spirit of those who question their own wisdom and seek counsel and knowledge not shallow self satisfaction or the excitement of excursions whither they can not tell,1913-Wilson
justice and only justice shall always be our motto,1913-Wilson
and yet it will be no cool process of mere science,1913-Wilson
the nation has been deeply stirred stirred by a solemn passion stirred by the knowledge of wrong of ideals lost of government too often debauched and made an instrument of evil,1913-Wilson
the feelings with which we face this new age of right and opportunity sweep across our heartstrings like some air out of god s own presence where justice and mercy are reconciled and the judge and the brother are one,1913-Wilson
we know our task to be no mere task of politics but a task which shall search us through and through whether we be able to understand our time and the need of our people whether we be indeed their spokesmen and interpreters whether we have the pure heart to comprehend and the rectified will to choose our high course of action,1913-Wilson
this is not a day of triumph it is a day of dedication,1913-Wilson
here muster not the forces of party but the forces of humanity,1913-Wilson
men s hearts wait upon us men s lives hang in the balance men s hopes call upon us to say what we will do,1913-Wilson
who shall live up to the great trust,1913-Wilson
who dares fail to try,1913-Wilson
i summon all honest men all patriotic all forward looking men to my side,1913-Wilson
god helping me i will not fail them if they will but counsel and sustain me,1913-Wilson
my fellow citizens the four years which have elapsed since last i stood in this place have been crowded with counsel and action of the most vital interest and consequence,1917-Wilson
perhaps no equal period in our history has been so fruitful of important reforms in our economic and industrial life or so full of significant changes in the spirit and purpose of our political action,1917-Wilson
we have sought very thoughtfully to set our house in order correct the grosser errors and abuses of our industrial life liberate and quicken the processes of our national genius and energy and lift our politics to a broader view of the people s essential interests,1917-Wilson
it is a record of singular variety and singular distinction,1917-Wilson
but i shall not attempt to review it,1917-Wilson
it speaks for itself and will be of increasing influence as the years go by,1917-Wilson
this is not the time for retrospect,1917-Wilson
it is time rather to speak our thoughts and purposes concerning the present and the immediate future,1917-Wilson
although we have centered counsel and action with such unusual concentration and success upon the great problems of domestic legislation to which we addressed ourselves four years ago other matters have more and more forced themselves upon our attention matters lying outside our own life as a nation and over which we had no control but which despite our wish to keep free of them have drawn us more and more irresistibly into their own current and influence,1917-Wilson
it has been impossible to avoid them,1917-Wilson
they have affected the life of the whole world,1917-Wilson
they have shaken men everywhere with a passion and an apprehension they never knew before,1917-Wilson
it has been hard to preserve calm counsel while the thought of our own people swayed this way and that under their influence,1917-Wilson
we are a composite and cosmopolitan people,1917-Wilson
we are of the blood of all the nations that are at war,1917-Wilson
the currents of our thoughts as well as the currents of our trade run quick at all seasons back and forth between us and them,1917-Wilson
the war inevitably set its mark from the first alike upon our minds our industries our commerce our politics and our social action,1917-Wilson
to be indifferent to it or independent of it was out of the question,1917-Wilson
and yet all the while we have been conscious that we were not part of it,1917-Wilson
in that consciousness despite many divisions we have drawn closer together,1917-Wilson
we have been deeply wronged upon the seas but we have not wished to wrong or injure in return have retained throughout the consciousness of standing in some sort apart intent upon an interest that transcended the immediate issues of the war itself,1917-Wilson
as some of the injuries done us have become intolerable we have still been clear that we wished nothing for ourselves that we were not ready to demand for all mankind fair dealing justice the freedom to live and to be at ease against organized wrong,1917-Wilson
it is in this spirit and with this thought that we have grown more and more aware more and more certain that the part we wished to play was the part of those who mean to vindicate and fortify peace,1917-Wilson
we have been obliged to arm ourselves to make good our claim to a certain minimum of right and of freedom of action,1917-Wilson
we stand firm in armed neutrality since it seems that in no other way we can demonstrate what it is we insist upon and cannot forget,1917-Wilson
we may even be drawn on by circumstances not by our own purpose or desire to a more active assertion of our rights as we see them and a more immediate association with the great struggle itself,1917-Wilson
but nothing will alter our thought or our purpose,1917-Wilson
they are too clear to be obscured,1917-Wilson
they are too deeply rooted in the principles of our national life to be altered,1917-Wilson
we desire neither conquest nor advantage,1917-Wilson
we wish nothing that can be had only at the cost of another people,1917-Wilson
we always professed unselfish purpose and we covet the opportunity to prove our professions are sincere,1917-Wilson
there are many things still to be done at home to clarify our own politics and add new vitality to the industrial processes of our own life and we shall do them as time and opportunity serve but we realize that the greatest things that remain to be done must be done with the whole world for stage and in cooperation with the wide and universal forces of mankind and we are making our spirits ready for those things,1917-Wilson
we are provincials no longer,1917-Wilson
the tragic events of the thirty months of vital turmoil through which we have just passed have made us citizens of the world,1917-Wilson
there can be no turning back,1917-Wilson
our own fortunes as a nation are involved whether we would have it so or not,1917-Wilson
and yet we are not the less americans on that account,1917-Wilson
we shall be the more american if we but remain true to the principles in which we have been bred,1917-Wilson
they are not the principles of a province or of a single continent,1917-Wilson
we have known and boasted all along that they were the principles of a liberated mankind,1917-Wilson
these therefore are the things we shall stand for whether in war or in peace,1917-Wilson
that all nations are equally interested in the peace of the world and in the political stability of free peoples and equally responsible for their maintenance that the essential principle of peace is the actual equality of nations in all matters of right or privilege that peace cannot securely or justly rest upon an armed balance of power that governments derive all their just powers from the consent of the governed and that no other powers should be supported by the common thought purpose or power of the family of nations that the seas should be equally free and safe for the use of all peoples under rules set up by common agreement and consent and that so far as practicable they should be accessible to all upon equal terms that national armaments shall be limited to the necessities of national order and domestic safety that the community of interest and of power upon which peace must henceforth depend imposes upon each nation the duty of seeing to it that all influences proceeding from its own citizens meant to encourage or assist revolution in other states should be sternly and effectually suppressed and prevented,1917-Wilson
i need not argue these principles to you my fellow countrymen they are your own part and parcel of your own thinking and your own motives in affairs,1917-Wilson
they spring up native amongst us,1917-Wilson
upon this as a platform of purpose and of action we can stand together,1917-Wilson
and it is imperative that we should stand together,1917-Wilson
we are being forged into a new unity amidst the fires that now blaze throughout the world,1917-Wilson
in their ardent heat we shall in god s providence let us hope be purged of faction and division purified of the errant humors of party and of private interest and shall stand forth in the days to come with a new dignity of national pride and spirit,1917-Wilson
let each man see to it that the dedication is in his own heart the high purpose of the nation in his own mind ruler of his own will and desire,1917-Wilson
i stand here and have taken the high and solemn oath to which you have been audience because the people of the united states have chosen me for this august delegation of power and have by their gracious judgment named me their leader in affairs,1917-Wilson
i know now what the task means,1917-Wilson
i realize to the full the responsibility which it involves,1917-Wilson
i pray god i may be given the wisdom and the prudence to do my duty in the true spirit of this great people,1917-Wilson
i am their servant and can succeed only as they sustain and guide me by their confidence and their counsel,1917-Wilson
the thing i shall count upon the thing without which neither counsel nor action will avail is the unity of america an america united in feeling in purpose and in its vision of duty of opportunity and of service,1917-Wilson
we are to beware of all men who would turn the tasks and the necessities of the nation to their own private profit or use them for the building up of private power,1917-Wilson
united alike in the conception of our duty and in the high resolve to perform it in the face of all men let us dedicate ourselves to the great task to which we must now set our hand,1917-Wilson
for myself i beg your tolerance your countenance and your united aid,1917-Wilson
the shadows that now lie dark upon our path will soon be dispelled and we shall walk with the light all about us if we be but true to ourselves to ourselves as we have wished to be known in the counsels of the world and in the thought of all those who love liberty and justice and the right exalted,1917-Wilson
my countrymen,1921-Harding
when one surveys the world about him after the great storm noting the marks of destruction and yet rejoicing in the ruggedness of the things which withstood it if he is an american he breathes the clarified atmosphere with a strange mingling of regret and new hope,1921-Harding
we have seen a world passion spend its fury but we contemplate our republic unshaken and hold our civilization secure,1921-Harding
liberty liberty within the law and civilization are inseparable and though both were threatened we find them now secure and there comes to americans the profound assurance that our representative government is the highest expression and surest guaranty of both,1921-Harding
standing in this presence mindful of the solemnity of this occasion feeling the emotions which no one may know until he senses the great weight of responsibility for himself i must utter my belief in the divine inspiration of the founding fathers,1921-Harding
surely there must have been god s intent in the making of this new world republic,1921-Harding
ours is an organic law which had but one ambiguity and we saw that effaced in a baptism of sacrifice and blood with union maintained the nation supreme and its concord inspiring,1921-Harding
we have seen the world rivet its hopeful gaze on the great truths on which the founders wrought,1921-Harding
we have seen civil human and religious liberty verified and glorified,1921-Harding
in the beginning the old world scoffed at our experiment today our foundations of political and social belief stand unshaken a precious inheritance to ourselves an inspiring example of freedom and civilization to all mankind,1921-Harding
let us express renewed and strengthened devotion in grateful reverence for the immortal beginning and utter our confidence in the supreme fulfillment,1921-Harding
the recorded progress of our republic materially and spiritually in itself proves the wisdom of the inherited policy of noninvolvement in old world affairs,1921-Harding
confident of our ability to work out our own destiny and jealously guarding our right to do so we seek no part in directing the destinies of the old world,1921-Harding
we do not mean to be entangled,1921-Harding
we will accept no responsibility except as our own conscience and judgment in each instance may determine,1921-Harding
our eyes never will be blind to a developing menace our ears never deaf to the call of civilization,1921-Harding
we recognize the new order in the world with the closer contacts which progress has wrought,1921-Harding
we sense the call of the human heart for fellowship fraternity and cooperation,1921-Harding
we crave friendship and harbor no hate,1921-Harding
but america our america the america builded on the foundation laid by the inspired fathers can be a party to no permanent military alliance,1921-Harding
it can enter into no political commitments nor assume any economic obligations which will subject our decisions to any other than our own authority,1921-Harding
i am sure our own people will not misunderstand nor will the world misconstrue,1921-Harding
we have no thought to impede the paths to closer relationship,1921-Harding
we wish to promote understanding,1921-Harding
we want to do our part in making offensive warfare so hateful that governments and peoples who resort to it must prove the righteousness of their cause or stand as outlaws before the bar of civilization,1921-Harding
we are ready to associate ourselves with the nations of the world great and small for conference for counsel to seek the expressed views of world opinion to recommend a way to approximate disarmament and relieve the crushing burdens of military and naval establishments,1921-Harding
we elect to participate in suggesting plans for mediation conciliation and arbitration and would gladly join in that expressed conscience of progress which seeks to clarify and write the laws of international relationship and establish a world court for the disposition of such justiciable questions as nations are agreed to submit thereto,1921-Harding
in expressing aspirations in seeking practical plans in translating humanity s new concept of righteousness and justice and its hatred of war into recommended action we are ready most heartily to unite but every commitment must be made in the exercise of our national sovereignty,1921-Harding
since freedom impelled and independence inspired and nationality exalted a world supergovernment is contrary to everything we cherish and can have no sanction by our republic,1921-Harding
this is not selfishness it is sanctity,1921-Harding
it is not aloofness it is security,1921-Harding
it is not suspicion of others it is patriotic adherence to the things which made us what we are,1921-Harding
today better than ever before we know the aspirations of humankind and share them,1921-Harding
we have come to a new realization of our place in the world and a new appraisal of our nation by the world,1921-Harding
the unselfishness of these united states is a thing proven our devotion to peace for ourselves and for the world is well established our concern for preserved civilization has had its impassioned and heroic expression,1921-Harding
there was no american failure to resist the attempted reversion of civilization there will be no failure today or tomorrow,1921-Harding
the success of our popular government rests wholly upon the correct interpretation of the deliberate intelligent dependable popular will of america,1921-Harding
in a deliberate questioning of a suggested change of national policy where internationality was to supersede nationality we turned to a referendum to the american people,1921-Harding
there was ample discussion and there is a public mandate in manifest understanding,1921-Harding
america is ready to encourage eager to initiate anxious to participate in any seemly program likely to lessen the probability of war and promote that brotherhood of mankind which must be god s highest conception of human relationship,1921-Harding
because we cherish ideals of justice and peace because we appraise international comity and helpful relationship no less highly than any people of the world we aspire to a high place in the moral leadership of civilization and we hold a maintained america the proven republic the unshaken temple of representative democracy to be not only an inspiration and example but the highest agency of strengthening good will and promoting accord on both continents,1921-Harding
mankind needs a world wide benediction of understanding,1921-Harding
it is needed among individuals among peoples among governments and it will inaugurate an era of good feeling to make the birth of a new order,1921-Harding
in such understanding men will strive confidently for the promotion of their better relationships and nations will promote the comities so essential to peace,1921-Harding
we must understand that ties of trade bind nations in closest intimacy and none may receive except as he gives,1921-Harding
we have not strengthened ours in accordance with our resources or our genius notably on our own continent where a galaxy of republics reflects the glory of new world democracy but in the new order of finance and trade we mean to promote enlarged activities and seek expanded confidence,1921-Harding
perhaps we can make no more helpful contribution by example than prove a republic s capacity to emerge from the wreckage of war,1921-Harding
while the world s embittered travail did not leave us devastated lands nor desolated cities left no gaping wounds no breast with hate it did involve us in the delirium of expenditure in expanded currency and credits in unbalanced industry in unspeakable waste and disturbed relationships,1921-Harding
while it uncovered our portion of hateful selfishness at home it also revealed the heart of america as sound and fearless and beating in confidence unfailing,1921-Harding
amid it all we have riveted the gaze of all civilization to the unselfishness and the righteousness of representative democracy where our freedom never has made offensive warfare never has sought territorial aggrandizement through force never has turned to the arbitrament of arms until reason has been exhausted,1921-Harding
when the governments of the earth shall have established a freedom like our own and shall have sanctioned the pursuit of peace as we have practiced it i believe the last sorrow and the final sacrifice of international warfare will have been written,1921-Harding
let me speak to the maimed and wounded soldiers who are present today and through them convey to their comrades the gratitude of the republic for their sacrifices in its defense,1921-Harding
a generous country will never forget the services you rendered and you may hope for a policy under government that will relieve any maimed successors from taking your places on another such occasion as this,1921-Harding
our supreme task is the resumption of our onward normal way,1921-Harding
reconstruction readjustment restoration all these must follow,1921-Harding
i would like to hasten them,1921-Harding
if it will lighten the spirit and add to the resolution with which we take up the task let me repeat for our nation we shall give no people just cause to make war upon us we hold no national prejudices we entertain no spirit of revenge we do not hate we do not covet we dream of no conquest nor boast of armed prowess,1921-Harding
if despite this attitude war is again forced upon us i earnestly hope a way may be found which will unify our individual and collective strength and consecrate all america materially and spiritually body and soul to national defense,1921-Harding
i can vision the ideal republic where every man and woman is called under the flag for assignment to duty for whatever service military or civic the individual is best fitted where we may call to universal service every plant agency or facility all in the sublime sacrifice for country and not one penny of war profit shall inure to the benefit of private individual corporation or combination but all above the normal shall flow into the defense chest of the nation,1921-Harding
there is something inherently wrong something out of accord with the ideals of representative democracy when one portion of our citizenship turns its activities to private gain amid defensive war while another is fighting sacrificing or dying for national preservation,1921-Harding
out of such universal service will come a new unity of spirit and purpose a new confidence and consecration which would make our defense impregnable our triumph assured,1921-Harding
then we should have little or no disorganization of our economic industrial and commercial systems at home no staggering war debts no swollen fortunes to flout the sacrifices of our soldiers no excuse for sedition no pitiable slackerism no outrage of treason,1921-Harding
envy and jealousy would have no soil for their menacing development and revolution would be without the passion which engenders it,1921-Harding
a regret for the mistakes of yesterday must not however blind us to the tasks of today,1921-Harding
war never left such an aftermath,1921-Harding
there has been staggering loss of life and measureless wastage of materials,1921-Harding
nations are still groping for return to stable ways,1921-Harding
discouraging indebtedness confronts us like all the war torn nations and these obligations must be provided for,1921-Harding
no civilization can survive repudiation,1921-Harding
we can reduce the abnormal expenditures and we will,1921-Harding
we can strike at war taxation and we must,1921-Harding
we must face the grim necessity with full knowledge that the task is to be solved and we must proceed with a full realization that no statute enacted by man can repeal the inexorable laws of nature,1921-Harding
our most dangerous tendency is to expect too much of government and at the same time do for it too little,1921-Harding
we contemplate the immediate task of putting our public household in order,1921-Harding
we need a rigid and yet sane economy combined with fiscal justice and it must be attended by individual prudence and thrift which are so essential to this trying hour and reassuring for the future,1921-Harding
the business world reflects the disturbance of war s reaction,1921-Harding
herein flows the lifeblood of material existence,1921-Harding
the economic mechanism is intricate and its parts interdependent and has suffered the shocks and jars incident to abnormal demands credit inflations and price upheavals,1921-Harding
the normal balances have been impaired the channels of distribution have been clogged the relations of labor and management have been strained,1921-Harding
we must seek the readjustment with care and courage,1921-Harding
our people must give and take,1921-Harding
prices must reflect the receding fever of war activities,1921-Harding
perhaps we never shall know the old levels of wages again because war invariably readjusts compensations and the necessaries of life will show their inseparable relationship but we must strive for normalcy to reach stability,1921-Harding
all the penalties will not be light nor evenly distributed,1921-Harding
there is no way of making them so,1921-Harding
there is no instant step from disorder to order,1921-Harding
we must face a condition of grim reality charge off our losses and start afresh,1921-Harding
it is the oldest lesson of civilization,1921-Harding
i would like government to do all it can to mitigate then in understanding in mutuality of interest in concern for the common good our tasks will be solved,1921-Harding
no altered system will work a miracle,1921-Harding
any wild experiment will only add to the confusion,1921-Harding
our best assurance lies in efficient administration of our proven system,1921-Harding
the forward course of the business cycle is unmistakable,1921-Harding
peoples are turning from destruction to production,1921-Harding
industry has sensed the changed order and our own people are turning to resume their normal onward way,1921-Harding
the call is for productive america to go on,1921-Harding
i know that congress and the administration will favor every wise government policy to aid the resumption and encourage continued progress,1921-Harding
i speak for administrative efficiency for lightened tax burdens for sound commercial practices for adequate credit facilities for sympathetic concern for all agricultural problems for the omission of unnecessary interference of government with business for an end to government s experiment in business and for more efficient business in government administration,1921-Harding
with all of this must attend a mindfulness of the human side of all activities so that social industrial and economic justice will be squared with the purposes of a righteous people,1921-Harding
with the nation wide induction of womanhood into our political life we may count upon her intuitions her refinements her intelligence and her influence to exalt the social order,1921-Harding
we count upon her exercise of the full privileges and the performance of the duties of citizenship to speed the attainment of the highest state,1921-Harding
i wish for an america no less alert in guarding against dangers from within than it is watchful against enemies from without,1921-Harding
our fundamental law recognizes no class no group no section there must be none in legislation or administration,1921-Harding
the supreme inspiration is the common weal,1921-Harding
humanity hungers for international peace and we crave it with all mankind,1921-Harding
my most reverent prayer for america is for industrial peace with its rewards widely and generally distributed amid the inspirations of equal opportunity,1921-Harding
no one justly may deny the equality of opportunity which made us what we are,1921-Harding
we have mistaken unpreparedness to embrace it to be a challenge of the reality and due concern for making all citizens fit for participation will give added strength of citizenship and magnify our achievement,1921-Harding
if revolution insists upon overturning established order let other peoples make the tragic experiment,1921-Harding
there is no place for it in america,1921-Harding
when world war threatened civilization we pledged our resources and our lives to its preservation and when revolution threatens we unfurl the flag of law and order and renew our consecration,1921-Harding
ours is a constitutional freedom where the popular will is the law supreme and minorities are sacredly protected,1921-Harding
our revisions reformations and evolutions reflect a deliberate judgment and an orderly progress and we mean to cure our ills but never destroy or permit destruction by force,1921-Harding
i had rather submit our industrial controversies to the conference table in advance than to a settlement table after conflict and suffering,1921-Harding
the earth is thirsting for the cup of good will understanding is its fountain source,1921-Harding
i would like to acclaim an era of good feeling amid dependable prosperity and all the blessings which attend,1921-Harding
it has been proved again and again that we cannot while throwing our markets open to the world maintain american standards of living and opportunity and hold our industrial eminence in such unequal competition,1921-Harding
there is a luring fallacy in the theory of banished barriers of trade but preserved american standards require our higher production costs to be reflected in our tariffs on imports,1921-Harding
today as never before when peoples are seeking trade restoration and expansion we must adjust our tariffs to the new order,1921-Harding
we seek participation in the world s exchanges because therein lies our way to widened influence and the triumphs of peace,1921-Harding
we know full well we cannot sell where we do not buy and we cannot sell successfully where we do not carry,1921-Harding
opportunity is calling not alone for the restoration but for a new era in production transportation and trade,1921-Harding
we shall answer it best by meeting the demand of a surpassing home market by promoting self reliance in production and by bidding enterprise genius and efficiency to carry our cargoes in american bottoms to the marts of the world,1921-Harding
we would not have an america living within and for herself alone but we would have her self reliant independent and ever nobler stronger and richer,1921-Harding
believing in our higher standards reared through constitutional liberty and maintained opportunity we invite the world to the same heights,1921-Harding
but pride in things wrought is no reflex of a completed task,1921-Harding
common welfare is the goal of our national endeavor,1921-Harding
wealth is not inimical to welfare it ought to be its friendliest agency,1921-Harding
there never can be equality of rewards or possessions so long as the human plan contains varied talents and differing degrees of industry and thrift but ours ought to be a country free from the great blotches of distressed poverty,1921-Harding
we ought to find a way to guard against the perils and penalties of unemployment,1921-Harding
we want an america of homes illumined with hope and happiness where mothers freed from the necessity for long hours of toil beyond their own doors may preside as befits the hearthstone of american citizenship,1921-Harding
we want the cradle of american childhood rocked under conditions so wholesome and so hopeful that no blight may touch it in its development and we want to provide that no selfish interest no material necessity no lack of opportunity shall prevent the gaining of that education so essential to best citizenship,1921-Harding
there is no short cut to the making of these ideals into glad realities,1921-Harding
the world has witnessed again and again the futility and the mischief of ill considered remedies for social and economic disorders,1921-Harding
but we are mindful today as never before of the friction of modern industrialism and we must learn its causes and reduce its evil consequences by sober and tested methods,1921-Harding
where genius has made for great possibilities justice and happiness must be reflected in a greater common welfare,1921-Harding
service is the supreme commitment of life,1921-Harding
i would rejoice to acclaim the era of the golden rule and crown it with the autocracy of service,1921-Harding
i pledge an administration wherein all the agencies of government are called to serve and ever promote an understanding of government purely as an expression of the popular will,1921-Harding
one cannot stand in this presence and be unmindful of the tremendous responsibility,1921-Harding
the world upheaval has added heavily to our tasks,1921-Harding
but with the realization comes the surge of high resolve and there is reassurance in belief in the god given destiny of our republic,1921-Harding
if i felt that there is to be sole responsibility in the executive for the america of tomorrow i should shrink from the burden,1921-Harding
but here are a hundred millions with common concern and shared responsibility answerable to god and country,1921-Harding
the republic summons them to their duty and i invite co operation,1921-Harding
i accept my part with single mindedness of purpose and humility of spirit and implore the favor and guidance of god in his heaven,1921-Harding
with these i am unafraid and confidently face the future,1921-Harding
i have taken the solemn oath of office on that passage of holy writ wherein it is asked what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god,1921-Harding
this i plight to god and country,1921-Harding
my countrymen,1925-Coolidge
no one can contemplate current conditions without finding much that is satisfying and still more that is encouraging,1925-Coolidge
our own country is leading the world in the general readjustment to the results of the great conflict,1925-Coolidge
many of its burdens will bear heavily upon us for years and the secondary and indirect effects we must expect to experience for some time,1925-Coolidge
but we are beginning to comprehend more definitely what course should be pursued what remedies ought to be applied what actions should be taken for our deliverance and are clearly manifesting a determined will faithfully and conscientiously to adopt these methods of relief,1925-Coolidge
already we have sufficiently rearranged our domestic affairs so that confidence has returned business has revived and we appear to be entering an era of prosperity which is gradually reaching into every part of the nation,1925-Coolidge
realizing that we can not live unto ourselves alone we have contributed of our resources and our counsel to the relief of the suffering and the settlement of the disputes among the european nations,1925-Coolidge
because of what america is and what america has done a firmer courage a higher hope inspires the heart of all humanity,1925-Coolidge
these results have not occurred by mere chance,1925-Coolidge
they have been secured by a constant and enlightened effort marked by many sacrifices and extending over many generations,1925-Coolidge
we can not continue these brilliant successes in the future unless we continue to learn from the past,1925-Coolidge
it is necessary to keep the former experiences of our country both at home and abroad continually before us if we are to have any science of government,1925-Coolidge
if we wish to erect new structures we must have a definite knowledge of the old foundations,1925-Coolidge
we must realize that human nature is about the most constant thing in the universe and that the essentials of human relationship do not change,1925-Coolidge
we must frequently take our bearings from these fixed stars of our political firmament if we expect to hold a true course,1925-Coolidge
if we examine carefully what we have done we can determine the more accurately what we can do,1925-Coolidge
we stand at the opening of the one hundred and fiftieth year since our national consciousness first asserted itself by unmistakable action with an array of force,1925-Coolidge
the old sentiment of detached and dependent colonies disappeared in the new sentiment of a united and independent nation,1925-Coolidge
men began to discard the narrow confines of a local charter for the broader opportunities of a national constitution,1925-Coolidge
under the eternal urge of freedom we became an independent nation,1925-Coolidge
a little less than 50 years later that freedom and independence were reasserted in the face of all the world and guarded supported and secured by the monroe doctrine,1925-Coolidge
the narrow fringe of states along the atlantic seaboard advanced its frontiers across the hills and plains of an intervening continent until it passed down the golden slope to the pacific,1925-Coolidge
we made freedom a birthright,1925-Coolidge
we extended our domain over distant islands in order to safeguard our own interests and accepted the consequent obligation to bestow justice and liberty upon less favored peoples,1925-Coolidge
in the defense of our own ideals and in the general cause of liberty we entered the great war,1925-Coolidge
when victory had been fully secured we withdrew to our own shores unrecompensed save in the consciousness of duty done,1925-Coolidge
throughout all these experiences we have enlarged our freedom we have strengthened our independence,1925-Coolidge
we have been and propose to be more and more american,1925-Coolidge
we believe that we can best serve our own country and most successfully discharge our obligations to humanity by continuing to be openly and candidly in tensely and scrupulously american,1925-Coolidge
if we have any heritage it has been that,1925-Coolidge
if we have any destiny we have found it in that direction,1925-Coolidge
but if we wish to continue to be distinctively american we must continue to make that term comprehensive enough to embrace the legitimate desires of a civilized and enlightened people determined in all their relations to pursue a conscientious and religious life,1925-Coolidge
we can not permit ourselves to be narrowed and dwarfed by slogans and phrases,1925-Coolidge
it is not the adjective but the substantive which is of real importance,1925-Coolidge
it is not the name of the action but the result of the action which is the chief concern,1925-Coolidge
it will be well not to be too much disturbed by the thought of either isolation or entanglement of pacifists and militarists,1925-Coolidge
the physical configuration of the earth has separated us from all of the old world but the common brotherhood of man the highest law of all our being has united us by inseparable bonds with all humanity,1925-Coolidge
our country represents nothing but peaceful intentions toward all the earth but it ought not to fail to maintain such a military force as comports with the dignity and security of a great people,1925-Coolidge
it ought to be a balanced force intensely modem capable of defense by sea and land beneath the surface and in the air,1925-Coolidge
but it should be so conducted that all the world may see in it not a menace but an instrument of security and peace,1925-Coolidge
this nation believes thoroughly in an honorable peace under which the rights of its citizens are to be everywhere protected,1925-Coolidge
it has never found that the necessary enjoyment of such a peace could be maintained only by a great and threatening array of arms,1925-Coolidge
in common with other nations it is now more determined than ever to promote peace through friendliness and good will through mutual understandings and mutual forbearance,1925-Coolidge
we have never practiced the policy of competitive armaments,1925-Coolidge
we have recently committed ourselves by covenants with the other great nations to a limitation of our sea power,1925-Coolidge
as one result of this our navy ranks larger in comparison than it ever did before,1925-Coolidge
removing the burden of expense and jealousy which must always accrue from a keen rivalry is one of the most effective methods of diminishing that unreasonable hysteria and misunderstanding which are the most potent means of fomenting war,1925-Coolidge
this policy represents a new departure in the world,1925-Coolidge
it is a thought an ideal which has led to an entirely new line of action,1925-Coolidge
it will not be easy to maintain,1925-Coolidge
some never moved from their old positions some are constantly slipping back to the old ways of thought and the old action of seizing a musket and relying on force,1925-Coolidge
america has taken the lead in this new direction and that lead america must continue to hold,1925-Coolidge
if we expect others to rely on our fairness and justice we must show that we rely on their fairness and justice,1925-Coolidge
if we are to judge by past experience there is much to be hoped for in international relations from frequent conferences and consultations,1925-Coolidge
we have before us the beneficial results of the washington conference and the various consultations recently held upon european affairs some of which were in response to our suggestions and in some of which we were active participants,1925-Coolidge
even the failures can not but be accounted useful and an immeasurable advance over threatened or actual warfare,1925-Coolidge
i am strongly in favor of continuation of this policy whenever conditions are such that there is even a promise that practical and favorable results might be secured,1925-Coolidge
in conformity with the principle that a display of reason rather than a threat of force should be the determining factor in the intercourse among nations we have long advocated the peaceful settlement of disputes by methods of arbitration and have negotiated many treaties to secure that result,1925-Coolidge
the same considerations should lead to our adherence to the permanent court of international justice,1925-Coolidge
where great principles are involved where great movements are under way which promise much for the welfare of humanity by reason of the very fact that many other nations have given such movements their actual support we ought not to withhold our own sanction because of any small and inessential difference but only upon the ground of the most important and compelling fundamental reasons,1925-Coolidge
we can not barter away our independence or our sovereignty but we ought to engage in no refinements of logic no sophistries and no subterfuges to argue away the undoubted duty of this country by reason of the might of its numbers the power of its resources and its position of leadership in the world actively and comprehensively to signify its approval and to bear its full share of the responsibility of a candid and disinterested attempt at the establishment of a tribunal for the administration of even handed justice between nation and nation,1925-Coolidge
the weight of our enormous influence must be cast upon the side of a reign not of force but of law and trial not by battle but by reason,1925-Coolidge
we have never any wish to interfere in the political conditions of any other countries,1925-Coolidge
especially are we determined not to become implicated in the political controversies of the old world,1925-Coolidge
with a great deal of hesitation we have responded to appeals for help to maintain order protect life and property and establish responsible government in some of the small countries of the western hemisphere,1925-Coolidge
our private citizens have advanced large sums of money to assist in the necessary financing and relief of the old world,1925-Coolidge
we have not failed nor shall we fail to respond whenever necessary to mitigate human suffering and assist in the rehabilitation of distressed nations,1925-Coolidge
these too are requirements which must be met by reason of our vast powers and the place we hold in the world,1925-Coolidge
some of the best thought of mankind has long been seeking for a formula for permanent peace,1925-Coolidge
undoubtedly the clarification of the principles of international law would be helpful and the efforts of scholars to prepare such a work for adoption by the various nations should have our sympathy and support,1925-Coolidge
much may be hoped for from the earnest studies of those who advocate the outlawing of aggressive war,1925-Coolidge
but all these plans and preparations these treaties and covenants will not of themselves be adequate,1925-Coolidge
one of the greatest dangers to peace lies in the economic pressure to which people find themselves subjected,1925-Coolidge
one of the most practical things to be done in the world is to seek arrangements under which such pressure may be removed so that opportunity may be renewed and hope may be revived,1925-Coolidge
there must be some assurance that effort and endeavor will be followed by success and prosperity,1925-Coolidge
in the making and financing of such adjustments there is not only an opportunity but a real duty for america to respond with her counsel and her resources,1925-Coolidge
conditions must be provided under which people can make a living and work out of their difficulties,1925-Coolidge
but there is another element more important than all without which there can not be the slightest hope of a permanent peace,1925-Coolidge
that element lies in the heart of humanity,1925-Coolidge
unless the desire for peace be cherished there unless this fundamental and only natural source of brotherly love be cultivated to its highest degree all artificial efforts will be in vain,1925-Coolidge
peace will come when there is realization that only under a reign of law based on righteousness and supported by the religious conviction of the brotherhood of man can there be any hope of a complete and satisfying life,1925-Coolidge
parchment will fail the sword will fail it is only the spiritual nature of man that can be triumphant,1925-Coolidge
it seems altogether probable that we can contribute most to these important objects by maintaining our position of political detachment and independence,1925-Coolidge
we are not identified with any old world interests,1925-Coolidge
this position should be made more and more clear in our relations with all foreign countries,1925-Coolidge
we are at peace with all of them,1925-Coolidge
our program is never to oppress but always to assist,1925-Coolidge
but while we do justice to others we must require that justice be done to us,1925-Coolidge
with us a treaty of peace means peace and a treaty of amity means amity,1925-Coolidge
we have made great contributions to the settlement of contentious differences in both europe and asia,1925-Coolidge
but there is a very definite point beyond which we can not go,1925-Coolidge
we can only help those who help themselves,1925-Coolidge
mindful of these limitations the one great duty that stands out requires us to use our enormous powers to trim the balance of the world,1925-Coolidge
while we can look with a great deal of pleasure upon what we have done abroad we must remember that our continued success in that direction depends upon what we do at home,1925-Coolidge
since its very outset it has been found necessary to conduct our government by means of political parties,1925-Coolidge
that system would not have survived from generation to generation if it had not been fundamentally sound and provided the best instrumentalities for the most complete expression of the popular will,1925-Coolidge
it is not necessary to claim that it has always worked perfectly,1925-Coolidge
it is enough to know that nothing better has been devised,1925-Coolidge
no one would deny that there should be full and free expression and an opportunity for independence of action within the party,1925-Coolidge
there is no salvation in a narrow and bigoted partisanship,1925-Coolidge
but if there is to be responsible party government the party label must be something more than a mere device for securing office,1925-Coolidge
unless those who are elected under the same party designation are willing to assume sufficient responsibility and exhibit sufficient loyalty and coherence so that they can cooperate with each other in the support of the broad general principles of the party platform the election is merely a mockery no decision is made at the polls and there is no representation of the popular will,1925-Coolidge
common honesty and good faith with the people who support a party at the polls require that party when it enters office to assume the control of that portion of the government to which it has been elected,1925-Coolidge
any other course is bad faith and a violation of the party pledges,1925-Coolidge
when the country has bestowed its confidence upon a party by making it a majority in the congress it has a right to expect such unity of action as will make the party majority an effective instrument of government,1925-Coolidge
this administration has come into power with a very clear and definite mandate from the people,1925-Coolidge
the expression of the popular will in favor of maintaining our constitutional guarantees was overwhelming and decisive,1925-Coolidge
there was a manifestation of such faith in the integrity of the courts that we can consider that issue rejected for some time to come,1925-Coolidge
likewise the policy of public ownership of railroads and certain electric utilities met with unmistakable defeat,1925-Coolidge
the people declared that they wanted their rights to have not a political but a judicial determination and their independence and freedom continued and supported by having the ownership and control of their property not in the government but in their own hands,1925-Coolidge
as they always do when they have a fair chance the people demonstrated that they are sound and are determined to have a sound government,1925-Coolidge
when we turn from what was rejected to inquire what was accepted the policy that stands out with the greatest clearness is that of economy in public expenditure with reduction and reform of taxation,1925-Coolidge
the principle involved in this effort is that of conservation,1925-Coolidge
the resources of this country are almost beyond computation,1925-Coolidge
no mind can comprehend them,1925-Coolidge
but the cost of our combined governments is likewise almost beyond definition,1925-Coolidge
not only those who are now making their tax returns but those who meet the enhanced cost of existence in their monthly bills know by hard experience what this great burden is and what it does,1925-Coolidge
no matter what others may want these people want a drastic economy,1925-Coolidge
they are opposed to waste,1925-Coolidge
they know that extravagance lengthens the hours and diminishes the rewards of their labor,1925-Coolidge
i favor the policy of economy not because i wish to save money but because i wish to save people,1925-Coolidge
the men and women of this country who toil are the ones who bear the cost of the government,1925-Coolidge
every dollar that we carelessly waste means that their life will be so much the more meager,1925-Coolidge
every dollar that we prudently save means that their life will be so much the more abundant,1925-Coolidge
economy is idealism in its most practical form,1925-Coolidge
if extravagance were not reflected in taxation and through taxation both directly and indirectly injuriously affecting the people it would not be of so much consequence,1925-Coolidge
the wisest and soundest method of solving our tax problem is through economy,1925-Coolidge
fortunately of all the great nations this country is best in a position to adopt that simple remedy,1925-Coolidge
we do not any longer need wartime revenues,1925-Coolidge
the collection of any taxes which are not absolutely required which do not beyond reasonable doubt contribute to the public welfare is only a species of legalized larceny,1925-Coolidge
under this republic the rewards of industry belong to those who earn them,1925-Coolidge
the only constitutional tax is the tax which ministers to public necessity,1925-Coolidge
the property of the country belongs to the people of the country,1925-Coolidge
their title is absolute,1925-Coolidge
they do not support any privileged class they do not need to maintain great military forces they ought not to be burdened with a great array of public employees,1925-Coolidge
they are not required to make any contribution to government expenditures except that which they voluntarily assess upon themselves through the action of their own representatives,1925-Coolidge
whenever taxes become burdensome a remedy can be applied by the people but if they do not act for themselves no one can be very successful in acting for them,1925-Coolidge
the time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction when unless we wish to hamper the people in their right to earn a living we must have tax reform,1925-Coolidge
the method of raising revenue ought not to impede the transaction of business it ought to encourage it,1925-Coolidge
i am opposed to extremely high rates because they produce little or no revenue because they are bad for the country and finally because they are wrong,1925-Coolidge
we can not finance the country we can not improve social conditions through any system of injustice even if we attempt to inflict it upon the rich,1925-Coolidge
those who suffer the most harm will be the poor,1925-Coolidge
this country believes in prosperity,1925-Coolidge
it is absurd to suppose that it is envious of those who are already prosperous,1925-Coolidge
the wise and correct course to follow in taxation and all other economic legislation is not to destroy those who have already secured success but to create conditions under which every one will have a better chance to be successful,1925-Coolidge
the verdict of the country has been given on this question,1925-Coolidge
that verdict stands,1925-Coolidge
we shall do well to heed it,1925-Coolidge
these questions involve moral issues,1925-Coolidge
we need not concern ourselves much about the rights of property if we will faithfully observe the rights of persons,1925-Coolidge
under our institutions their rights are supreme,1925-Coolidge
it is not property but the right to hold property both great and small which our constitution guarantees,1925-Coolidge
all owners of property are charged with a service,1925-Coolidge
these rights and duties have been revealed through the conscience of society to have a divine sanction,1925-Coolidge
the very stability of our society rests upon production and conservation,1925-Coolidge
for individuals or for governments to waste and squander their resources is to deny these rights and disregard these obligations,1925-Coolidge
the result of economic dissipation to a nation is always moral decay,1925-Coolidge
these policies of better international understandings greater economy and lower taxes have contributed largely to peaceful and prosperous industrial relations,1925-Coolidge
under the helpful influences of restrictive immigration and a protective tariff employment is plentiful the rate of pay is high and wage earners are in a state of contentment seldom before seen,1925-Coolidge
our transportation systems have been gradually recovering and have been able to meet all the requirements of the service,1925-Coolidge
agriculture has been ver slow in reviving but the price of cereals at last indicates that the day of its deliverance is at hand,1925-Coolidge
we are not without our problems but our most important problem is not to secure new advantages but to maintain those which we already possess,1925-Coolidge
our system of government made up of three separate and independent departments our divided sovereignty composed of nation and state the matchless wisdom that is enshrined in our constitution all these need constant effort and tireless vigilance for their protection and support,1925-Coolidge
in a republic the first rule for the guidance of the citizen is obedience to law,1925-Coolidge
under a despotism the law may be imposed upon the subject,1925-Coolidge
he has no voice in its making no influence in its administration it does not represent him,1925-Coolidge
under a free government the citizen makes his own laws chooses his own administrators which do represent him,1925-Coolidge
those who want their rights respected under the constitution and the law ought to set the example themselves of observing the constitution and the law,1925-Coolidge
while there may be those of high intelligence who violate the law at times the barbarian and the defective always violate it,1925-Coolidge
those who disregard the rules of society are not exhibiting a superior intelligence are not promoting freedom and independence are not following the path of civilization but are displaying the traits of ignorance of servitude of savagery and treading the way that leads back to the jungle,1925-Coolidge
the essence of a republic is representative government,1925-Coolidge
our congress represents the people and the states,1925-Coolidge
in all legislative affairs it is the natural collaborator with the president,1925-Coolidge
in spite of all the criticism which often falls to its lot i do not hesitate to say that there is no more independent and effective legislative body in the world,1925-Coolidge
it is and should be jealous of its prerogative,1925-Coolidge
i welcome its cooperation and expect to share with it not only the responsibility but the credit for our common effort to secure beneficial legislation,1925-Coolidge
these are some of the principles which america represents,1925-Coolidge
we have not by any means put them fully into practice but we have strongly signified our belief in them,1925-Coolidge
the encouraging feature of our country is not that it has reached its destination but that it has overwhelmingly expressed its determination to proceed in the right direction,1925-Coolidge
it is true that we could with profit be less sectional and more national in our thought,1925-Coolidge
it would be well if we could replace much that is only a false and ignorant prejudice with a true and enlightened pride of race,1925-Coolidge
but the last election showed that appeals to class and nationality had little effect,1925-Coolidge
we were all found loyal to a common citizenship,1925-Coolidge
the fundamental precept of liberty is toleration,1925-Coolidge
we can not permit any inquisition either within or without the law or apply any religious test to the holding of office,1925-Coolidge
the mind of america must be forever free,1925-Coolidge
it is in such contemplations my fellow countrymen which are not exhaustive but only representative that i find ample warrant for satisfaction and encouragement,1925-Coolidge
we should not let the much that is to do obscure the much which has been done,1925-Coolidge
the past and present show faith and hope and courage fully justified,1925-Coolidge
here stands our country an example of tranquillity at home a patron of tranquillity abroad,1925-Coolidge
here stands its government aware of its might but obedient to its conscience,1925-Coolidge
here it will continue to stand seeking peace and prosperity solicitous for the welfare of the wage earner promoting enterprise developing waterways and natural resources attentive to the intuitive counsel of womanhood encouraging education desiring the advancement of religion supporting the cause of justice and honor among the nations,1925-Coolidge
america seeks no earthly empire built on blood and force,1925-Coolidge
no ambition no temptation lures her to thought of foreign dominions,1925-Coolidge
the legions which she sends forth are armed not with the sword but with the cross,1925-Coolidge
the higher state to which she seeks the allegiance of all mankind is not of human but of divine origin,1925-Coolidge
she cherishes no purpose save to merit the favor of almighty god,1925-Coolidge
my countrymen this occasion is not alone the administration of the most sacred oath which can be assumed by an american citizen,1929-Hoover
it is a dedication and consecration under god to the highest office in service of our people,1929-Hoover
i assume this trust in the humility of knowledge that only through the guidance of almighty providence can i hope to discharge its ever increasing burdens,1929-Hoover
it is in keeping with tradition throughout our history that i should express simply and directly the opinions which i hold concerning some of the matters of present importance,1929-Hoover
our progress if we survey the situation of our nation both at home and abroad we find many satisfactions we find some causes for concern,1929-Hoover
we have emerged from the losses of the great war and the reconstruction following it with increased virility and strength,1929-Hoover
from this strength we have contributed to the recovery and progress of the world,1929-Hoover
what america has done has given renewed hope and courage to all who have faith in government by the people,1929-Hoover
in the large view we have reached a higher degree of comfort and security than ever existed before in the history of the world,1929-Hoover
through liberation from widespread poverty we have reached a higher degree of individual freedom than ever before,1929-Hoover
the devotion to and concern for our institutions are deep and sincere,1929-Hoover
we are steadily building a new race a new civilization great in its own attainments,1929-Hoover
the influence and high purposes of our nation are respected among the peoples of the world,1929-Hoover
we aspire to distinction in the world but to a distinction based upon confidence in our sense of justice as well as our accomplishments within our own borders and in our own lives,1929-Hoover
for wise guidance in this great period of recovery the nation is deeply indebted to calvin coolidge,1929-Hoover
but all this majestic advance should not obscure the constant dangers from which self government must be safeguarded,1929-Hoover
the strong man must at all times be alert to the attack of insidious disease,1929-Hoover
the failure of our system of criminal justice the most malign of all these dangers today is disregard and disobedience of law,1929-Hoover
crime is increasing,1929-Hoover
confidence in rigid and speedy justice is decreasing,1929-Hoover
i am not prepared to believe that this indicates any decay in the moral fiber of the american people,1929-Hoover
i am not prepared to believe that it indicates an impotence of the federal government to enforce its laws,1929-Hoover
it is only in part due to the additional burdens imposed upon our judicial system by the eighteenth amendment,1929-Hoover
the problem is much wider than that,1929-Hoover
many influences had increasingly complicated and weakened our law enforcement organization long before the adoption of the eighteenth amendment,1929-Hoover
to reestablish the vigor and effectiveness of law enforcement we must critically consider the entire federal machinery of justice the redistribution of its functions the simplification of its procedure the provision of additional special tribunals the better selection of juries and the more effective organization of our agencies of investigation and prosecution that justice may be sure and that it may be swift,1929-Hoover
while the authority of the federal government extends to but part of our vast system of national state and local justice yet the standards which the federal government establishes have the most profound influence upon the whole structure,1929-Hoover
we are fortunate in the ability and integrity of our federal judges and attorneys,1929-Hoover
but the system which these officers are called upon to administer is in many respects ill adapted to present day conditions,1929-Hoover
its intricate and involved rules of procedure have become the refuge of both big and little criminals,1929-Hoover
there is a belief abroad that by invoking technicalities subterfuge and delay the ends of justice may be thwarted by those who can pay the cost,1929-Hoover
reform reorganization and strengthening of our whole judicial and enforcement system both in civil and criminal sides have been advocated for years by statesmen judges and bar associations,1929-Hoover
first steps toward that end should not longer be delayed,1929-Hoover
rigid and expeditious justice is the first safeguard of freedom the basis of all ordered liberty the vital force of progress,1929-Hoover
it must not come to be in our republic that it can be defeated by the indifference of the citizen by exploitation of the delays and entanglements of the law or by combinations of criminals,1929-Hoover
justice must not fail because the agencies of enforcement are either delinquent or inefficiently organized,1929-Hoover
to consider these evils to find their remedy is the most sore necessity of our times,1929-Hoover
enforcement of the eighteenth amendment of the undoubted abuses which have grown up under the eighteenth amendment part are due to the causes i have just mentioned but part are due to the failure of some states to accept their share of responsibility for concurrent enforcement and to the failure of many state and local officials to accept the obligation under their oath of office zealously to enforce the laws,1929-Hoover
with the failures from these many causes has come a dangerous expansion in the criminal elements who have found enlarged opportunities in dealing in illegal liquor,1929-Hoover
but a large responsibility rests directly upon our citizens,1929-Hoover
there would be little traffic in illegal liquor if only criminals patronized it,1929-Hoover
we must awake to the fact that this patronage from large numbers of law abiding citizens is supplying the rewards and stimulating crime,1929-Hoover
i have been selected by you to execute and enforce the laws of the country,1929-Hoover
i propose to do so to the extent of my own abilities but the measure of success that the government shall attain will depend upon the moral support which you as citizens extend,1929-Hoover
the duty of citizens to support the laws of the land is coequal with the duty of their government to enforce the laws which exist,1929-Hoover
no greater national service can be given by men and women of good will who i know are not unmindful of the responsibilities of citizenship than that they should by their example assist in stamping out crime and outlawry by refusing participation in and condemning all transactions with illegal liquor,1929-Hoover
our whole system of self government will crumble either if officials elect what laws they will enforce or citizens elect what laws they will support,1929-Hoover
the worst evil of disregard for some law is that it destroys respect for all law,1929-Hoover
for our citizens to patronize the violation of a particular law on the ground that they are opposed to it is destructive of the very basis of all that protection of life of homes and property which they rightly claim under other laws,1929-Hoover
if citizens do not like a law their duty as honest men and women is to discourage its violation their right is openly to work for its repeal,1929-Hoover
to those of criminal mind there can be no appeal but vigorous enforcement of the law,1929-Hoover
fortunately they are but a small percentage of our people,1929-Hoover
their activities must be stopped,1929-Hoover
a national investigation i propose to appoint a national commission for a searching investigation of the whole structure of our federal system of jurisprudence to include the method of enforcement of the eighteenth amendment and the causes of abuse under it,1929-Hoover
its purpose will be to make such recommendations for reorganization of the administration of federal laws and court procedure as may be found desirable,1929-Hoover
in the meantime it is essential that a large part of the enforcement activities be transferred from the treasury department to the department of justice as a beginning of more effective organization,1929-Hoover
the relation of government to business cooperation by the government the larger purpose of our economic thought should be to establish more firmly stability and security of business and employment and thereby remove poverty still further from our borders,1929-Hoover
our people have in recent years developed a new found capacity for cooperation among themselves to effect high purposes in public welfare,1929-Hoover
it is an advance toward the highest conception of self government,1929-Hoover
self government does not and should not imply the use of political agencies alone,1929-Hoover
progress is born of cooperation in the community not from governmental restraints,1929-Hoover
the government should assist and encourage these movements of collective self help by itself cooperating with them,1929-Hoover
business has by cooperation made great progress in the advancement of service in stability in regularity of employment and in the correction of its own abuses,1929-Hoover
such progress however can continue only so long as business manifests its respect for law,1929-Hoover
there is an equally important field of cooperation by the federal government with the multitude of agencies state municipal and private in the systematic development of those processes which directly affect public health recreation education and the home,1929-Hoover
we have need further to perfect the means by which government can be adapted to human service,1929-Hoover
education although education is primarily a responsibility of the states and local communities and rightly so yet the nation as a whole is vitally concerned in its development everywhere to the highest standards and to complete universality,1929-Hoover
self government can succeed only through an instructed electorate,1929-Hoover
our objective is not simply to overcome illiteracy,1929-Hoover
the nation has marched far beyond that,1929-Hoover
the more complex the problems of the nation become the greater is the need for more and more advanced instruction,1929-Hoover
moreover as our numbers increase and as our life expands with science and invention we must discover more and more leaders for every walk of life,1929-Hoover
we can not hope to succeed in directing this increasingly complex civilization unless we can draw all the talent of leadership from the whole people,1929-Hoover
one civilization after another has been wrecked upon the attempt to secure sufficient leadership from a single group or class,1929-Hoover
if we would prevent the growth of class distinctions and would constantly refresh our leadership with the ideals of our people we must draw constantly from the general mass,1929-Hoover
the full opportunity for every boy and girl to rise through the selective processes of education can alone secure to us this leadership,1929-Hoover
public health in public health the discoveries of science have opened a new era,1929-Hoover
many sections of our country and many groups of our citizens suffer from diseases the eradication of which are mere matters of administration and moderate expenditure,1929-Hoover
public health service should be as fully organized and as universally incorporated into our governmental system as is public education,1929-Hoover
the returns are a thousand fold in economic benefits and infinitely more in reduction of suffering and promotion of human happiness,1929-Hoover
world peace the united states fully accepts the profound truth that our own progress prosperity and peace are interlocked with the progress prosperity and peace of all humanity,1929-Hoover
the whole world is at peace,1929-Hoover
the dangers to a continuation of this peace today are largely the fear and suspicion which still haunt the world,1929-Hoover
no suspicion or fear can be rightly directed toward our country,1929-Hoover
those who have a true understanding of america know that we have no desire for territorial expansion for economic or other domination of other peoples,1929-Hoover
such purposes are repugnant to our ideals of human freedom,1929-Hoover
our form of government is ill adapted to the responsibilities which inevitably follow permanent limitation of the independence of other peoples,1929-Hoover
superficial observers seem to find no destiny for our abounding increase in population in wealth and power except that of imperialism,1929-Hoover
they fail to see that the american people are engrossed in the building for themselves of a new economic system a new social system a new political system all of which are characterized by aspirations of freedom of opportunity and thereby are the negation of imperialism,1929-Hoover
they fail to realize that because of our abounding prosperity our youth are pressing more and more into our institutions of learning that our people are seeking a larger vision through art literature science and travel that they are moving toward stronger moral and spiritual life that from these things our sympathies are broadening beyond the bounds of our nation and race toward their true expression in a real brotherhood of man,1929-Hoover
they fail to see that the idealism of america will lead it to no narrow or selfish channel but inspire it to do its full share as a nation toward the advancement of civilization,1929-Hoover
it will do that not by mere declaration but by taking a practical part in supporting all useful international undertakings,1929-Hoover
we not only desire peace with the world but to see peace maintained throughout the world,1929-Hoover
we wish to advance the reign of justice and reason toward the extinction of force,1929-Hoover
the recent treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy sets an advanced standard in our conception of the relations of nations,1929-Hoover
its acceptance should pave the way to greater limitation of armament the offer of which we sincerely extend to the world,1929-Hoover
but its full realization also implies a greater and greater perfection in the instrumentalities for pacific settlement of controversies between nations,1929-Hoover
in the creation and use of these instrumentalities we should support every sound method of conciliation arbitration and judicial settlement,1929-Hoover
american statesmen were among the first to propose and they have constantly urged upon the world the establishment of a tribunal for the settlement of controversies of a justiciable character,1929-Hoover
the permanent court of international justice in its major purpose is thus peculiarly identified with american ideals and with american statesmanship,1929-Hoover
no more potent instrumentality for this purpose has ever been conceived and no other is practicable of establishment,1929-Hoover
the reservations placed upon our adherence should not be misinterpreted,1929-Hoover
the united states seeks by these reservations no special privilege or advantage but only to clarify our relation to advisory opinions and other matters which are subsidiary to the major purpose of the court,1929-Hoover
the way should and i believe will be found by which we may take our proper place in a movement so fundamental to the progress of peace,1929-Hoover
our people have determined that we should make no political engagements such as membership in the league of nations which may commit us in advance as a nation to become involved in the settlements of controversies between other countries,1929-Hoover
they adhere to the belief that the independence of america from such obligations increases its ability and availability for service in all fields of human progress,1929-Hoover
i have lately returned from a journey among our sister republics of the western hemisphere,1929-Hoover
i have received unbounded hospitality and courtesy as their expression of friendliness to our country,1929-Hoover
we are held by particular bonds of sympathy and common interest with them,1929-Hoover
they are each of them building a racial character and a culture which is an impressive contribution to human progress,1929-Hoover
we wish only for the maintenance of their independence the growth of their stability and their prosperity,1929-Hoover
while we have had wars in the western hemisphere yet on the whole the record is in encouraging contrast with that of other parts of the world,1929-Hoover
fortunately the new world is largely free from the inheritances of fear and distrust which have so troubled the old world,1929-Hoover
we should keep it so,1929-Hoover
it is impossible my countrymen to speak of peace without profound emotion,1929-Hoover
in thousands of homes in america in millions of homes around the world there are vacant chairs,1929-Hoover
it would be a shameful confession of our unworthiness if it should develop that we have abandoned the hope for which all these men died,1929-Hoover
surely civilization is old enough surely mankind is mature enough so that we ought in our own lifetime to find a way to permanent peace,1929-Hoover
abroad to west and east are nations whose sons mingled their blood with the blood of our sons on the battlefields,1929-Hoover
most of these nations have contributed to our race to our culture our knowledge and our progress,1929-Hoover
from one of them we derive our very language and from many of them much of the genius of our institutions,1929-Hoover
their desire for peace is as deep and sincere as our own,1929-Hoover
peace can be contributed to by respect for our ability in defense,1929-Hoover
peace can be promoted by the limitation of arms and by the creation of the instrumentalities for peaceful settlement of controversies,1929-Hoover
but it will become a reality only through self restraint and active effort in friendliness and helpfulness,1929-Hoover
i covet for this administration a record of having further contributed to advance the cause of peace,1929-Hoover
party responsibilities in our form of democracy the expression of the popular will can be effected only through the instrumentality of political parties,1929-Hoover
we maintain party government not to promote intolerant partisanship but because opportunity must be given for expression of the popular will and organization provided for the execution of its mandates and for accountability of government to the people,1929-Hoover
it follows that the government both in the executive and the legislative branches must carry out in good faith the platforms upon which the party was entrusted with power,1929-Hoover
but the government is that of the whole people the party is the instrument through which policies are determined and men chosen to bring them into being,1929-Hoover
the animosities of elections should have no place in our government for government must concern itself alone with the common weal,1929-Hoover
special session of the congress action upon some of the proposals upon which the republican party was returned to power particularly further agricultural relief and limited changes in the tariff cannot in justice to our farmers our labor and our manufacturers be postponed,1929-Hoover
i shall therefore request a special session of congress for the consideration of these two questions,1929-Hoover
i shall deal with each of them upon the assembly of the congress,1929-Hoover
other mandates from the election it appears to me that the more important further mandates from the recent election were the maintenance of the integrity of the constitution the vigorous enforcement of the laws the continuance of economy in public expenditure the continued regulation of business to prevent domination in the community the denial of ownership or operation of business by the government in competition with its citizens the avoidance of policies which would involve us in the controversies of foreign nations the more effective reorganization of the departments of the federal government the expansion of public works and the promotion of welfare activities affecting education and the home,1929-Hoover
these were the more tangible determinations of the election but beyond them was the confidence and belief of the people that we would not neglect the support of the embedded ideals and aspirations of america,1929-Hoover
these ideals and aspirations are the touchstones upon which the day to day administration and legislative acts of government must be tested,1929-Hoover
more than this the government must so far as lies within its proper powers give leadership to the realization of these ideals and to the fruition of these aspirations,1929-Hoover
no one can adequately reduce these things of the spirit to phrases or to a catalogue of definitions,1929-Hoover
we do know what the attainments of these ideals should be the preservation of self government and its full foundations in local government the perfection of justice whether in economic or in social fields the maintenance of ordered liberty the denial of domination by any group or class the building up and preservation of equality of opportunity the stimulation of initiative and individuality absolute integrity in public affairs the choice of officials for fitness to office the direction of economic progress toward prosperity for the further lessening of poverty the freedom of public opinion the sustaining of education and of the advancement of knowledge the growth of religious spirit and the tolerance of all faiths the strengthening of the home the advancement of peace,1929-Hoover
there is no short road to the realization of these aspirations,1929-Hoover
ours is a progressive people but with a determination that progress must be based upon the foundation of experience,1929-Hoover
ill considered remedies for our faults bring only penalties after them,1929-Hoover
but if we hold the faith of the men in our mighty past who created these ideals we shall leave them heightened and strengthened for our children,1929-Hoover
conclusion this is not the time and place for extended discussion,1929-Hoover
the questions before our country are problems of progress to higher standards they are not the problems of degeneration,1929-Hoover
they demand thought and they serve to quicken the conscience and enlist our sense of responsibility for their settlement,1929-Hoover
and that responsibility rests upon you my countrymen as much as upon those of us who have been selected for office,1929-Hoover
ours is a land rich in resources stimulating in its glorious beauty filled with millions of happy homes blessed with comfort and opportunity,1929-Hoover
in no nation are the institutions of progress more advanced,1929-Hoover
in no nation are the fruits of accomplishment more secure,1929-Hoover
in no nation is the government more worthy of respect,1929-Hoover
no country is more loved by its people,1929-Hoover
i have an abiding faith in their capacity integrity and high purpose,1929-Hoover
i have no fears for the future of our country,1929-Hoover
it is bright with hope,1929-Hoover
in the presence of my countrymen mindful of the solemnity of this occasion knowing what the task means and the responsibility which it involves i beg your tolerance your aid and your cooperation,1929-Hoover
i ask the help of almighty god in this service to my country to which you have called me,1929-Hoover
i am certain that my fellow americans expect that on my induction into the presidency i will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our nation impels,1933-Roosevelt
this is preeminently the time to speak the truth the whole truth frankly and boldly,1933-Roosevelt
nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today,1933-Roosevelt
this great nation will endure as it has endured will revive and will prosper,1933-Roosevelt
so first of all let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself nameless unreasoning unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance,1933-Roosevelt
in every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory,1933-Roosevelt
i am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days,1933-Roosevelt
in such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties,1933-Roosevelt
they concern thank god only material things,1933-Roosevelt
values have shrunken to fantastic levels taxes have risen our ability to pay has fallen government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side farmers find no markets for their produce the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone,1933-Roosevelt
more important a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence and an equally great number toil with little return,1933-Roosevelt
only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment,1933-Roosevelt
yet our distress comes from no failure of substance,1933-Roosevelt
we are stricken by no plague of locusts,1933-Roosevelt
compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered because they believed and were not afraid we have still much to be thankful for,1933-Roosevelt
nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it,1933-Roosevelt
plenty is at our doorstep but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply,1933-Roosevelt
primarily this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind s goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence have admitted their failure and abdicated,1933-Roosevelt
practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion rejected by the hearts and minds of men,1933-Roosevelt
true they have tried but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition,1933-Roosevelt
faced by failure of credit they have proposed only the lending of more money,1933-Roosevelt
stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership they have resorted to exhortations pleading tearfully for restored confidence,1933-Roosevelt
they know only the rules of a generation of self seekers,1933-Roosevelt
they have no vision and when there is no vision the people perish,1933-Roosevelt
the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization,1933-Roosevelt
we may now restore that temple to the ancient truths,1933-Roosevelt
the measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit,1933-Roosevelt
happiness lies not in the mere possession of money it lies in the joy of achievement in the thrill of creative effort,1933-Roosevelt
the joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits,1933-Roosevelt
these dark days will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow men,1933-Roosevelt
recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing,1933-Roosevelt
small wonder that confidence languishes for it thrives only on honesty on honor on the sacredness of obligations on faithful protection on unselfish performance without them it cannot live,1933-Roosevelt
restoration calls however not for changes in ethics alone,1933-Roosevelt
this nation asks for action and action now,1933-Roosevelt
our greatest primary task is to put people to work,1933-Roosevelt
this is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously,1933-Roosevelt
it can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the government itself treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war but at the same time through this employment accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources,1933-Roosevelt
hand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our industrial centers and by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land,1933-Roosevelt
the task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities,1933-Roosevelt
it can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and our farms,1933-Roosevelt
it can be helped by insistence that the federal state and local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced,1933-Roosevelt
it can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered uneconomical and unequal,1933-Roosevelt
it can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character,1933-Roosevelt
there are many ways in which it can be helped but it can never be helped merely by talking about it,1933-Roosevelt
we must act and act quickly,1933-Roosevelt
finally in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments there must be an end to speculation with other people s money and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency,1933-Roosevelt
there are the lines of attack,1933-Roosevelt
i shall presently urge upon a new congress in special session detailed measures for their fulfillment and i shall seek the immediate assistance of the several states,1933-Roosevelt
through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making income balance outgo,1933-Roosevelt
our international trade relations though vastly important are in point of time and necessity secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy,1933-Roosevelt
i favor as a practical policy the putting of first things first,1933-Roosevelt
i shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment,1933-Roosevelt
the basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not narrowly nationalistic,1933-Roosevelt
it is the insistence as a first consideration upon the interdependence of the various elements in all parts of the united states a recognition of the old and permanently important manifestation of the american spirit of the pioneer,1933-Roosevelt
it is the way to recovery,1933-Roosevelt
it is the immediate way,1933-Roosevelt
it is the strongest assurance that the recovery will endure,1933-Roosevelt
in the field of world policy i would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and because he does so respects the rights of others the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors,1933-Roosevelt
if i read the temper of our people correctly we now realize as we have never realized before our interdependence on each other that we can not merely take but we must give as well that if we are to go forward we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline because without such discipline no progress is made no leadership becomes effective,1933-Roosevelt
we are i know ready and willing to submit our lives and property to such discipline because it makes possible a leadership which aims at a larger good,1933-Roosevelt
this i propose to offer pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in time of armed strife,1933-Roosevelt
with this pledge taken i assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems,1933-Roosevelt
action in this image and to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors,1933-Roosevelt
our constitution is so simple and practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form,1933-Roosevelt
that is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has produced,1933-Roosevelt
it has met every stress of vast expansion of territory of foreign wars of bitter internal strife of world relations,1933-Roosevelt
it is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority may be wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us,1933-Roosevelt
but it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure,1933-Roosevelt
i am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require,1933-Roosevelt
these measures or such other measures as the congress may build out of its experience and wisdom i shall seek within my constitutional authority to bring to speedy adoption,1933-Roosevelt
but in the event that the congress shall fail to take one of these two courses and in the event that the national emergency is still critical i shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me,1933-Roosevelt
i shall ask the congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe,1933-Roosevelt
for the trust reposed in me i will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time,1933-Roosevelt
i can do no less,1933-Roosevelt
we face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of the national unity with the clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values with the clean satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of duty by old and young alike,1933-Roosevelt
we aim at the assurance of a rounded and permanent national life,1933-Roosevelt
we do not distrust the future of essential democracy,1933-Roosevelt
the people of the united states have not failed,1933-Roosevelt
in their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct vigorous action,1933-Roosevelt
they have asked for discipline and direction under leadership,1933-Roosevelt
they have made me the present instrument of their wishes,1933-Roosevelt
in the spirit of the gift i take it,1933-Roosevelt
in this dedication of a nation we humbly ask the blessing of god,1933-Roosevelt
may he protect each and every one of us,1933-Roosevelt
may he guide me in the days to come,1933-Roosevelt
when four years ago we met to inaugurate a president the republic single minded in anxiety stood in spirit here,1937-Roosevelt
we dedicated ourselves to the fulfillment of a vision to speed the time when there would be for all the people that security and peace essential to the pursuit of happiness,1937-Roosevelt
we of the republic pledged ourselves to drive from the temple of our ancient faith those who had profaned it to end by action tireless and unafraid the stagnation and despair of that day,1937-Roosevelt
we did those first things first,1937-Roosevelt
our covenant with ourselves did not stop there,1937-Roosevelt
instinctively we recognized a deeper need the need to find through government the instrument of our united purpose to solve for the individual the ever rising problems of a complex civilization,1937-Roosevelt
repeated attempts at their solution without the aid of government had left us baffled and bewildered,1937-Roosevelt
for without that aid we had been unable to create those moral controls over the services of science which are necessary to make science a useful servant instead of a ruthless master of mankind,1937-Roosevelt
to do this we knew that we must find practical controls over blind economic forces and blindly selfish men,1937-Roosevelt
we of the republic sensed the truth that democratic government has innate capacity to protect its people against disasters once considered inevitable to solve problems once considered unsolvable,1937-Roosevelt
we would not admit that we could not find a way to master economic epidemics just as after centuries of fatalistic suffering we had found a way to master epidemics of disease,1937-Roosevelt
we refused to leave the problems of our common welfare to be solved by the winds of chance and the hurricanes of disaster,1937-Roosevelt
in this we americans were discovering no wholly new truth we were writing a new chapter in our book of self government,1937-Roosevelt
this year marks the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the constitutional convention which made us a nation,1937-Roosevelt
at that convention our forefathers found the way out of the chaos which followed the revolutionary war they created a strong government with powers of united action sufficient then and now to solve problems utterly beyond individual or local solution,1937-Roosevelt
a century and a half ago they established the federal government in order to promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to the american people,1937-Roosevelt
today we invoke those same powers of government to achieve the same objectives,1937-Roosevelt
four years of new experience have not belied our historic instinct,1937-Roosevelt
they hold out the clear hope that government within communities government within the separate states and government of the united states can do the things the times require without yielding its democracy,1937-Roosevelt
our tasks in the last four years did not force democracy to take a holiday,1937-Roosevelt
nearly all of us recognize that as intricacies of human relationships increase so power to govern them also must increase power to stop evil power to do good,1937-Roosevelt
the essential democracy of our nation and the safety of our people depend not upon the absence of power but upon lodging it with those whom the people can change or continue at stated intervals through an honest and free system of elections,1937-Roosevelt
the constitution of 1787 did not make our democracy impotent,1937-Roosevelt
in fact in these last four years we have made the exercise of all power more democratic for we have begun to bring private autocratic powers into their proper subordination to the public s government,1937-Roosevelt
the legend that they were invincible above and beyond the processes of a democracy has been shattered,1937-Roosevelt
they have been challenged and beaten,1937-Roosevelt
our progress out of the depression is obvious,1937-Roosevelt
but that is not all that you and i mean by the new order of things,1937-Roosevelt
our pledge was not merely to do a patchwork job with secondhand materials,1937-Roosevelt
by using the new materials of social justice we have undertaken to erect on the old foundations a more enduring structure for the better use of future generations,1937-Roosevelt
in that purpose we have been helped by achievements of mind and spirit,1937-Roosevelt
old truths have been relearned untruths have been unlearned,1937-Roosevelt
we have always known that heedless self interest was bad morals we know now that it is bad economics,1937-Roosevelt
out of the collapse of a prosperity whose builders boasted their practicality has come the conviction that in the long run economic morality pays,1937-Roosevelt
we are beginning to wipe out the line that divides the practical from the ideal and in so doing we are fashioning an instrument of unimagined power for the establishment of a morally better world,1937-Roosevelt
this new understanding undermines the old admiration of worldly success as such,1937-Roosevelt
we are beginning to abandon our tolerance of the abuse of power by those who betray for profit the elementary decencies of life,1937-Roosevelt
in this process evil things formerly accepted will not be so easily condoned,1937-Roosevelt
hard headedness will not so easily excuse hardheartedness,1937-Roosevelt
we are moving toward an era of good feeling,1937-Roosevelt
but we realize that there can be no era of good feeling save among men of good will,1937-Roosevelt
for these reasons i am justified in believing that the greatest change we have witnessed has been the change in the moral climate of america,1937-Roosevelt
among men of good will science and democracy together offer an ever richer life and ever larger satisfaction to the individual,1937-Roosevelt
with this change in our moral climate and our rediscovered ability to improve our economic order we have set our feet upon the road of enduring progress,1937-Roosevelt
shall we pause now and turn our back upon the road that lies ahead,1937-Roosevelt
shall we call this the promised land,1937-Roosevelt
or shall we continue on our way,1937-Roosevelt
for each age is a dream that is dying or one that is coming to birth,1937-Roosevelt
many voices are heard as we face a great decision,1937-Roosevelt
comfort says tarry a while,1937-Roosevelt
opportunism says this is a good spot,1937-Roosevelt
timidity asks how difficult is the road ahead,1937-Roosevelt
true we have come far from the days of stagnation and despair,1937-Roosevelt
vitality has been preserved,1937-Roosevelt
courage and confidence have been restored,1937-Roosevelt
mental and moral horizons have been extended,1937-Roosevelt
but our present gains were won under the pressure of more than ordinary circumstances,1937-Roosevelt
advance became imperative under the goad of fear and suffering,1937-Roosevelt
the times were on the side of progress,1937-Roosevelt
to hold to progress today however is more difficult,1937-Roosevelt
dulled conscience irresponsibility and ruthless self interest already reappear,1937-Roosevelt
such symptoms of prosperity may become portents of disaster,1937-Roosevelt
prosperity already tests the persistence of our progressive purpose,1937-Roosevelt
let us ask again have we reached the goal of our vision of that fourth day of march 1933,1937-Roosevelt
have we found our happy valley,1937-Roosevelt
i see a great nation upon a great continent blessed with a great wealth of natural resources,1937-Roosevelt
its hundred and thirty million people are at peace among themselves they are making their country a good neighbor among the nations,1937-Roosevelt
i see a united states which can demonstrate that under democratic methods of government national wealth can be translated into a spreading volume of human comforts hitherto unknown and the lowest standard of living can be raised far above the level of mere subsistence,1937-Roosevelt
but here is the challenge to our democracy in this nation i see tens of millions of its citizens a substantial part of its whole population who at this very moment are denied the greater part of what the very lowest standards of today call the necessities of life,1937-Roosevelt
i see millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hangs over them day by day,1937-Roosevelt
i see millions whose daily lives in city and on farm continue under conditions labeled indecent by a so called polite society half a century ago,1937-Roosevelt
i see millions denied education recreation and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children,1937-Roosevelt
i see millions lacking the means to buy the products of farm and factory and by their poverty denying work and productiveness to many other millions,1937-Roosevelt
i see one third of a nation ill housed ill clad ill nourished,1937-Roosevelt
it is not in despair that i paint you that picture,1937-Roosevelt
i paint it for you in hope because the nation seeing and understanding the injustice in it proposes to paint it out,1937-Roosevelt
we are determined to make every american citizen the subject of his country s interest and concern and we will never regard any faithful law abiding group within our borders as superfluous,1937-Roosevelt
the test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little,1937-Roosevelt
if i know aught of the spirit and purpose of our nation we will not listen to comfort opportunism and timidity,1937-Roosevelt
we will carry on,1937-Roosevelt
overwhelmingly we of the republic are men and women of good will men and women who have more than warm hearts of dedication men and women who have cool heads and willing hands of practical purpose as well,1937-Roosevelt
they will insist that every agency of popular government use effective instruments to carry out their will,1937-Roosevelt
government is competent when all who compose it work as trustees for the whole people,1937-Roosevelt
it can make constant progress when it keeps abreast of all the facts,1937-Roosevelt
it can obtain justified support and legitimate criticism when the people receive true information of all that government does,1937-Roosevelt
if i know aught of the will of our people they will demand that these conditions of effective government shall be created and maintained,1937-Roosevelt
they will demand a nation uncorrupted by cancers of injustice and therefore strong among the nations in its example of the will to peace,1937-Roosevelt
today we reconsecrate our country to long cherished ideals in a suddenly changed civilization,1937-Roosevelt
in every land there are always at work forces that drive men apart and forces that draw men together,1937-Roosevelt
in our personal ambitions we are individualists,1937-Roosevelt
but in our seeking for economic and political progress as a nation we all go up or else we all go down as one people,1937-Roosevelt
to maintain a democracy of effort requires a vast amount of patience in dealing with differing methods a vast amount of humility,1937-Roosevelt
but out of the confusion of many voices rises an understanding of dominant public need,1937-Roosevelt
then political leadership can voice common ideals and aid in their realization,1937-Roosevelt
in taking again the oath of office as president of the united states i assume the solemn obligation of leading the american people forward along the road over which they have chosen to advance,1937-Roosevelt
while this duty rests upon me i shall do my utmost to speak their purpose and to do their will seeking divine guidance to help us each and every one to give light to them that sit in darkness and to guide our feet into the way of peace,1937-Roosevelt
on each national day of inauguration since 1789 the people have renewed their sense of dedication to the united states,1941-Roosevelt
in washington s day the task of the people was to create and weld together a nation,1941-Roosevelt
in lincoln s day the task of the people was to preserve that nation from disruption from within,1941-Roosevelt
in this day the task of the people is to save that nation and its institutions from disruption from without,1941-Roosevelt
to us there has come a time in the midst of swift happenings to pause for a moment and take stock to recall what our place in history has been and to rediscover what we are and what we may be,1941-Roosevelt
if we do not we risk the real peril of inaction,1941-Roosevelt
lives of nations are determined not by the count of years but by the lifetime of the human spirit,1941-Roosevelt
the life of a man is three score years and ten a little more a little less,1941-Roosevelt
the life of a nation is the fullness of the measure of its will to live,1941-Roosevelt
there are men who doubt this,1941-Roosevelt
there are men who believe that democracy as a form of government and a frame of life is limited or measured by a kind of mystical and artificial fate that for some unexplained reason tyranny and slavery have become the surging wave of the future and that freedom is an ebbing tide,1941-Roosevelt
but we americans know that this is not true,1941-Roosevelt
eight years ago when the life of this republic seemed frozen by a fatalistic terror we proved that this is not true,1941-Roosevelt
we were in the midst of shock but we acted,1941-Roosevelt
we acted quickly boldly decisively,1941-Roosevelt
these later years have been living years fruitful years for the people of this democracy,1941-Roosevelt
for they have brought to us greater security and i hope a better understanding that life s ideals are to be measured in other than material things,1941-Roosevelt
most vital to our present and our future is this experience of a democracy which successfully survived crisis at home put away many evil things built new structures on enduring lines and through it all maintained the fact of its democracy,1941-Roosevelt
for action has been taken within the three way framework of the constitution of the united states,1941-Roosevelt
the coordinate branches of the government continue freely to function,1941-Roosevelt
the bill of rights remains inviolate,1941-Roosevelt
the freedom of elections is wholly maintained,1941-Roosevelt
prophets of the downfall of american democracy have seen their dire predictions come to naught,1941-Roosevelt
democracy is not dying,1941-Roosevelt
we know it because we have seen it revive and grow,1941-Roosevelt
we know it cannot die because it is built on the unhampered initiative of individual men and women joined together in a common enterprise an enterprise undertaken and carried through by the free expression of a free majority,1941-Roosevelt
we know it because democracy alone of all forms of government enlists the full force of men s enlightened will,1941-Roosevelt
we know it because democracy alone has constructed an unlimited civilization capable of infinite progress in the improvement of human life,1941-Roosevelt
we know it because if we look below the surface we sense it still spreading on every continent for it is the most humane the most advanced and in the end the most unconquerable of all forms of human society,1941-Roosevelt
a nation like a person has a body a body that must be fed and clothed and housed invigorated and rested in a manner that measures up to the objectives of our time,1941-Roosevelt
a nation like a person has a mind a mind that must be kept informed and alert that must know itself that understands the hopes and the needs of its neighbors all the other nations that live within the narrowing circle of the world,1941-Roosevelt
and a nation like a person has something deeper something more permanent something larger than the sum of all its parts,1941-Roosevelt
it is that something which matters most to its future which calls forth the most sacred guarding of its present,1941-Roosevelt
it is a thing for which we find it difficult even impossible to hit upon a single simple word,1941-Roosevelt
and yet we all understand what it is the spirit the faith of america,1941-Roosevelt
it is the product of centuries,1941-Roosevelt
it was born in the multitudes of those who came from many lands some of high degree but mostly plain people who sought here early and late to find freedom more freely,1941-Roosevelt
the democratic aspiration is no mere recent phase in human history,1941-Roosevelt
it is human history,1941-Roosevelt
it permeated the ancient life of early peoples,1941-Roosevelt
it blazed anew in the middle ages,1941-Roosevelt
it was written in magna charta,1941-Roosevelt
in the americas its impact has been irresistible,1941-Roosevelt
america has been the new world in all tongues to all peoples not because this continent was a new found land but because all those who came here believed they could create upon this continent a new life a life that should be new in freedom,1941-Roosevelt
its vitality was written into our own mayflower compact into the declaration of independence into the constitution of the united states into the gettysburg address,1941-Roosevelt
those who first came here to carry out the longings of their spirit and the millions who followed and the stock that sprang from them all have moved forward constantly and consistently toward an ideal which in itself has gained stature and clarity with each generation,1941-Roosevelt
the hopes of the republic cannot forever tolerate either undeserved poverty or self serving wealth,1941-Roosevelt
we know that we still have far to go that we must more greatly build the security and the opportunity and the knowledge of every citizen in the measure justified by the resources and the capacity of the land,1941-Roosevelt
but it is not enough to achieve these purposes alone,1941-Roosevelt
it is not enough to clothe and feed the body of this nation and instruct and inform its mind,1941-Roosevelt
for there is also the spirit,1941-Roosevelt
and of the three the greatest is the spirit,1941-Roosevelt
without the body and the mind as all men know the nation could not live,1941-Roosevelt
but if the spirit of america were killed even though the nation s body and mind constricted in an alien world lived on the america we know would have perished,1941-Roosevelt
that spirit that faith speaks to us in our daily lives in ways often unnoticed because they seem so obvious,1941-Roosevelt
it speaks to us here in the capital of the nation,1941-Roosevelt
it speaks to us through the processes of governing in the sovereignties of 48 states,1941-Roosevelt
it speaks to us in our counties in our cities in our towns and in our villages,1941-Roosevelt
it speaks to us from the other nations of the hemisphere and from those across the seas the enslaved as well as the free,1941-Roosevelt
sometimes we fail to hear or heed these voices of freedom because to us the privilege of our freedom is such an old old story,1941-Roosevelt
the destiny of america was proclaimed in words of prophecy spoken by our first president in his first inaugural in 1789 words almost directed it would seem to this year of 1941 the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered deeply finally staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands of the american people,1941-Roosevelt
if we lose that sacred fire if we let it be smothered with doubt and fear then we shall reject the destiny which washington strove so valiantly and so triumphantly to establish,1941-Roosevelt
the preservation of the spirit and faith of the nation does and will furnish the highest justification for every sacrifice that we may make in the cause of national defense,1941-Roosevelt
in the face of great perils never before encountered our strong purpose is to protect and to perpetuate the integrity of democracy,1941-Roosevelt
for this we muster the spirit of america and the faith of america,1941-Roosevelt
we do not retreat,1941-Roosevelt
we are not content to stand still,1941-Roosevelt
as americans we go forward in the service of our country by the will of god,1941-Roosevelt
chief justice mr vice president my friends you will understand and i believe agree with my wish that the form of this inauguration be simple and its words brief,1945-Roosevelt
we americans of today together with our allies are passing through a period of supreme test,1945-Roosevelt
it is a test of our courage of our resolve of our wisdom our essential democracy,1945-Roosevelt
if we meet that test successfully and honorably we shall perform a service of historic importance which men and women and children will honor throughout all time,1945-Roosevelt
as i stand here today having taken the solemn oath of office in the presence of my fellow countrymen in the presence of our god i know that it is america s purpose that we shall not fail,1945-Roosevelt
in the days and in the years that are to come we shall work for a just and honorable peace a durable peace as today we work and fight for total victory in war,1945-Roosevelt
we can and we will achieve such a peace,1945-Roosevelt
we shall strive for perfection,1945-Roosevelt
we shall not achieve it immediately but we still shall strive,1945-Roosevelt
we may make mistakes but they must never be mistakes which result from faintness of heart or abandonment of moral principle,1945-Roosevelt
i remember that my old schoolmaster dr peabody said in days that seemed to us then to be secure and untroubled things in life will not always run smoothly,1945-Roosevelt
sometimes we will be rising toward the heights then all will seem to reverse itself and start downward,1945-Roosevelt
the great fact to remember is that the trend of civilization itself is forever upward that a line drawn through the middle of the peaks and the valleys of the centuries always has an upward trend,1945-Roosevelt
our constitution of 1787 was not a perfect instrument it is not perfect yet,1945-Roosevelt
but it provided a firm base upon which all manner of men of all races and colors and creeds could build our solid structure of democracy,1945-Roosevelt
and so today in this year of war 1945 we have learned lessons at a fearful cost and we shall profit by them,1945-Roosevelt
we have learned that we cannot live alone at peace that our own well being is dependent on the well being of other nations far away,1945-Roosevelt
we have learned that we must live as men not as ostriches nor as dogs in the manger,1945-Roosevelt
we have learned to be citizens of the world members of the human community,1945-Roosevelt
we have learned the simple truth as emerson said that the only way to have a friend is to be one,1945-Roosevelt
we can gain no lasting peace if we approach it with suspicion and mistrust or with fear,1945-Roosevelt
we can gain it only if we proceed with the understanding the confidence and the courage which flow from conviction,1945-Roosevelt
the almighty god has blessed our land in many ways,1945-Roosevelt
he has given our people stout hearts and strong arms with which to strike mighty blows for freedom and truth,1945-Roosevelt
he has given to our country a faith which has become the hope of all peoples in an anguished world,1945-Roosevelt
so we pray to him now for the vision to see our way clearly to see the way that leads to a better life for ourselves and for all our fellow men to the achievement of his will to peace on earth,1945-Roosevelt
mr vice president mr chief justice and fellow citizens i accept with humility the honor which the american people have conferred upon me,1949-Truman
i accept it with a deep resolve to do all that i can for the welfare of this nation and for the peace of the world,1949-Truman
in performing the duties of my office i need the help and prayers of every one of you,1949-Truman
i ask for your encouragement and your support,1949-Truman
the tasks we face are difficult and we can accomplish them only if we work together,1949-Truman
each period of our national history has had its special challenges,1949-Truman
those that confront us now are as momentous as any in the past,1949-Truman
today marks the beginning not only of a new administration but of a period that will be eventful perhaps decisive for us and for the world,1949-Truman
it may be our lot to experience and in large measure to bring about a major turning point in the long history of the human race,1949-Truman
the first half of this century has been marked by unprecedented and brutal attacks on the rights of man and by the two most frightful wars in history,1949-Truman
the supreme need of our time is for men to learn to live together in peace and harmony,1949-Truman
the peoples of the earth face the future with grave uncertainty composed almost equally of great hopes and great fears,1949-Truman
in this time of doubt they look to the united states as never before for good will strength and wise leadership,1949-Truman
it is fitting therefore that we take this occasion to proclaim to the world the essential principles of the faith by which we live and to declare our aims to all peoples,1949-Truman
the american people stand firm in the faith which has inspired this nation from the beginning,1949-Truman
we believe that all men have a right to equal justice under law and equal opportunity to share in the common good,1949-Truman
we believe that all men have the right to freedom of thought and expression,1949-Truman
we believe that all men are created equal because they are created in the image of god,1949-Truman
from this faith we will not be moved,1949-Truman
the american people desire and are determined to work for a world in which all nations and all peoples are free to govern themselves as they see fit and to achieve a decent and satisfying life,1949-Truman
above all else our people desire and are determined to work for peace on earth a just and lasting peace based on genuine agreement freely arrived at by equals,1949-Truman
in the pursuit of these aims the united states and other like minded nations find themselves directly opposed by a regime with contrary aims and a totally different concept of life,1949-Truman
that regime adheres to a false philosophy which purports to offer freedom security and greater opportunity to mankind,1949-Truman
misled by this philosophy many peoples have sacrificed their liberties only to learn to their sorrow that deceit and mockery poverty and tyranny are their reward,1949-Truman
that false philosophy is communism,1949-Truman
communism is based on the belief that man is so weak and inadequate that he is unable to govern himself and therefore requires the rule of strong masters,1949-Truman
democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral and intellectual capacity as well as the inalienable right to govern himself with reason and justice,1949-Truman
communism subjects the individual to arrest without lawful cause punishment without trial and forced labor as the chattel of the state,1949-Truman
it decrees what information he shall receive what art he shall produce what leaders he shall follow and what thoughts he shall think,1949-Truman
democracy maintains that government is established for the benefit of the individual and is charged with the responsibility of protecting the rights of the individual and his freedom in the exercise of his abilities,1949-Truman
communism maintains that social wrongs can be corrected only by violence,1949-Truman
democracy has proved that social justice can be achieved through peaceful change,1949-Truman
communism holds that the world is so deeply divided into opposing classes that war is inevitable,1949-Truman
democracy holds that free nations can settle differences justly and maintain lasting peace,1949-Truman
these differences between communism and democracy do not concern the united states alone,1949-Truman
people everywhere are coming to realize that what is involved is material well being human dignity and the right to believe in and worship god,1949-Truman
i state these differences not to draw issues of belief as such but because the actions resulting from the communist philosophy are a threat to the efforts of free nations to bring about world recovery and lasting peace,1949-Truman
since the end of hostilities the united states has invested its substance and its energy in a great constructive effort to restore peace stability and freedom to the world,1949-Truman
we have sought no territory and we have imposed our will on none,1949-Truman
we have asked for no privileges we would not extend to others,1949-Truman
we have constantly and vigorously supported the united nations and related agencies as a means of applying democratic principles to international relations,1949-Truman
we have consistently advocated and relied upon peaceful settlement of disputes among nations,1949-Truman
we have made every effort to secure agreement on effective international control of our most powerful weapon and we have worked steadily for the limitation and control of all armaments,1949-Truman
we have encouraged by precept and example the expansion of world trade on a sound and fair basis,1949-Truman
almost a year ago in company with 16 free nations of europe we launched the greatest cooperative economic program in history,1949-Truman
the purpose of that unprecedented effort is to invigorate and strengthen democracy in europe so that the free people of that continent can resume their rightful place in the forefront of civilization and can contribute once more to the security and welfare of the world,1949-Truman
our efforts have brought new hope to all mankind,1949-Truman
we have beaten back despair and defeatism,1949-Truman
we have saved a number of countries from losing their liberty,1949-Truman
hundreds of millions of people all over the world now agree with us that we need not have war that we can have peace,1949-Truman
the initiative is ours,1949-Truman
we are moving on with other nations to build an even stronger structure of international order and justice,1949-Truman
we shall have as our partners countries which no longer solely concerned with the problem of national survival are now working to improve the standards of living of all their people,1949-Truman
we are ready to undertake new projects to strengthen the free world,1949-Truman
in the coming years our program for peace and freedom will emphasize four major courses of action,1949-Truman
first we will continue to give unfaltering support to the united nations and related agencies and we will continue to search for ways to strengthen their authority and increase their effectiveness,1949-Truman
we believe that the united nations will be strengthened by the new nations which are being formed in lands now advancing toward self government under democratic principles,1949-Truman
second we will continue our programs for world economic recovery,1949-Truman
this means first of all that we must keep our full weight behind the european recovery program,1949-Truman
we are confident of the success of this major venture in world recovery,1949-Truman
we believe that our partners in this effort will achieve the status of self supporting nations once again,1949-Truman
in addition we must carry out our plans for reducing the barriers to world trade and increasing its volume,1949-Truman
economic recovery and peace itself depend on increased world trade,1949-Truman
third we will strengthen freedom loving nations against the dangers of aggression,1949-Truman
we are now working out with a number of countries a joint agreement designed to strengthen the security of the north atlantic area,1949-Truman
such an agreement would take the form of a collective defense arrangement within the terms of the united nations charter,1949-Truman
we have already established such a defense pact for the western hemisphere by the treaty of rio de janeiro,1949-Truman
the primary purpose of these agreements is to provide unmistakable proof of the joint determination of the free countries to resist armed attack from any quarter,1949-Truman
each country participating in these arrangements must contribute all it can to the common defense,1949-Truman
if we can make it sufficiently clear in advance that any armed attack affecting our national security would be met with overwhelming force the armed attack might never occur,1949-Truman
i hope soon to send to the senate a treaty respecting the north atlantic security plan,1949-Truman
in addition we will provide military advice and equipment to free nations which will cooperate with us in the maintenance of peace and security,1949-Truman
fourth we must embark on a bold new program for making the benefits of our scientific advances and industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped areas,1949-Truman
more than half the people of the world are living in conditions approaching misery,1949-Truman
their food is inadequate,1949-Truman
they are victims of disease,1949-Truman
their economic life is primitive and stagnant,1949-Truman
their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas,1949-Truman
for the first time in history humanity possesses the knowledge and the skill to relieve the suffering of these people,1949-Truman
the united states is pre eminent among nations in the development of industrial and scientific techniques,1949-Truman
the material resources which we can afford to use for the assistance of other peoples are limited,1949-Truman
but our imponderable resources in technical knowledge are constantly growing and are inexhaustible,1949-Truman
i believe that we should make available to peace loving peoples the benefits of our store of technical knowledge in order to help them realize their aspirations for a better life,1949-Truman
and in cooperation with other nations we should foster capital investment in areas needing development,1949-Truman
our aim should be to help the free peoples of the world through their own efforts to produce more food more clothing more materials for housing and more mechanical power to lighten their burdens,1949-Truman
we invite other countries to pool their technological resources in this undertaking,1949-Truman
their contributions will be warmly welcomed,1949-Truman
this should be a cooperative enterprise in which all nations work together through the united nations and its specialized agencies wherever practicable,1949-Truman
it must be a worldwide effort for the achievement of peace plenty and freedom,1949-Truman
with the cooperation of business private capital agriculture and labor in this country this program can greatly increase the industrial activity in other nations and can raise substantially their standards of living,1949-Truman
such new economic developments must be devised and controlled to benefit the peoples of the areas in which they are established,1949-Truman
guarantees to the investor must be balanced by guarantees in the interest of the people whose resources and whose labor go into these developments,1949-Truman
the old imperialism exploitation for foreign profit has no place in our plans,1949-Truman
what we envisage is a program of development based on the concepts of democratic fair dealing,1949-Truman
all countries including our own will greatly benefit from a constructive program for the better use of the world s human and natural resources,1949-Truman
experience shows that our commerce with other countries expands as they progress industrially and economically,1949-Truman
greater production is the key to prosperity and peace,1949-Truman
and the key to greater production is a wider and more vigorous application of modern scientific and technical knowledge,1949-Truman
only by helping the least fortunate of its members to help themselves can the human family achieve the decent satisfying life that is the right of all people,1949-Truman
democracy alone can supply the vitalizing force to stir the peoples of the world into triumphant action not only against their human oppressors but also against their ancient enemies hunger misery and despair,1949-Truman
on the basis of these four major courses of action we hope to help create the conditions that will lead eventually to personal freedom and happiness for all mankind,1949-Truman
if we are to be successful in carrying out these policies it is clear that we must have continued prosperity in this country and we must keep ourselves strong,1949-Truman
slowly but surely we are weaving a world fabric of international security and growing prosperity,1949-Truman
we are aided by all who wish to live in freedom from fear even by those who live today in fear under their own governments,1949-Truman
we are aided by all who want relief from the lies of propaganda who desire truth and sincerity,1949-Truman
we are aided by all who desire self government and a voice in deciding their own affairs,1949-Truman
we are aided by all who long for economic security for the security and abundance that men in free societies can enjoy,1949-Truman
we are aided by all who desire freedom of speech freedom of religion and freedom to live their own lives for useful ends,1949-Truman
our allies are the millions who hunger and thirst after righteousness,1949-Truman
in due time as our stability becomes manifest as more and more nations come to know the benefits of democracy and to participate in growing abundance i believe that those countries which now oppose us will abandon their delusions and join with the free nations of the world in a just settlement of international differences,1949-Truman
events have brought our american democracy to new influence and new responsibilities,1949-Truman
they will test our courage our devotion to duty and our concept of liberty,1949-Truman
but i say to all men what we have achieved in liberty we will surpass in greater liberty,1949-Truman
steadfast in our faith in the almighty we will advance toward a world where man s freedom is secure,1949-Truman
to that end we will devote our strength our resources and our firmness of resolve,1949-Truman
with god s help the future of mankind will be assured in a world of justice harmony and peace,1949-Truman
my friends before i begin the expression of those thoughts that i deem appropriate to this moment would you permit me the privilege of uttering a little private prayer of my own,1953-Eisenhower
and i ask that you bow your heads,1953-Eisenhower
almighty god as we stand here at this moment my future associates in the executive branch of government join me in beseeching that thou will make full and complete our dedication to the service of the people in this throng and their fellow citizens everywhere,1953-Eisenhower
give us we pray the power to discern clearly right from wrong and allow all our words and actions to be governed thereby and by the laws of this land,1953-Eisenhower
especially we pray that our concern shall be for all the people regardless of station race or calling,1953-Eisenhower
may cooperation be permitted and be the mutual aim of those who under the concepts of our constitution hold to differing political faiths so that all may work for the good of our beloved country and thy glory,1953-Eisenhower
amen,1953-Eisenhower
my fellow citizens,1953-Eisenhower
the world and we have passed the midway point of a century of continuing challenge,1953-Eisenhower
we sense with all our faculties that forces of good and evil are massed and armed and opposed as rarely before in history,1953-Eisenhower
this fact defines the meaning of this day,1953-Eisenhower
we are summoned by this honored and historic ceremony to witness more than the act of one citizen swearing his oath of service in the presence of god,1953-Eisenhower
we are called as a people to give testimony in the sight of the world to our faith that the future shall belong to the free,1953-Eisenhower
since this century s beginning a time of tempest has seemed to come upon the continents of the earth,1953-Eisenhower
masses of asia have awakened to strike off shackles of the past,1953-Eisenhower
great nations of europe have fought their bloodiest wars,1953-Eisenhower
thrones have toppled and their vast empires have disappeared,1953-Eisenhower
new nations have been born,1953-Eisenhower
for our own country it has been a time of recurring trial,1953-Eisenhower
we have grown in power and in responsibility,1953-Eisenhower
we have passed through the anxieties of depression and of war to a summit unmatched in man s history,1953-Eisenhower
seeking to secure peace in the world we have had to fight through the forests of the argonne to the shores of iwo jima and to the cold mountains of korea,1953-Eisenhower
in the swift rush of great events we find ourselves groping to know the full sense and meaning of these times in which we live,1953-Eisenhower
in our quest of understanding we beseech god s guidance,1953-Eisenhower
we summon all our knowledge of the past and we scan all signs of the future,1953-Eisenhower
we bring all our wit and all our will to meet the question,1953-Eisenhower
how far have we come in man s long pilgrimage from darkness toward light,1953-Eisenhower
are we nearing the light a day of freedom and of peace for all mankind,1953-Eisenhower
or are the shadows of another night closing in upon us,1953-Eisenhower
great as are the preoccupations absorbing us at home concerned as we are with matters that deeply affect our livelihood today and our vision of the future each of these domestic problems is dwarfed by and often even created by this question that involves all humankind,1953-Eisenhower
this trial comes at a moment when man s power to achieve good or to inflict evil surpasses the brightest hopes and the sharpest fears of all ages,1953-Eisenhower
we can turn rivers in their courses level mountains to the plains,1953-Eisenhower
oceans and land and sky are avenues for our colossal commerce,1953-Eisenhower
disease diminishes and life lengthens,1953-Eisenhower
yet the promise of this life is imperiled by the very genius that has made it possible,1953-Eisenhower
nations amass wealth,1953-Eisenhower
labor sweats to create and turns out devices to level not only mountains but also cities,1953-Eisenhower
science seems ready to confer upon us as its final gift the power to erase human life from this planet,1953-Eisenhower
at such a time in history we who are free must proclaim anew our faith,1953-Eisenhower
this faith is the abiding creed of our fathers,1953-Eisenhower
it is our faith in the deathless dignity of man governed by eternal moral and natural laws,1953-Eisenhower
this faith defines our full view of life,1953-Eisenhower
it establishes beyond debate those gifts of the creator that are man s inalienable rights and that make all men equal in his sight,1953-Eisenhower
in the light of this equality we know that the virtues most cherished by free people love of truth pride of work devotion to country all are treasures equally precious in the lives of the most humble and of the most exalted,1953-Eisenhower
the men who mine coal and fire furnaces and balance ledgers and turn lathes and pick cotton and heal the sick and plant corn all serve as proudly and as profitably for america as the statesmen who draft treaties and the legislators who enact laws,1953-Eisenhower
this faith rules our whole way of life,1953-Eisenhower
it decrees that we the people elect leaders not to rule but to serve,1953-Eisenhower
it asserts that we have the right to choice of our own work and to the reward of our own toil,1953-Eisenhower
it inspires the initiative that makes our productivity the wonder of the world,1953-Eisenhower
and it warns that any man who seeks to deny equality among all his brothers betrays the spirit of the free and invites the mockery of the tyrant,1953-Eisenhower
it is because we all of us hold to these principles that the political changes accomplished this day do not imply turbulence upheaval or disorder,1953-Eisenhower
rather this change expresses a purpose of strengthening our dedication and devotion to the precepts of our founding documents a conscious renewal of faith in our country and in the watchfulness of a divine providence,1953-Eisenhower
the enemies of this faith know no god but force no devotion but its use,1953-Eisenhower
they tutor men in treason,1953-Eisenhower
they feed upon the hunger of others,1953-Eisenhower
whatever defies them they torture especially the truth,1953-Eisenhower
here then is joined no argument between slightly differing philosophies,1953-Eisenhower
this conflict strikes directly at the faith of our fathers and the lives of our sons,1953-Eisenhower
no principle or treasure that we hold from the spiritual knowledge of our free schools and churches to the creative magic of free labor and capital nothing lies safely beyond the reach of this struggle,1953-Eisenhower
freedom is pitted against slavery lightness against the dark,1953-Eisenhower
the faith we hold belongs not to us alone but to the free of all the world,1953-Eisenhower
this common bond binds the grower of rice in burma and the planter of wheat in iowa the shepherd in southern italy and the mountaineer in the andes,1953-Eisenhower
it confers a common dignity upon the french soldier who dies in indo china the british soldier killed in malaya the american life given in korea,1953-Eisenhower
we know beyond this that we are linked to all free peoples not merely by a noble idea but by a simple need,1953-Eisenhower
no free people can for long cling to any privilege or enjoy any safety in economic solitude,1953-Eisenhower
for all our own material might even we need markets in the world for the surpluses of our farms and our factories,1953-Eisenhower
equally we need for these same farms and factories vital materials and products of distant lands,1953-Eisenhower
this basic law of interdependence so manifest in the commerce of peace applies with thousand fold intensity in the event of war,1953-Eisenhower
so we are persuaded by necessity and by belief that the strength of all free peoples lies in unity their danger in discord,1953-Eisenhower
to produce this unity to meet the challenge of our time destiny has laid upon our country the responsibility of the free world s leadership,1953-Eisenhower
so it is proper that we assure our friends once again that in the discharge of this responsibility we americans know and we observe the difference between world leadership and imperialism between firmness and truculence between a thoughtfully calculated goal and spasmodic reaction to the stimulus of emergencies,1953-Eisenhower
we wish our friends the world over to know this above all we face the threat not with dread and confusion but with confidence and conviction,1953-Eisenhower
we feel this moral strength because we know that we are not helpless prisoners of history,1953-Eisenhower
we are free men,1953-Eisenhower
we shall remain free never to be proven guilty of the one capital offense against freedom a lack of stanch faith,1953-Eisenhower
in pleading our just cause before the bar of history and in pressing our labor for world peace we shall be guided by certain fixed principles,1953-Eisenhower
these principles are,1953-Eisenhower
1 abhorring war as a chosen way to balk the purposes of those who threaten us we hold it to be the first task of statesmanship to develop the strength that will deter the forces of aggression and promote the conditions of peace,1953-Eisenhower
for as it must be the supreme purpose of all free men so it must be the dedication of their leaders to save humanity from preying upon itself,1953-Eisenhower
in the light of this principle we stand ready to engage with any and all others in joint effort to remove the causes of mutual fear and distrust among nations so as to make possible drastic reduction of armaments,1953-Eisenhower
the sole requisites for undertaking such effort are that in their purpose they be aimed logically and honestly toward secure peace for all and that in their result they provide methods by which every participating nation will prove good faith in carrying out its pledge,1953-Eisenhower
2 realizing that common sense and common decency alike dictate the futility of appeasement we shall never try to placate an aggressor by the false and wicked bargain of trading honor for security,1953-Eisenhower
americans indeed all free men remember that in the final choice a soldier s pack is not so heavy a burden as a prisoner s chains,1953-Eisenhower
3 knowing that only a united states that is strong and immensely productive can help defend freedom in our world we view our nation s strength and security as a trust upon which rests the hope of free men everywhere,1953-Eisenhower
it is the firm duty of each of our free citizens and of every free citizen everywhere to place the cause of his country before the comfort the convenience of himself,1953-Eisenhower
4 honoring the identity and the special heritage of each nation in the world we shall never use our strength to try to impress upon another people our own cherished political and economic institutions,1953-Eisenhower
5 assessing realistically the needs and capacities of proven friends of freedom we shall strive to help them to achieve their own security and well being,1953-Eisenhower
likewise we shall count upon them to assume within the limits of their resources their full and just burdens in the common defense of freedom,1953-Eisenhower
6 recognizing economic health as an indispensable basis of military strength and the free world s peace we shall strive to foster everywhere and to practice ourselves policies that encourage productivity and profitable trade,1953-Eisenhower
for the impoverishment of any single people in the world means danger to the well being of all other peoples,1953-Eisenhower
7 appreciating that economic need military security and political wisdom combine to suggest regional groupings of free peoples we hope within the framework of the united nations to help strengthen such special bonds the world over,1953-Eisenhower
the nature of these ties must vary with the different problems of different areas,1953-Eisenhower
in the western hemisphere we enthusiastically join with all our neighbors in the work of perfecting a community of fraternal trust and common purpose,1953-Eisenhower
in europe we ask that enlightened and inspired leaders of the western nations strive with renewed vigor to make the unity of their peoples a reality,1953-Eisenhower
only as free europe unitedly marshals its strength can it effectively safeguard even with our help its spiritual and cultural heritage,1953-Eisenhower
8 conceiving the defense of freedom like freedom itself to be one and indivisible we hold all continents and peoples in equal regard and honor,1953-Eisenhower
we reject any insinuation that one race or another one people or another is in any sense inferior or expendable,1953-Eisenhower
9 respecting the united nations as the living sign of all people s hope for peace we shall strive to make it not merely an eloquent symbol but an effective force,1953-Eisenhower
and in our quest for an honorable peace we shall neither compromise nor tire nor ever cease,1953-Eisenhower
by these rules of conduct we hope to be known to all peoples,1953-Eisenhower
by their observance an earth of peace may become not a vision but a fact,1953-Eisenhower
this hope this supreme aspiration must rule the way we live,1953-Eisenhower
we must be ready to dare all for our country,1953-Eisenhower
for history does not long entrust the care of freedom to the weak or the timid,1953-Eisenhower
we must acquire proficiency in defense and display stamina in purpose,1953-Eisenhower
we must be willing individually and as a nation to accept whatever sacrifices may be required of us,1953-Eisenhower
a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both,1953-Eisenhower
these basic precepts are not lofty abstractions far removed from matters of daily living,1953-Eisenhower
they are laws of spiritual strength that generate and define our material strength,1953-Eisenhower
patriotism means equipped forces and a prepared citizenry,1953-Eisenhower
moral stamina means more energy and more productivity on the farm and in the factory,1953-Eisenhower
love of liberty means the guarding of every resource that makes freedom possible from the sanctity of our families and the wealth of our soil to the genius of our scientists,1953-Eisenhower
and so each citizen plays an indispensable role,1953-Eisenhower
the productivity of our heads our hands and our hearts is the source of all the strength we can command for both the enrichment of our lives and the winning of the peace,1953-Eisenhower
no person no home no community can be beyond the reach of this call,1953-Eisenhower
we are summoned to act in wisdom and in conscience to work with industry to teach with persuasion to preach with conviction to weigh our every deed with care and with compassion,1953-Eisenhower
for this truth must be clear before us whatever america hopes to bring to pass in the world must first come to pass in the heart of america,1953-Eisenhower
the peace we seek then is nothing less than the practice and fulfillment of our whole faith among ourselves and in our dealings with others,1953-Eisenhower
this signifies more than the stilling of guns easing the sorrow of war,1953-Eisenhower
more than escape from death it is a way of life,1953-Eisenhower
more than a haven for the weary it is a hope for the brave,1953-Eisenhower
this is the hope that beckons us onward in this century of trial,1953-Eisenhower
this is the work that awaits us all to be done with bravery with charity and with prayer to almighty god,1953-Eisenhower
the price of peace mr chairman mr vice president mr chief justice mr speaker members of my family and friends my countrymen and the friends of my country wherever they may be we meet again as upon a like moment four years ago and again you have witnessed my solemn oath of service to you,1957-Eisenhower
i too am a witness today testifying in your name to the principles and purposes to which we as a people are pledged,1957-Eisenhower
before all else we seek upon our common labor as a nation the blessings of almighty god,1957-Eisenhower
and the hopes in our hearts fashion the deepest prayers of our whole people,1957-Eisenhower
may we pursue the right without self righteousness,1957-Eisenhower
may we know unity without conformity,1957-Eisenhower
may we grow in strength without pride in self,1957-Eisenhower
may we in our dealings with all peoples of the earth ever speak truth and serve justice,1957-Eisenhower
and so shall america in the sight of all men of good will prove true to the honorable purposes that bind and rule us as a people in all this time of trial through which we pass,1957-Eisenhower
we live in a land of plenty but rarely has this earth known such peril as today,1957-Eisenhower
in our nation work and wealth abound,1957-Eisenhower
our population grows,1957-Eisenhower
commerce crowds our rivers and rails our skies harbors and highways,1957-Eisenhower
our soil is fertile our agriculture productive,1957-Eisenhower
the air rings with the song of our industry rolling mills and blast furnaces dynamos dams and assembly lines the chorus of america the bountiful,1957-Eisenhower
this is our home yet this is not the whole of our world,1957-Eisenhower
for our world is where our full destiny lies with men of all people and all nations who are or would be free,1957-Eisenhower
and for them and so for us this is no time of ease or of rest,1957-Eisenhower
in too much of the earth there is want discord danger,1957-Eisenhower
new forces and new nations stir and strive across the earth with power to bring by their fate great good or great evil to the free world s future,1957-Eisenhower
from the deserts of north africa to the islands of the south pacific one third of all mankind has entered upon an historic struggle for a new freedom freedom from grinding poverty,1957-Eisenhower
across all continents nearly a billion people seek sometimes almost in desperation for the skills and knowledge and assistance by which they may satisfy from their own resources the material wants common to all mankind,1957-Eisenhower
no nation however old or great escapes this tempest of change and turmoil,1957-Eisenhower
some impoverished by the recent world war seek to restore their means of livelihood,1957-Eisenhower
in the heart of europe germany still stands tragically divided,1957-Eisenhower
so is the whole continent divided,1957-Eisenhower
and so too is all the world,1957-Eisenhower
the divisive force is international communism and the power that it controls,1957-Eisenhower
the designs of that power dark in purpose are clear in practice,1957-Eisenhower
it strives to seal forever the fate of those it has enslaved,1957-Eisenhower
it strives to break the ties that unite the free,1957-Eisenhower
and it strives to capture to exploit for its own greater power all forces of change in the world especially the needs of the hungry and the hopes of the oppressed,1957-Eisenhower
yet the world of international communism has itself been shaken by a fierce and mighty force the readiness of men who love freedom to pledge their lives to that love,1957-Eisenhower
through the night of their bondage the unconquerable will of heroes has struck with the swift sharp thrust of lightning,1957-Eisenhower
budapest is no longer merely the name of a city henceforth it is a new and shining symbol of man s yearning to be free,1957-Eisenhower
thus across all the globe there harshly blow the winds of change,1957-Eisenhower
and we though fortunate be our lot know that we can never turn our backs to them,1957-Eisenhower
we look upon this shaken earth and we declare our firm and fixed purpose the building of a peace with justice in a world where moral law prevails,1957-Eisenhower
the building of such a peace is a bold and solemn purpose,1957-Eisenhower
to proclaim it is easy,1957-Eisenhower
to serve it will be hard,1957-Eisenhower
and to attain it we must be aware of its full meaning and ready to pay its full price,1957-Eisenhower
we know clearly what we seek and why,1957-Eisenhower
we seek peace knowing that peace is the climate of freedom,1957-Eisenhower
and now as in no other age we seek it because we have been warned by the power of modern weapons that peace may be the only climate possible for human life itself,1957-Eisenhower
yet this peace we seek cannot be born of fear alone it must be rooted in the lives of nations,1957-Eisenhower
there must be justice sensed and shared by all peoples for without justice the world can know only a tense and unstable truce,1957-Eisenhower
there must be law steadily invoked and respected by all nations for without law the world promises only such meager justice as the pity of the strong upon the weak,1957-Eisenhower
but the law of which we speak comprehending the values of freedom affirms the equality of all nations great and small,1957-Eisenhower
splendid as can be the blessings of such a peace high will be its cost in toil patiently sustained in help honorably given in sacrifice calmly borne,1957-Eisenhower
we are called to meet the price of this peace,1957-Eisenhower
to counter the threat of those who seek to rule by force we must pay the costs of our own needed military strength and help to build the security of others,1957-Eisenhower
we must use our skills and knowledge and at times our substance to help others rise from misery however far the scene of suffering may be from our shores,1957-Eisenhower
for wherever in the world a people knows desperate want there must appear at least the spark of hope the hope of progress or there will surely rise at last the flames of conflict,1957-Eisenhower
we recognize and accept our own deep involvement in the destiny of men everywhere,1957-Eisenhower
we are accordingly pledged to honor and to strive to fortify the authority of the united nations,1957-Eisenhower
for in that body rests the best hope of our age for the assertion of that law by which all nations may live in dignity,1957-Eisenhower
and beyond this general resolve we are called to act a responsible role in the world s great concerns or conflicts whether they touch upon the affairs of a vast region the fate of an island in the pacific or the use of a canal in the middle east,1957-Eisenhower
only in respecting the hopes and cultures of others will we practice the equality of all nations,1957-Eisenhower
only as we show willingness and wisdom in giving counsel in receiving counsel and in sharing burdens will we wisely perform the work of peace,1957-Eisenhower
for one truth must rule all we think and all we do,1957-Eisenhower
no people can live to itself alone,1957-Eisenhower
the unity of all who dwell in freedom is their only sure defense,1957-Eisenhower
the economic need of all nations in mutual dependence makes isolation an impossibility not even america s prosperity could long survive if other nations did not also prosper,1957-Eisenhower
no nation can longer be a fortress lone and strong and safe,1957-Eisenhower
and any people seeking such shelter for themselves can now build only their own prison,1957-Eisenhower
our pledge to these principles is constant because we believe in their rightness,1957-Eisenhower
we do not fear this world of change,1957-Eisenhower
america is no stranger to much of its spirit,1957-Eisenhower
everywhere we see the seeds of the same growth that america itself has known,1957-Eisenhower
the american experiment has for generations fired the passion and the courage of millions elsewhere seeking freedom equality and opportunity,1957-Eisenhower
and the american story of material progress has helped excite the longing of all needy peoples for some satisfaction of their human wants,1957-Eisenhower
these hopes that we have helped to inspire we can help to fulfill,1957-Eisenhower
in this confidence we speak plainly to all peoples,1957-Eisenhower
we cherish our friendship with all nations that are or would be free,1957-Eisenhower
we respect no less their independence,1957-Eisenhower
and when in time of want or peril they ask our help they may honorably receive it for we no more seek to buy their sovereignty than we would sell our own,1957-Eisenhower
sovereignty is never bartered among freemen,1957-Eisenhower
we honor the aspirations of those nations which now captive long for freedom,1957-Eisenhower
we seek neither their military alliance nor any artificial imitation of our society,1957-Eisenhower
and they can know the warmth of the welcome that awaits them when as must be they join again the ranks of freedom,1957-Eisenhower
we honor no less in this divided world than in a less tormented time the people of russia,1957-Eisenhower
we do not dread rather do we welcome their progress in education and industry,1957-Eisenhower
we wish them success in their demands for more intellectual freedom greater security before their own laws fuller enjoyment of the rewards of their own toil,1957-Eisenhower
for as such things come to pass the more certain will be the coming of that day when our peoples may freely meet in friendship,1957-Eisenhower
so we voice our hope and our belief that we can help to heal this divided world,1957-Eisenhower
thus may the nations cease to live in trembling before the menace of force,1957-Eisenhower
thus may the weight of fear and the weight of arms be taken from the burdened shoulders of mankind,1957-Eisenhower
this nothing less is the labor to which we are called and our strength dedicated,1957-Eisenhower
and so the prayer of our people carries far beyond our own frontiers to the wide world of our duty and our destiny,1957-Eisenhower
may the light of freedom coming to all darkened lands flame brightly until at last the darkness is no more,1957-Eisenhower
may the turbulence of our age yield to a true time of peace when men and nations shall share a life that honors the dignity of each the brotherhood of all,1957-Eisenhower
vice president johnson mr speaker mr chief justice president eisenhower vice president nixon president truman reverend clergy fellow citizens we observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom symbolizing an end as well as a beginning signifying renewal as well as change,1961-Kennedy
for i have sworn i before you and almighty god the same solemn oath our forebears l prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago,1961-Kennedy
the world is very different now,1961-Kennedy
for man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life,1961-Kennedy
and yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of god,1961-Kennedy
we dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution,1961-Kennedy
let the word go forth from this time and place to friend and foe alike that the torch has been passed to a new generation of americans born in this century tempered by war disciplined by a hard and bitter peace proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed and to which we are committed today at home and around the world,1961-Kennedy
let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty,1961-Kennedy
this much we pledge and more,1961-Kennedy
to those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends,1961-Kennedy
united there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures,1961-Kennedy
divided there is little we can do for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder,1961-Kennedy
to those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny,1961-Kennedy
we shall not always expect to find them supporting our view,1961-Kennedy
but we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom and to remember that in the past those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside,1961-Kennedy
to those peoples in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves for whatever period is required not because the communists may be doing it not because we seek their votes but because it is right,1961-Kennedy
if a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich,1961-Kennedy
to our sister republics south of our border we offer a special pledge to convert our good words into good deeds in a new alliance for progress to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty,1961-Kennedy
but this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers,1961-Kennedy
let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the americas,1961-Kennedy
and let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house,1961-Kennedy
to that world assembly of sovereign states the united nations our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace we renew our pledge of support to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run,1961-Kennedy
finally to those nations who would make themselves our adversary we offer not a pledge but a request that both sides begin anew the quest for peace before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self destruction,1961-Kennedy
we dare not tempt them with weakness,1961-Kennedy
for only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed,1961-Kennedy
but neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind s final war,1961-Kennedy
so let us begin anew remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness and sincerity is always subject to proof,1961-Kennedy
let us never negotiate out of fear,1961-Kennedy
but let us never fear to negotiate,1961-Kennedy
let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us,1961-Kennedy
let both sides for the first time formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations,1961-Kennedy
let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors,1961-Kennedy
together let us explore the stars conquer the deserts eradicate disease tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce,1961-Kennedy
let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of isaiah to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free,1961-Kennedy
and if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion let both sides join in creating a new endeavor not a new balance of power but a new world of law where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved,1961-Kennedy
all this will not be finished in the first 100 days,1961-Kennedy
nor will it be finished in the first 1 000 days nor in the life of this administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet,1961-Kennedy
but let us begin,1961-Kennedy
in your hands my fellow citizens more than in mine will rest the final success or failure of our course,1961-Kennedy
since this country was founded each generation of americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty,1961-Kennedy
the graves of young americans who answered the call to service surround the globe,1961-Kennedy
now the trumpet summons us again not as a call to bear arms though arms we need not as a call to battle though embattled we are but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle year in and year out rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation a struggle against the common enemies of man tyranny poverty disease and war itself,1961-Kennedy
can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance north and south east and west that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind,1961-Kennedy
will you join in that historic effort,1961-Kennedy
in the long history of the world only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger,1961-Kennedy
i do not shrink from this responsibility i welcome it,1961-Kennedy
i do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation,1961-Kennedy
the energy the faith the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it and the glow from that fire can truly light the world,1961-Kennedy
and so my fellow americans ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country,1961-Kennedy
my fellow citizens of the world ask not what america will do for you but what together we can do for the freedom of man,1961-Kennedy
finally whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world ask of us the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you,1961-Kennedy
with a good conscience our only sure reward with history the final judge of our deeds let us go forth to lead the land we love asking his blessing and his help but knowing that here on earth god s work must truly be our own,1961-Kennedy
my fellow countrymen on this occasion the oath i have taken before you and before god is not mine alone but ours together,1965-Johnson
we are one nation and one people,1965-Johnson
our fate as a nation and our future as a people rest not upon one citizen but upon all citizens,1965-Johnson
this is the majesty and the meaning of this moment,1965-Johnson
for every generation there is a destiny,1965-Johnson
for some history decides,1965-Johnson
for this generation the choice must be our own,1965-Johnson
even now a rocket moves toward mars,1965-Johnson
it reminds us that the world will not be the same for our children or even for ourselves m a short span of years,1965-Johnson
the next man to stand here will look out on a scene different from our own because ours is a time of change rapid and fantastic change bearing the secrets of nature multiplying the nations placing in uncertain hands new weapons for mastery and destruction shaking old values and uprooting old ways,1965-Johnson
our destiny in the midst of change will rest on the unchanged character of our people and on their faith,1965-Johnson
the american covenant they came here the exile and the stranger brave but frightened to find a place where a man could be his own man,1965-Johnson
they made a covenant with this land,1965-Johnson
conceived in justice written in liberty bound in union it was meant one day to inspire the hopes of all mankind and it binds us still,1965-Johnson
if we keep its terms we shall flourish,1965-Johnson
justice and change first justice was the promise that all who made the journey would share in the fruits of the land,1965-Johnson
in a land of great wealth families must not live in hopeless poverty,1965-Johnson
in a land rich in harvest children just must not go hungry,1965-Johnson
in a land of healing miracles neighbors must not suffer and die unattended,1965-Johnson
in a great land of learning and scholars young people must be taught to read and write,1965-Johnson
for the more than 30 years that i have served this nation i have believed that this injustice to our people this waste of our resources was our real enemy,1965-Johnson
for 30 years or more with the resources i have had i have vigilantly fought against it,1965-Johnson
i have learned and i know that it will not surrender easily,1965-Johnson
but change has given us new weapons,1965-Johnson
before this generation of americans is finished this enemy will not only retreat it will be conquered,1965-Johnson
justice requires us to remember that when any citizen denies his fellow saying his color is not mine or his beliefs are strange and different in that moment he betrays america though his forebears created this nation,1965-Johnson
liberty and change liberty was the second article of our covenant,1965-Johnson
it was self government,1965-Johnson
it was our bill of rights,1965-Johnson
but it was more,1965-Johnson
america would be a place where each man could be proud to be himself stretching his talents rejoicing in his work important in the life of his neighbors and his nation,1965-Johnson
this has become more difficult in a world where change and growth seem to tower beyond the control and even the judgment of men,1965-Johnson
we must work to provide the knowledge and the surroundings which can enlarge the possibilities of every citizen,1965-Johnson
the american covenant called on us to help show the way for the liberation of man,1965-Johnson
and that is today our goal,1965-Johnson
thus if as a nation there is much outside our control as a people no stranger is outside our hope,1965-Johnson
change has brought new meaning to that old mission,1965-Johnson
we can never again stand aside prideful in isolation,1965-Johnson
terrific dangers and troubles that we once called foreign now constantly live among us,1965-Johnson
if american lives must end and american treasure be spilled in countries we barely know that is the price that change has demanded of conviction and of our enduring covenant,1965-Johnson
think of our world as it looks from the rocket that is heading toward mars,1965-Johnson
it is like a child s globe hanging in space the continents stuck to its side like colored maps,1965-Johnson
we are all fellow passengers on a dot of earth,1965-Johnson
and each of us in the span of time has really only a moment among our companions,1965-Johnson
how incredible it is that in this fragile existence we should hate and destroy one another,1965-Johnson
there are possibilities enough for all who will abandon mastery over others to pursue mastery over nature,1965-Johnson
there is world enough for all to seek their happiness in their own way,1965-Johnson
our nation s course is abundantly clear,1965-Johnson
we aspire to nothing that belongs to others,1965-Johnson
we seek no dominion over our fellow man,1965-Johnson
but man s dominion over tyranny and misery,1965-Johnson
but more is required,1965-Johnson
men want to be a part of a common enterprise a cause greater than themselves,1965-Johnson
each of us must find a way to advance the purpose of the nation thus finding new purpose for ourselves,1965-Johnson
without this we shall become a nation of strangers,1965-Johnson
change and the union the third article was union,1965-Johnson
to those who were small and few against the wilderness the success of liberty demanded the strength of union,1965-Johnson
two centuries of change have made this true again,1965-Johnson
no longer need capitalist and worker farmer and clerk city and countryside struggle to divide our bounty,1965-Johnson
by working shoulder to shoulder together we can increase the bounty of all,1965-Johnson
we have discovered that every child who learns every man who finds work every sick body together like a candle added to an altar brightens the hope of all the faithful,1965-Johnson
so let us reject any among us who seek to reopen old wounds and to rekindle old hatreds,1965-Johnson
they stand in the way of a seeking nation,1965-Johnson
let us now join reason to faith and action to experience to transform our unity of interest into a unity of purpose,1965-Johnson
for the hour and the day and the time are here to achieve progress without strife to achieve change without hatred not without difference of opinion but without the deep and abiding divisions which scar the union for generations,1965-Johnson
the american belief under this covenant of justice liberty and union we have become a nation prosperous great and mighty,1965-Johnson
and we have kept our freedom,1965-Johnson
but we have no promise from god that our greatness will endure,1965-Johnson
we have been allowed by him to seek greatness with the sweat of our hands and the strength of our spirit,1965-Johnson
i do not believe that the great society is the ordered changeless and sterile battalion of the ants,1965-Johnson
it is the excitement of becoming always becoming trying probing falling resting and trying again but always trying and always gaining,1965-Johnson
in each generation with toil and tears we have had to earn our heritage again,1965-Johnson
if we fail now we shall have forgotten in abundance what we learned in hardship that democracy rests on faith that freedom asks more than it gives and that the judgment of god is harshest on those who are most favored,1965-Johnson
if we succeed it will not be because of what we have but it will be because of what we are not because of what we own but rather because of what we believe,1965-Johnson
for we are a nation of believers,1965-Johnson
underneath the clamor of building and the rush of our day s pursuits we are believers in justice and liberty and union and in our own union,1965-Johnson
we believe that every man must someday be free,1965-Johnson
and we believe in ourselves,1965-Johnson
our enemies have always made the same mistake,1965-Johnson
in my lifetime in depression and in war they have awaited our defeat,1965-Johnson
each time from the secret places of the american heart came forth the faith they could not see or that they could not even imagine,1965-Johnson
it brought us victory,1965-Johnson
and it will again,1965-Johnson
for this is what america is all about,1965-Johnson
it is the uncrossed desert and the unclimbed ridge,1965-Johnson
it is the star that is not reached and the harvest sleeping in the unplowed ground,1965-Johnson
is our world gone,1965-Johnson
we say farewell,1965-Johnson
is a new world coming,1965-Johnson
we welcome it and we will bend it to the hopes of man,1965-Johnson
to these trusted public servants and to my family and those close friends of mine who have followed me down a long winding road and to all the people of this union and the world i will repeat today what i said on that sorrowful day in november 1963 i will lead and i will do the best i can,1965-Johnson
but you must look within your own hearts to the old promises and to the old dream,1965-Johnson
they will lead you best of all,1965-Johnson
for myself i ask only in the words of an ancient leader give me now wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come in before this people for who can judge this thy people that is so great,1965-Johnson
senator dirksen mr chief justice mr vice president president johnson vice president humphrey my fellow americans and my fellow citizens of the world community,1969-Nixon
i ask you to share with me today the majesty of this moment,1969-Nixon
in the orderly transfer of power we celebrate the unity that keeps us free,1969-Nixon
each moment in history is a fleeting time precious and unique,1969-Nixon
but some stand out as moments of beginning in which courses are set that shape decades or centuries,1969-Nixon
this can be such a moment,1969-Nixon
forces now are converging that make possible for the first time the hope that many of man s deepest aspirations can at last be realized,1969-Nixon
the spiraling pace of change allows us to contemplate within our own lifetime advances that once would have taken centuries,1969-Nixon
in throwing wide the horizons of space we have discovered new horizons on earth,1969-Nixon
for the first time because the people of the world want peace and the leaders of the world are afraid of war the times are on the side of peace,1969-Nixon
eight years from now america will celebrate its 200th anniversary as a nation,1969-Nixon
within the lifetime of most people now living mankind will celebrate that great new year which comes only once in a thousand years the beginning of the third millennium,1969-Nixon
what kind of nation we will be what kind of world we will live in whether we shape the future in the image of our hopes is ours to determine by our actions and our choices,1969-Nixon
the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker,1969-Nixon
this honor now beckons america the chance to help lead the world at last out of the valley of turmoil and onto that high ground of peace that man has dreamed of since the dawn of civilization,1969-Nixon
if we succeed generations to come will say of us now living that we mastered our moment that we helped make the world safe for mankind,1969-Nixon
this is our summons to greatness,1969-Nixon
i believe the american people are ready to answer this call,1969-Nixon
the second third of this century has been a time of proud achievement,1969-Nixon
we have made enormous strides in science and industry and agriculture,1969-Nixon
we have shared our wealth more broadly than ever,1969-Nixon
we have learned at last to manage a modern economy to assure its continued growth,1969-Nixon
we have given freedom new reach and we have begun to make its promise real for black as well as for white,1969-Nixon
we see the hope of tomorrow in the youth of today,1969-Nixon
i know america s youth,1969-Nixon
i believe in them,1969-Nixon
we can be proud that they are better educated more committed more passionately driven by conscience than any generation in our history,1969-Nixon
no people has ever been so close to the achievement of a just and abundant society or so possessed of the will to achieve it,1969-Nixon
because our strengths are so great we can afford to appraise our weaknesses with candor and to approach them with hope,1969-Nixon
standing in this same place a third of a century ago franklin delano roosevelt addressed a nation ravaged by depression and gripped in fear,1969-Nixon
he could say in surveying the nation s troubles they concern thank god only material things,1969-Nixon
our crisis today is the reverse,1969-Nixon
we have found ourselves rich in goods but ragged in spirit reaching with magnificent precision for the moon but falling into raucous discord on earth,1969-Nixon
we are caught in war wanting peace,1969-Nixon
we are torn by division wanting unity,1969-Nixon
we see around us empty lives wanting fulfillment,1969-Nixon
we see tasks that need doing waiting for hands to do them,1969-Nixon
to a crisis of the spirit we need an answer of the spirit,1969-Nixon
to find that answer we need only look within ourselves,1969-Nixon
when we listen to the better angels of our nature we find that they celebrate the simple things the basic things such as goodness decency love kindness,1969-Nixon
greatness comes in simple trappings,1969-Nixon
the simple things are the ones most needed today if we are to surmount what divides us and cement what unites us,1969-Nixon
to lower our voices would be a simple thing,1969-Nixon
in these difficult years america has suffered from a fever of words from inflated rhetoric that promises more than it can deliver from angry rhetoric that fans discontents into hatreds from bombastic rhetoric that postures instead of persuading,1969-Nixon
we cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices,1969-Nixon
for its part government will listen,1969-Nixon
we will strive to listen in new ways to the voices of quiet anguish the voices that speak without words the voices of the heart to the injured voices the anxious voices the voices that have despaired of being heard,1969-Nixon
those who have been left out we will try to bring in,1969-Nixon
those left behind we will help to catch up,1969-Nixon
for all of our people we will set as our goal the decent order that makes progress possible and our lives secure,1969-Nixon
as we reach toward our hopes our task is to build on what has gone before not turning away from the old but turning toward the new,1969-Nixon
in this past third of a century government has passed more laws spent more money initiated more programs than in all our previous history,1969-Nixon
in pursuing our goals of full employment better housing excellence in education in rebuilding our cities and improving our rural areas in protecting our environment and enhancing the quality of life in all these and more we will and must pres urgently forward,1969-Nixon
we shall plan now for the day when our wealth can be transferred from the destruction of war abroad to the urgent needs of our people at home,1969-Nixon
the american dream does not come to those who fall asleep,1969-Nixon
but we are approaching the limits of what government alone can do,1969-Nixon
our greatest need now is to reach beyond government and to enlist the legions of the concerned and the committed,1969-Nixon
what has to be done has to be done by government and people together or it will not be done at all,1969-Nixon
the lesson of past agony is that without the people we can do nothing with the people we can do everything,1969-Nixon
to match the magnitude of our tasks we need the energies of our people enlisted not only in grand enterprises but more importantly in those small splendid efforts that make headlines in the neighborhood newspaper instead of the national journal,1969-Nixon
with these we can build a great cathedral of the spirit each of us raising it one stone at a time as he reaches out to his neighbor helping caring doing,1969-Nixon
i do not offer a life of uninspiring ease,1969-Nixon
i do not call for a life of grim sacrifice,1969-Nixon
i ask you to join in a high adventure one as rich as humanity itself and as exciting as the times we live in,1969-Nixon
the essence of freedom is that each of us shares in the shaping of his own destiny,1969-Nixon
until he has been part of a cause larger than himself no man is truly whole,1969-Nixon
the way to fulfillment is in the use of our talents we achieve nobility in the spirit that inspires that use,1969-Nixon
as we measure what can be done we shall promise only what we know we can produce but as we chart our goals we shall be lifted by our dreams,1969-Nixon
no man can be fully free while his neighbor is not,1969-Nixon
to go forward at all is to go forward together,1969-Nixon
this means black and white together as one nation not two,1969-Nixon
the laws have caught up with our conscience,1969-Nixon
what remains is to give life to what is in the law to ensure at last that as all are born equal in dignity before god all are born equal in dignity before man,1969-Nixon
as we learn to go forward together at home let us also seek to go forward together with all mankind,1969-Nixon
let us take as our goal where peace is unknown make it welcome where peace is fragile make it strong where peace is temporary make it permanent,1969-Nixon
after a period of confrontation we are entering an era of negotiation,1969-Nixon
let all nations know that during this administration our lines of communication will be open,1969-Nixon
we seek an open world open to ideas open to the exchange of goods and people a world in which no people great or small will live in angry isolation,1969-Nixon
we cannot expect to make everyone our friend but we can try to make no one our enemy,1969-Nixon
those who would be our adversaries we invite to a peaceful competition not in conquering territory or extending dominion but in enriching the life of man,1969-Nixon
as we explore the reaches of space let us go to the new worlds together not as new worlds to be conquered but as a new adventure to be shared,1969-Nixon
with those who are willing to join let us cooperate to reduce the burden of arms to strengthen the structure of peace to lift up the poor and the hungry,1969-Nixon
but to all those who would be tempted by weakness let us leave no doubt that we will be as strong as we need to be for as long as we need to be,1969-Nixon
over the past twenty years since i first came to this capital as a freshman congressman i have visited most of the nations of the world,1969-Nixon
i have come to know the leaders of the world and the great forces the hatreds the fears that divide the world,1969-Nixon
i know that peace does not come through wishing for it that there is no substitute for days and even years of patient and prolonged diplomacy,1969-Nixon
i also know the people of the world,1969-Nixon
i have seen the hunger of a homeless child the pain of a man wounded in battle the grief of a mother who has lost her son,1969-Nixon
i know these have no ideology no race,1969-Nixon
i know america,1969-Nixon
i know the heart of america is good,1969-Nixon
i speak from my own heart and the heart of my country the deep concern we have for those who suffer and those who sorrow,1969-Nixon
i have taken an oath today in the presence of god and my countrymen to uphold and defend the constitution of the united states,1969-Nixon
to that oath i now add this sacred commitment i shall consecrate my office my energies and all the wisdom i can summon to the cause of peace among nations,1969-Nixon
let this message be heard by strong and weak alike,1969-Nixon
the peace we seek to win is not victory over any other people but the peace that comes with healing in its wings with compassion for those who have suffered with understanding for those who have opposed us with the opportunity for all the peoples of this earth to choose their own destiny,1969-Nixon
only a few short weeks ago we shared the glory of man s first sight of the world as god sees it as a single sphere reflecting light in the darkness,1969-Nixon
as the apollo astronauts flew over the moon s gray surface on christmas eve they spoke to us of the beauty of earth and in that voice so clear across the lunar distance we heard them invoke god s blessing on its goodness,1969-Nixon
in that moment their view from the moon moved poet archibald macleish to write,1969-Nixon
to see the earth as it truly is small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold brothers who know now they are truly brothers,1969-Nixon
in that moment of surpassing technological triumph men turned their thoughts toward home and humanity seeing in that far perspective that man s destiny on earth is not divisible telling us that however far we reach into the cosmos our destiny lies not in the stars but on earth itself in our own hands in our own hearts,1969-Nixon
we have endured a long night of the american spirit,1969-Nixon
but as our eyes catch the dimness of the first rays of dawn let us not curse the remaining dark,1969-Nixon
let us gather the light,1969-Nixon
our destiny offers not the cup of despair but the chalice of opportunity,1969-Nixon
so let us seize it not in fear but in gladness and riders on the earth together let us go forward firm in our faith steadfast in our purpose cautious of the dangers but sustained by our confidence in the will of god and the promise of man,1969-Nixon
mr vice president mr speaker mr chief justice senator cook mrs eisenhower and my fellow citizens of this great and good country we share together,1973-Nixon
when we met here four years ago america was bleak in spirit depressed by the prospect of seemingly endless war abroad and of destructive conflict at home,1973-Nixon
as we meet here today we stand on the threshold of a new era of peace in the world,1973-Nixon
the central question before us is how shall we use that peace,1973-Nixon
let us resolve that this era we are about to enter will not be what other postwar periods have so often been a time of retreat and isolation that leads to stagnation at home and invites new danger abroad,1973-Nixon
let us resolve that this will be what it can become a time of great responsibilities greatly borne in which we renew the spirit and the promise of america as we enter our third century as a nation,1973-Nixon
this past year saw far reaching results from our new policies for peace,1973-Nixon
by continuing to revitalize our traditional friendships and by our missions to peking and to moscow we were able to establish the base for a new and more durable pattern of relationships among the nations of the world,1973-Nixon
because of america s bold initiatives 1972 will be long remembered as the year of the greatest progress since the end of world war ii toward a lasting peace in the world,1973-Nixon
the peace we seek in the world is not the flimsy peace which is merely an interlude between wars but a peace which can endure for generations to come,1973-Nixon
it is important that we understand both the necessity and the limitations of america s role in maintaining that peace,1973-Nixon
unless we in america work to preserve the peace there will be no peace,1973-Nixon
unless we in america work to preserve freedom there will be no freedom,1973-Nixon
but let us clearly understand the new nature of america s role as a result of the new policies we have adopted over these past four years,1973-Nixon
we shall respect our treaty commitments,1973-Nixon
we shall support vigorously the principle that no country has the right to impose its will or rule on another by force,1973-Nixon
we shall continue in this era of negotiation to work for the limitation of nuclear arms and to reduce the danger of confrontation between the great powers,1973-Nixon
we shall do our share in defending peace and freedom in the world,1973-Nixon
but we shall expect others to do their share,1973-Nixon
the time has passed when america will make every other nation s conflict our own or make every other nation s future our responsibility or presume to tell the people of other nations how to manage their own affairs,1973-Nixon
just as we respect the right of each nation to determine its own future we also recognize the responsibility of each nation to secure its own future,1973-Nixon
just as america s role is indispensable in preserving the world s peace so is each nation s role indispensable in preserving its own peace,1973-Nixon
together with the rest of the world let us resolve to move forward from the beginnings we have made,1973-Nixon
let us continue to bring down the walls of hostility which have divided the world for too long and to build in their place bridges of understanding so that despite profound differences between systems of government the people of the world can be friends,1973-Nixon
let us build a structure of peace in the world in which the weak are as safe as the strong in which each respects the right of the other to live by a different system in which those who would influence others will do so by the strength of their ideas and not by the force of their arms,1973-Nixon
let us accept that high responsibility not as a burden but gladly gladly because the chance to build such a peace is the noblest endeavor in which a nation can engage gladly also because only if we act greatly in meeting our responsibilities abroad will we remain a great nation and only if we remain a great nation will we act greatly in meeting our challenges at home,1973-Nixon
we have the chance today to do more than ever before in our history to make life better in america to ensure better education better health better housing better transportation a cleaner environment to restore respect for law to make our communities more livable and to insure the god given right of every american to full and equal opportunity,1973-Nixon
because the range of our needs is so great because the reach of our opportunities is so great let us be bold in our determination to meet those needs in new ways,1973-Nixon
just as building a structure of peace abroad has required turning away from old policies that failed so building a new era of progress at home requires turning away from old policies that have failed,1973-Nixon
abroad the shift from old policies to new has not been a retreat from our responsibilities but a better way to peace,1973-Nixon
and at home the shift from old policies to new will not be a retreat from our responsibilities but a better way to progress,1973-Nixon
abroad and at home the key to those new responsibilities lies in the placing and the division of responsibility,1973-Nixon
we have lived too long with the consequences of attempting to gather all power and responsibility in washington,1973-Nixon
abroad and at home the time has come to turn away from the condescending policies of paternalism of washington knows best,1973-Nixon
a person can be expected to act responsibly only if he has responsibility,1973-Nixon
this is human nature,1973-Nixon
so let us encourage individuals at home and nations abroad to do more for themselves to decide more for themselves,1973-Nixon
let us locate responsibility in more places,1973-Nixon
let us measure what we will do for others by what they will do for themselves,1973-Nixon
that is why today i offer no promise of a purely governmental solution for every problem,1973-Nixon
we have lived too long with that false promise,1973-Nixon
in trusting too much in government we have asked of it more than it can deliver,1973-Nixon
this leads only to inflated expectations to reduced individual effort and to a disappointment and frustration that erode confidence both in what government can do and in what people can do,1973-Nixon
government must learn to take less from people so that people an do more for themselves,1973-Nixon
let us remember that america was built not by government but by people not by welfare but by work not by shirking responsibility but by seeking responsibility,1973-Nixon
in our own lives let each of us ask not just what will government do for me but what can i do for myself,1973-Nixon
in the challenges we face together let each of us ask not just how can government help but how can i help,1973-Nixon
your national government has a great and vital role to play,1973-Nixon
and i pledge to you that where this government should act we will act boldly and we will lead boldly,1973-Nixon
but just as important is the role that each and every one of us must play as an individual and as a member of his own community,1973-Nixon
from this day forward let each of us make a solemn commitment in his own heart to bear his responsibility to do his part to live his ideals so that together we can see the dawn of a new age of progress for america and together as we celebrate our 200th anniversary as a nation we can do so proud in the fulfillment of our promise to ourselves and to the world,1973-Nixon
as america s longest and most difficult war comes to an end let us again learn to debate our differences with civility and decency,1973-Nixon
and let each of us reach out for that one precious quality government cannot provide a new level of respect for the rights and feelings of one another a new level of respect for the individual human dignity which is the cherished birthright of every american,1973-Nixon
above all else the time has come for us to renew our faith in ourselves and in america,1973-Nixon
in recent years that faith has been challenged,1973-Nixon
our children have been taught to be ashamed of their country ashamed of their parents ashamed of america s record at home and of its role in the world,1973-Nixon
at every turn we have been beset by those who find everything wrong with america and little that is right,1973-Nixon
but i am confident that this will not be the judgment of history on these remarkable times in which we are privileged to live,1973-Nixon
america s record in this century has been unparalleled in the world s history for its responsibility for its generosity for its creativity and for its progress,1973-Nixon
let us be proud that our system has produced and provided more freedom and more abundance more widely shared than any other system in the history of the world,1973-Nixon
let us be proud that in each of the four wars in which we have been engaged in this century including the one we are now bringing to an end we have fought not for our selfish advantage but to help others resist aggression,1973-Nixon
let us be proud that by our bold new initiatives and by our steadfastness for peace with honor we have made a break through toward creating in the world what the world has not known before a structure of peace that can last not merely for our time but for generations to come,1973-Nixon
we are embarking here today on an era that presents challenges great as those any nation or any generation has ever faced,1973-Nixon
we shall answer to god to history and to our conscience for the way in which we use these years,1973-Nixon
as i stand in this place so hallowed by history i think of others who have stood here before me,1973-Nixon
i think of the dreams they had for america and i think of how each recognized that he needed help far beyond himself in order to make those dreams come true,1973-Nixon
today i ask your prayers that in the years ahead i may have god s help in making decisions that are right for america and i pray for your help so that together we may be worthy of our challenge,1973-Nixon
let us pledge together to make these next four years the best four years in america s history so that on its 200th birthday america will be as young and as vital as when it began and as bright a beacon of hope for all the world,1973-Nixon
let us go forward from here confident in hope strong in our faith in one another sustained by our faith in god who created us and striving always to serve his purpose,1973-Nixon
for myself and for our nation i want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land,1977-Carter
in this outward and physical ceremony we attest once again to the inner and spiritual strength of our nation,1977-Carter
as my high school teacher miss julia coleman used to say we must adjust to changing times and still hold to unchanging principles,1977-Carter
here before me is the bible used in the inauguration of our first president in 1789 and i have just taken the oath of office on the bible my mother gave me a few years ago opened to a timeless admonition from the ancient prophet micah,1977-Carter
he hath showed thee o man what is good and what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god,1977-Carter
micah 6 8 this inauguration ceremony marks a new beginning a new dedication within our government and a new spirit among us all,1977-Carter
a president may sense and proclaim that new spirit but only a people can provide it,1977-Carter
two centuries ago our nation s birth was a milestone in the long quest for freedom but the bold and brilliant dream which excited the founders of this nation still awaits its consummation,1977-Carter
i have no new dream to set forth today but rather urge a fresh faith in the old dream,1977-Carter
ours was the first society openly to define itself in terms of both spirituality and of human liberty,1977-Carter
it is that unique self definition which has given us an exceptional appeal but it also imposes on us a special obligation to take on those moral duties which when assumed seem invariably to be in our own best interests,1977-Carter
you have given me a great responsibility to stay close to you to be worthy of you and to exemplify what you are,1977-Carter
let us create together a new national spirit of unity and trust,1977-Carter
your strength can compensate for my weakness and your wisdom can help to minimize my mistakes,1977-Carter
let us learn together and laugh together and work together and pray together confident that in the end we will triumph together in the right,1977-Carter
the american dream endures,1977-Carter
we must once again have full faith in our country and in one another,1977-Carter
i believe america can be better,1977-Carter
we can be even stronger than before,1977-Carter
let our recent mistakes bring a resurgent commitment to the basic principles of our nation for we know that if we despise our own government we have no future,1977-Carter
we recall in special times when we have stood briefly but magnificently united,1977-Carter
in those times no prize was beyond our grasp,1977-Carter
but we cannot dwell upon remembered glory,1977-Carter
we cannot afford to drift,1977-Carter
we reject the prospect of failure or mediocrity or an inferior quality of life for any person,1977-Carter
our government must at the same time be both competent and compassionate,1977-Carter
we have already found a high degree of personal liberty and we are now struggling to enhance equality of opportunity,1977-Carter
our commitment to human rights must be absolute our laws fair our natural beauty preserved the powerful must not persecute the weak and human dignity must be enhanced,1977-Carter
we have learned that more is not necessarily better that even our great nation has its recognized limits and that we can neither answer all questions nor solve all problems,1977-Carter
we cannot afford to do everything nor can we afford to lack boldness as we meet the future,1977-Carter
so together in a spirit of individual sacrifice for the common good we must simply do our best,1977-Carter
our nation can be strong abroad only if it is strong at home,1977-Carter
and we know that the best way to enhance freedom in other lands is to demonstrate here that our democratic system is worthy of emulation,1977-Carter
to be true to ourselves we must be true to others,1977-Carter
we will not behave in foreign places so as to violate our rules and standards here at home for we know that the trust which our nation earns is essential to our strength,1977-Carter
the world itself is now dominated by a new spirit,1977-Carter
people are more numerous and more politically aware are craving and now demanding their place in the sun not just for the benefit of their own physical condition but for basic human rights,1977-Carter
the passion for freedom is on the rise,1977-Carter
tapping this new spirit there can be no nobler nor more ambitious task for america to undertake on this day of a new beginning than to help shape a just and peaceful world that is truly humane,1977-Carter
we are a strong nation and we will maintain strength so sufficient that it need not be proven in combat a quiet strength based not merely on the size of an arsenal but on the nobility of ideas,1977-Carter
we will be ever vigilant and never vulnerable and we will fight our wars against poverty ignorance and injustice for those are the enemies against which our forces can be honorably marshaled,1977-Carter
we are a purely idealistic nation but let no one confuse our idealism with weakness,1977-Carter
because we are free we can never be indifferent to the fate of freedom elsewhere,1977-Carter
our moral sense dictates a clearcut preference for these societies which share with us an abiding respect for individual human rights,1977-Carter
we do not seek to intimidate but it is clear that a world which others can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well being of all people,1977-Carter
the world is still engaged in a massive armaments race designed to ensure continuing equivalent strength among potential adversaries,1977-Carter
we pledge perseverance and wisdom in our efforts to limit the world s armaments to those necessary for each nation s own domestic safety,1977-Carter
and we will move this year a step toward ultimate goal the elimination of all nuclear weapons from this earth,1977-Carter
we urge all other people to join us for success can mean life instead of death,1977-Carter
within us the people of the united states there is evident a serious and purposeful rekindling of confidence,1977-Carter
and i join in the hope that when my time as your president has ended people might say this about our nation that we had remembered the words of micah and renewed our search for humility mercy and justice that we had torn down the barriers that separated those of different race and region and religion and where there had been mistrust built unity with a respect for diversity that we had found productive work for those able to perform it that we had strengthened the american family which is the basi of our society that we had ensured respect for the law and equal treatment under the law for the weak and the powerful for the rich and the poor and that we had enabled our people to be proud of their own government once again,1977-Carter
i would hope that the nations of the world might say that we had built a lasting peace built not on weapons of war but on international policies which reflect our own most precious values,1977-Carter
these are not just my goals and they will not be my accomplishments but the affirmation of our nation s continuing moral strength and our belief in an undiminished ever expanding american dream,1977-Carter
senator hatfield mr chief justice mr president vice president bush vice president mondale senator baker speaker o neill reverend moomaw and my fellow citizens to a few of us here today this is a solemn and most momentous occasion and yet in the history of our nation it is a commonplace occurrence,1981-Reagan
the orderly transfer of authority as called for in the constitution routinely takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few of us stop to think how unique we really are,1981-Reagan
in the eyes of many in the world this every 4 year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle,1981-Reagan
mr president i want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition,1981-Reagan
by your gracious cooperation in the transition process you have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other and i thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our republic,1981-Reagan
the business of our nation goes forward,1981-Reagan
these united states are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions,1981-Reagan
we suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history,1981-Reagan
it distorts our economic decisions penalizes thrift and crushes the struggling young and the fixed income elderly alike,1981-Reagan
it threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people,1981-Reagan
idle industries have cast workers into unemployment causing human misery and personal indignity,1981-Reagan
those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity,1981-Reagan
but great as our tax burden is it has not kept pace with public spending,1981-Reagan
for decades we have piled deficit upon deficit mortgaging our future and our children s future for the temporary convenience of the present,1981-Reagan
to continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social cultural political and economic upheavals,1981-Reagan
you and i as individuals can by borrowing live beyond our means but for only a limited period of time,1981-Reagan
why then should we think that collectively as a nation we are not bound by that same limitation,1981-Reagan
we must act today in order to preserve tomorrow,1981-Reagan
and let there be no misunderstanding we are going to begin to act beginning today,1981-Reagan
the economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades,1981-Reagan
they will not go away in days weeks or months but they will go away,1981-Reagan
they will go away because we as americans have the capacity now as we have had in the past to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom,1981-Reagan
in this present crisis government is not the solution to our problem,1981-Reagan
from time to time we have been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self rule that government by an elite group is superior to government for by and of the people,1981-Reagan
but if no one among us is capable of governing himself then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else,1981-Reagan
all of us together in and out of government must bear the burden,1981-Reagan
the solutions we seek must be equitable with no one group singled out to pay a higher price,1981-Reagan
we hear much of special interest groups,1981-Reagan
our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected,1981-Reagan
it knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions and it crosses political party lines,1981-Reagan
it is made up of men and women who raise our food patrol our streets man our mines and our factories teach our children keep our homes and heal us when we are sick professionals industrialists shopkeepers clerks cabbies and truckdrivers,1981-Reagan
they are in short we the people this breed called americans,1981-Reagan
well this administration s objective will be a healthy vigorous growing economy that provides equal opportunity for all americans with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination,1981-Reagan
putting america back to work means putting all americans back to work,1981-Reagan
ending inflation means freeing all americans from the terror of runaway living costs,1981-Reagan
all must share in the productive work of this new beginning and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy,1981-Reagan
with the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength we can have a strong and prosperous america at peace with itself and the world,1981-Reagan
so as we begin let us take inventory,1981-Reagan
we are a nation that has a government not the other way around,1981-Reagan
and this makes us special among the nations of the earth,1981-Reagan
our government has no power except that granted it by the people,1981-Reagan
it is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed,1981-Reagan
it is my intention to curb the size and influence of the federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the federal government and those reserved to the states or to the people,1981-Reagan
all of us need to be reminded that the federal government did not create the states the states created the federal government,1981-Reagan
now so there will be no misunderstanding it is not my intention to do away with government,1981-Reagan
it is rather to make it work work with us not over us to stand by our side not ride on our back,1981-Reagan
government can and must provide opportunity not smother it foster productivity not stifle it,1981-Reagan
if we look to the answer as to why for so many years we achieved so much prospered as no other people on earth it was because here in this land we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before,1981-Reagan
freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on earth,1981-Reagan
the price for this freedom at times has been high but we have never been unwilling to pay that price,1981-Reagan
it is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government,1981-Reagan
it is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams,1981-Reagan
we are not as some would have us believe loomed to an inevitable decline,1981-Reagan
i do not believe in a fate that will all on us no matter what we do,1981-Reagan
i do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing,1981-Reagan
so with all the creative energy at our command let us begin an era of national renewal,1981-Reagan
let us renew our determination our courage and our strength,1981-Reagan
and let us renew our faith and our hope,1981-Reagan
we have every right to dream heroic dreams,1981-Reagan
those who say that we are in a time when there are no heroes just don t know where to look,1981-Reagan
you can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates,1981-Reagan
others a handful in number produce enough food to feed all of us and then the world beyond,1981-Reagan
you meet heroes across a counter and they are on both sides of that counter,1981-Reagan
there are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs new wealth and opportunity,1981-Reagan
they are individuals and families whose taxes support the government and whose voluntary gifts support church charity culture art and education,1981-Reagan
their patriotism is quiet but deep,1981-Reagan
their values sustain our national life,1981-Reagan
i have used the words they and their in speaking of these heroes,1981-Reagan
i could say you and your because i am addressing the heroes of whom i speak you the citizens of this blessed land,1981-Reagan
your dreams your hopes your goals are going to be the dreams the hopes and the goals of this administration so help me god,1981-Reagan
we shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your makeup,1981-Reagan
how can we love our country and not love our countrymen and loving them reach out a hand when they fall heal them when they are sick and provide opportunities to make them self sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory,1981-Reagan
can we solve the problems confronting us,1981-Reagan
well the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic yes,1981-Reagan
to paraphrase winston churchill i did not take the oath i have just taken with the intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world s strongest economy,1981-Reagan
in the days ahead i will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity,1981-Reagan
steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government,1981-Reagan
progress may be slow measured in inches and feet not miles but we will progress,1981-Reagan
is it time to reawaken this industrial giant to get government back within its means and to lighten our punitive tax burden,1981-Reagan
and these will be our first priorities and on these principles there will be no compromise,1981-Reagan
on the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have been one of the greatest among the founding fathers dr joseph warren president of the massachusetts congress said to his fellow americans our country is in danger but not to be despaired of on you depend the fortunes of america,1981-Reagan
you are to decide the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn,1981-Reagan
act worthy of yourselves,1981-Reagan
well i believe we the americans of today are ready to act worthy of ourselves ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness and liberty for ourselves our children and our children s children,1981-Reagan
and as we renew ourselves here in our own land we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world,1981-Reagan
we will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have freedom,1981-Reagan
to those neighbors and allies who share our freedom we will strengthen our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment,1981-Reagan
we will match loyalty with loyalty,1981-Reagan
we will strive for mutually beneficial relations,1981-Reagan
we will not use our friendship to impose on their sovereignty for or own sovereignty is not for sale,1981-Reagan
as for the enemies of freedom those who are potential adversaries they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of the american people,1981-Reagan
we will negotiate for it sacrifice for it we will not surrender for it now or ever,1981-Reagan
our forbearance should never be misunderstood,1981-Reagan
our reluctance for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will,1981-Reagan
when action is required to preserve our national security we will act,1981-Reagan
we will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having to use that strength,1981-Reagan
above all we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women,1981-Reagan
it is a weapon our adversaries in today s world do not have,1981-Reagan
it is a weapon that we as americans do have,1981-Reagan
let that be understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbors,1981-Reagan
i am told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being held on this day and for that i am deeply grateful,1981-Reagan
we are a nation under god and i believe god intended for us to be free,1981-Reagan
it would be fitting and good i think if on each inauguration day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer,1981-Reagan
this is the first time in history that this ceremony has been held as you have been told on this west front of the capitol,1981-Reagan
standing here one faces a magnificent vista opening up on this city s special beauty and history,1981-Reagan
at the end of this open mall are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand,1981-Reagan
directly in front of me the monument to a monumental man george washington father of our country,1981-Reagan
a man of humility who came to greatness reluctantly,1981-Reagan
he led america out of revolutionary victory into infant nationhood,1981-Reagan
off to one side the stately memorial to thomas jefferson,1981-Reagan
the declaration of independence flames with his eloquence,1981-Reagan
and then beyond the reflecting pool the dignified columns of the lincoln memorial,1981-Reagan
whoever would understand in his heart the meaning of america will find it in the life of abraham lincoln,1981-Reagan
beyond those monuments to heroism is the potomac river and on the far shore the sloping hills of arlington national cemetery with its row on row of simple white markers bearing crosses or stars of david,1981-Reagan
they add up to only a tiny fraction of the price that has been paid for our freedom,1981-Reagan
each one of those markers is a monument to the kinds of hero i spoke of earlier,1981-Reagan
their lives ended in places called belleau wood the argonne omaha beach salerno and halfway around the world on guadalcanal tarawa pork chop hill the chosin reservoir and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called vietnam,1981-Reagan
under one such marker lies a young man who left his job in a small town barber shop in 1917 to go to france with the famed rainbow division,1981-Reagan
there on the western front he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire,1981-Reagan
we are told that on his body was found a diary,1981-Reagan
on the flyleaf under the heading my pledge he had written these words america must win this war,1981-Reagan
therefore i will work i will save i will sacrifice i will endure i will fight cheerfully and do my utmost as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone,1981-Reagan
the crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind of sacrifice that martin treptow and so many thousands of others were called upon to make,1981-Reagan
it does require however our best effort and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in our capacity to perform great deeds to believe that together with god s help we can and will resolve the problems which now confront us,1981-Reagan
and after all why shouldn t we believe that,1981-Reagan
we are americans,1981-Reagan
god bless you and thank you,1981-Reagan
senator mathias chief justice burger vice president bush speaker o neill senator dole reverend clergy members of my family and friends and my fellow citizens,1985-Reagan
this day has been made brighter with the presence here of one who for a time has been absent senator john stennis,1985-Reagan
god bless you and welcome back,1985-Reagan
there is however one who is not with us today representative gillis long of louisiana left us last night,1985-Reagan
i wonder if we could all join in a moment of silent prayer,1985-Reagan
moment of silent prayer,1985-Reagan
amen,1985-Reagan
there are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great honor that you have bestowed on me,1985-Reagan
i will do my utmost to be deserving of your trust,1985-Reagan
this is as senator mathias told us the 50th time that we the people have celebrated this historic occasion,1985-Reagan
when the first president george washington placed his hand upon the bible he stood less than a single day s journey by horseback from raw untamed wilderness,1985-Reagan
there were 4 million americans in a union of 13 states,1985-Reagan
today we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 states,1985-Reagan
we have lighted the world with our inventions gone to the aid of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help journeyed to the moon and safely returned,1985-Reagan
so much has changed,1985-Reagan
and yet we stand together as we did two centuries ago,1985-Reagan
when i took this oath four years ago i did so in a time of economic stress,1985-Reagan
voices were raised saying we had to look to our past for the greatness and glory,1985-Reagan
but we the present day americans are not given to looking backward,1985-Reagan
in this blessed land there is always a better tomorrow,1985-Reagan
four years ago i spoke to you of a new beginning and we have accomplished that,1985-Reagan
but in another sense our new beginning is a continuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when for the first time in history government the people said was not our master it is our servant its only power that which we the people allow it to have,1985-Reagan
that system has never failed us but for a time we failed the system,1985-Reagan
we asked things of government that government was not equipped to give,1985-Reagan
we yielded authority to the national government that properly belonged to states or to local governments or to the people themselves,1985-Reagan
we allowed taxes and inflation to rob us of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine that had made us the most productive people on earth slow down and the number of unemployed increase,1985-Reagan
by 1980 we knew it was time to renew our faith to strive with all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly society,1985-Reagan
we believed then and now there are no limits to growth and human progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams,1985-Reagan
and we were right to believe that,1985-Reagan
tax rates have been reduced inflation cut dramatically and more people are employed than ever before in our history,1985-Reagan
we are creating a nation once again vibrant robust and alive,1985-Reagan
but there are many mountains yet to climb,1985-Reagan
we will not rest until every american enjoys the fullness of freedom dignity and opportunity as our birthright,1985-Reagan
it is our birthright as citizens of this great republic and we ll meet this challenge,1985-Reagan
these will be years when americans have restored their confidence and tradition of progress when our values of faith family work and neighborhood were restated for a modern age when our economy was finally freed from government s grip when we made sincere efforts at meaningful arms reduction rebuilding our defenses our economy and developing new technologies and helped preserve peace in a troubled world when americans courageously supported the struggle for liberty self government and free enterprise throughout the world and turned the tide of history away from totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom,1985-Reagan
my fellow citizens our nation is poised for greatness,1985-Reagan
we must do what we know is right and do it with all our might,1985-Reagan
let history say of us these were golden years when the american revolution was reborn when freedom gained new life when america reached for her best,1985-Reagan
our two party system has served us well over the years but never better than in those times of great challenge when we came together not as democrats or republicans but as americans united in a common cause,1985-Reagan
two of our founding fathers a boston lawyer named adams and a virginia planter named jefferson members of that remarkable group who met in independence hall and dared to think they could start the world over again left us an important lesson,1985-Reagan
they had become political rivals in the presidential election of 1800,1985-Reagan
then years later when both were retired and age had softened their anger they began to speak to each other again through letters,1985-Reagan
a bond was reestablished between those two who had helped create this government of ours,1985-Reagan
in 1826 the 50th anniversary of the declaration of independence they both died,1985-Reagan
they died on the same day within a few hours of each other and that day was the fourth of july,1985-Reagan
in one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives jefferson wrote it carries me back to the times when beset with difficulties and dangers we were fellow laborers in the same cause struggling for what is most valuable to man his right to self government,1985-Reagan
laboring always at the same oar with some wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us and yet passing harmless we rode through the storm with heart and hand,1985-Reagan
well with heart and hand let us stand as one today one people under god determined that our future shall be worthy of our past,1985-Reagan
as we do we must not repeat the well intentioned errors of our past,1985-Reagan
we must never again abuse the trust of working men and women by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling demands of a bloated federal establishment,1985-Reagan
you elected us in 1980 to end this prescription for disaster and i don t believe you reelected us in 1984 to reverse course,1985-Reagan
at the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25 straight months of economic growth freedom and incentives unleash the drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress,1985-Reagan
we have begun to increase the rewards for work savings and investment reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its interference in people s lives,1985-Reagan
we must simplify our tax system make it more fair and bring the rates down for all who work and earn,1985-Reagan
we must think anew and move with a new boldness so every american who seeks work can find work so the least among us shall have an equal chance to achieve the greatest things to be heroes who heal our sick feed the hungry protect peace among nations and leave this world a better place,1985-Reagan
the time has come for a new american emancipation a great national drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country,1985-Reagan
my friends together we can do this and do it we must so help me god,1985-Reagan
from new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth a more productive fulfilled and united people and a stronger america an america that will lead the technological revolution and also open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature music and poetry and the values of faith courage and love,1985-Reagan
a dynamic economy with more citizens working and paying taxes will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits,1985-Reagan
but an almost unbroken 50 years of deficit spending has finally brought us to a time of reckoning,1985-Reagan
we have come to a turning point a moment for hard decisions,1985-Reagan
i have asked the cabinet and my staff a question and now i put the same question to all of you if not us who,1985-Reagan
and if not now when,1985-Reagan
it must be done by all of us going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget,1985-Reagan
we can then begin reducing the national debt,1985-Reagan
i will shortly submit a budget to the congress aimed at freezing government program spending for the next year,1985-Reagan
beyond that we must take further steps to permanently control government s power to tax and spend,1985-Reagan
we must act now to protect future generations from government s desire to spend its citizens money and tax them into servitude when the bills come due,1985-Reagan
let us make it unconstitutional for the federal government to spend more than the federal government takes in,1985-Reagan
we have already started returning to the people and to state and local governments responsibilities better handled by them,1985-Reagan
now there is a place for the federal government in matters of social compassion,1985-Reagan
but our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged,1985-Reagan
and here a growing economy and support from family and community offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way of life where the old and infirm are cared for the young and yes the unborn protected and the unfortunate looked after and made self,1985-Reagan
and there is another area where the federal government can play a part,1985-Reagan
as an older american i remember a time when people of different race creed or ethnic origin in our land found hatred and prejudice installed in social custom and yes in law,1985-Reagan
there is no story more heartening in our history than the progress that we have made toward the brotherhood of man that god intended for us,1985-Reagan
let us resolve there will be no turning back or hesitation on the road to an america rich in dignity and abundant with opportunity for all our citizens,1985-Reagan
let us resolve that we the people will build an american opportunity society in which all of us white and black rich and poor young and old will go forward together arm in arm,1985-Reagan
again let us remember that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner of the earth we are all americans pledged to carry on this last best hope of man on earth,1985-Reagan
i have spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations which we should put on our national government,1985-Reagan
now let me turn to a task which is the primary responsibility of national government the safety and security of our people,1985-Reagan
today we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer for peace on earth,1985-Reagan
yet history has shown that peace will not come nor will our freedom be preserved by good will alone,1985-Reagan
there are those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and freedom,1985-Reagan
one nation the soviet union has conducted the greatest military buildup in the history of man building arsenals of awesome offensive weapons,1985-Reagan
we have made progress in restoring our defense capability,1985-Reagan
but much remains to be done,1985-Reagan
there must be no wavering by us nor any doubts by others that america will meet her responsibilities to remain free secure and at peace,1985-Reagan
there is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost of national security and that is to reduce the need for it,1985-Reagan
and this we are trying to do in negotiations with the soviet union,1985-Reagan
we are not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear weapons,1985-Reagan
we seek instead to reduce their number,1985-Reagan
we seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth,1985-Reagan
now for decades we and the soviets have lived under the threat of mutual assured destruction if either resorted to the use of nuclear weapons the other could retaliate and destroy the one who had started it,1985-Reagan
is there either logic or morality in believing that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs,1985-Reagan
i have approved a research program to find if we can a security shield that would destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their target,1985-Reagan
it wouldn t kill people it would destroy weapons,1985-Reagan
it wouldn t militarize space it would help demilitarize the arsenals of earth,1985-Reagan
it would render nuclear weapons obsolete,1985-Reagan
we will meet with the soviets hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the world of the threat of nuclear destruction,1985-Reagan
we strive for peace and security heartened by the changes all around us,1985-Reagan
since the turn of the century the number of democracies in the world has grown fourfold,1985-Reagan
human freedom is on the march and nowhere more so than our own hemisphere,1985-Reagan
freedom is one of the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit,1985-Reagan
people worldwide hunger for the right of self determination for those inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress,1985-Reagan
america must remain freedom s staunchest friend for freedom is our best ally,1985-Reagan
and it is the world s only hope to conquer poverty and preserve peace,1985-Reagan
every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against its dark allies of oppression and war,1985-Reagan
every victory for human freedom will be a victory for world peace,1985-Reagan
so we go forward today a nation still mighty in its youth and powerful in its purpose,1985-Reagan
with our alliances strengthened with our economy leading the world to a new age of economic expansion we look forward to a world rich in possibilities,1985-Reagan
and all this because we have worked and acted together not as members of political parties but as americans,1985-Reagan
my friends we live in a world that is lit by lightning,1985-Reagan
so much is changing and will change but so much endures and transcends time,1985-Reagan
history is a ribbon always unfurling history is a journey,1985-Reagan
and as we continue our journey we think of those who traveled before us,1985-Reagan
we stand together again at the steps of this symbol of our democracy or we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn t gotten so cold,1985-Reagan
now we are standing inside this symbol of our democracy,1985-Reagan
now we hear again the echoes of our past a general falls to his knees in the hard snow of valley forge a lonely president paces the darkened halls and ponders his struggle to preserve the union the men of the alamo call out encouragement to each other a settler pushes west and sings a song and the song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air,1985-Reagan
it is the american sound,1985-Reagan
it is hopeful big hearted idealistic daring decent and fair,1985-Reagan
that s our heritage that is our song,1985-Reagan
we sing it still,1985-Reagan
for all our problems our differences we are together as of old as we raise our voices to the god who is the author of this most tender music,1985-Reagan
and may he continue to hold us close as we fill the world with our sound sound in unity affection and love one people under god dedicated to the dream of freedom that he has placed in the human heart called upon now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world,1985-Reagan
god bless you and may god bless america,1985-Reagan
mr chief justice mr president vice president quayle senator mitchell speaker wright senator dole congressman michael and fellow citizens neighbors and friends,1989-Bush
there is a man here who has earned a lasting place in our hearts and in our history,1989-Bush
president reagan on behalf of our nation i thank you for the wonderful things that you have done for america,1989-Bush
i have just repeated word for word the oath taken by george washington 200 years ago and the bible on which i placed my hand is the bible on which he placed his,1989-Bush
it is right that the memory of washington be with us today not only because this is our bicentennial inauguration but because washington remains the father of our country,1989-Bush
and he would i think be gladdened by this day for today is the concrete expression of a stunning fact our continuity these 200 years since our government began,1989-Bush
we meet on democracy s front porch a good place to talk as neighbors and as friends,1989-Bush
for this is a day when our nation is made whole when our differences for a moment are suspended,1989-Bush
and my first act as president is a prayer,1989-Bush
i ask you to bow your heads,1989-Bush
heavenly father we bow our heads and thank you for your love,1989-Bush
accept our thanks for the peace that yields this day and the shared faith that makes its continuance likely,1989-Bush
make us strong to do your work willing to heed and hear your will and write on our hearts these words use power to help people,1989-Bush
for we are given power not to advance our own purposes nor to make a great show in the world nor a name,1989-Bush
there is but one just use of power and it is to serve people,1989-Bush
help us to remember it lord,1989-Bush
amen,1989-Bush
i come before you and assume the presidency at a moment rich with promise,1989-Bush
we live in a peaceful prosperous time but we can make it better,1989-Bush
for a new breeze is blowing and a world refreshed by freedom seems reborn for in man s heart if not in fact the day of the dictator is over,1989-Bush
the totalitarian era is passing its old ideas blown away like leaves from an ancient lifeless tree,1989-Bush
a new breeze is blowing and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push on,1989-Bush
there is new ground to be broken and new action to be taken,1989-Bush
there are times when the future seems thick as a fog you sit and wait hoping the mists will lift and reveal the right path,1989-Bush
but this is a time when the future seems a door you can walk right through into a room called tomorrow,1989-Bush
great nations of the world are moving toward democracy through the door to freedom,1989-Bush
men and women of the world move toward free markets through the door to prosperity,1989-Bush
the people of the world agitate for free expression and free thought through the door to the moral and intellectual satisfactions that only liberty allows,1989-Bush
we know what works freedom works,1989-Bush
we know what s right freedom is right,1989-Bush
we know how to secure a more just and prosperous life for man on earth through free markets free speech free elections and the exercise of free will unhampered by the state,1989-Bush
for the first time in this century for the first time in perhaps all history man does not have to invent a system by which to live,1989-Bush
we don t have to talk late into the night about which form of government is better,1989-Bush
we don t have to wrest justice from the kings,1989-Bush
we only have to summon it from within ourselves,1989-Bush
we must act on what we know,1989-Bush
i take as my guide the hope of a saint in crucial things unity in important things diversity in all things generosity,1989-Bush
america today is a proud free nation decent and civil a place we cannot help but love,1989-Bush
we know in our hearts not loudly and proudly but as a simple fact that this country has meaning beyond what we see and that our strength is a force for good,1989-Bush
but have we changed as a nation even in our time,1989-Bush
are we enthralled with material things less appreciative of the nobility of work and sacrifice,1989-Bush
my friends we are not the sum of our possessions,1989-Bush
they are not the measure of our lives,1989-Bush
in our hearts we know what matters,1989-Bush
we cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger car a bigger bank account,1989-Bush
we must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal friend a loving parent a citizen who leaves his home his neighborhood and town better than he found it,1989-Bush
what do we want the men and women who work with us to say when we are no longer there,1989-Bush
that we were more driven to succeed than anyone around us,1989-Bush
or that we stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better and stayed a moment there to trade a word of friendship,1989-Bush
no president no government can teach us to remember what is best in what we are,1989-Bush
but if the man you have chosen to lead this government can help make a difference if he can celebrate the quieter deeper successes that are made not of gold and silk but of better hearts and finer souls if he can do these things then he must,1989-Bush
america is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in high moral principle,1989-Bush
we as a people have such a purpose today,1989-Bush
it is to make kinder the face of the nation and gentler the face of the world,1989-Bush
my friends we have work to do,1989-Bush
there are the homeless lost and roaming,1989-Bush
there are the children who have nothing no love no normalcy,1989-Bush
there are those who cannot free themselves of enslavement to whatever addiction drugs welfare the demoralization that rules the slums,1989-Bush
there is crime to be conquered the rough crime of the streets,1989-Bush
there are young women to be helped who are about to become mothers of children they can t care for and might not love,1989-Bush
they need our care our guidance and our education though we bless them for choosing life,1989-Bush
the old solution the old way was to think that public money alone could end these problems,1989-Bush
but we have learned that is not so,1989-Bush
and in any case our funds are low,1989-Bush
we have a deficit to bring down,1989-Bush
we have more will than wallet but will is what we need,1989-Bush
we will make the hard choices looking at what we have and perhaps allocating it differently making our decisions based on honest need and prudent safety,1989-Bush
and then we will do the wisest thing of all we will turn to the only resource we have that in times of need always grows the goodness and the courage of the american people,1989-Bush
i am speaking of a new engagement in the lives of others a new activism hands on and involved that gets the job done,1989-Bush
we must bring in the generations harnessing the unused talent of the elderly and the unfocused energy of the young,1989-Bush
for not only leadership is passed from generation to generation but so is stewardship,1989-Bush
and the generation born after the second world war has come of age,1989-Bush
i have spoken of a thousand points of light of all the community organizations that are spread like stars throughout the nation doing good,1989-Bush
we will work hand in hand encouraging sometimes leading sometimes being led rewarding,1989-Bush
we will work on this in the white house in the cabinet agencies,1989-Bush
i will go to the people and the programs that are the brighter points of light and i will ask every member of my government to become involved,1989-Bush
the old ideas are new again because they are not old they are timeless duty sacrifice commitment and a patriotism that finds its expression in taking part and pitching in,1989-Bush
we need a new engagement too between the executive and the congress,1989-Bush
the challenges before us will be thrashed out with the house and the senate,1989-Bush
we must bring the federal budget into balance,1989-Bush
and we must ensure that america stands before the world united strong at peace and fiscally sound,1989-Bush
but of course things may be difficult,1989-Bush
we need compromise we have had dissension,1989-Bush
we need harmony we have had a chorus of discordant voices,1989-Bush
for congress too has changed in our time,1989-Bush
there has grown a certain divisiveness,1989-Bush
we have seen the hard looks and heard the statements in which not each other s ideas are challenged but each other s motives,1989-Bush
and our great parties have too often been far apart and untrusting of each other,1989-Bush
it has been this way since vietnam,1989-Bush
that war cleaves us still,1989-Bush
but friends that war began in earnest a quarter of a century ago and surely the statute of limitations has been reached,1989-Bush
this is a fact the final lesson of vietnam is that no great nation can long afford to be sundered by a memory,1989-Bush
a new breeze is blowing and the old bipartisanship must be made new again,1989-Bush
to my friends and yes i do mean friends in the loyal opposition and yes i mean loyal i put out my hand,1989-Bush
i am putting out my hand to you mr speaker,1989-Bush
i am putting out my hand to you mr,1989-Bush
majority leader,1989-Bush
for this is the thing this is the age of the offered hand,1989-Bush
we can t turn back clocks and i don t want to,1989-Bush
but when our fathers were young mr speaker our differences ended at the water s edge,1989-Bush
and we don t wish to turn back time but when our mothers were young mr,1989-Bush
majority leader the congress and the executive were capable of working together to produce a budget on which this nation could live,1989-Bush
let us negotiate soon and hard,1989-Bush
but in the end let us produce,1989-Bush
the american people await action,1989-Bush
they didn t send us here to bicker,1989-Bush
they ask us to rise above the merely partisan,1989-Bush
in crucial things unity and this my friends is crucial,1989-Bush
to the world too we offer new engagement and a renewed vow we will stay strong to protect the peace,1989-Bush
the offered hand is a reluctant fist but once made strong and can be used with great effect,1989-Bush
there are today americans who are held against their will in foreign lands and americans who are unaccounted for,1989-Bush
assistance can be shown here and will be long remembered,1989-Bush
good will begets good will,1989-Bush
good faith can be a spiral that endlessly moves on,1989-Bush
great nations like great men must keep their word,1989-Bush
when america says something america means it whether a treaty or an agreement or a vow made on marble steps,1989-Bush
we will always try to speak clearly for candor is a compliment but subtlety too is good and has its place,1989-Bush
while keeping our alliances and friendships around the world strong ever strong we will continue the new closeness with the soviet union consistent both with our security and with progress,1989-Bush
one might say that our new relationship in part reflects the triumph of hope and strength over experience,1989-Bush
but hope is good and so are strength and vigilance,1989-Bush
here today are tens of thousands of our citizens who feel the understandable satisfaction of those who have taken part in democracy and seen their hopes fulfilled,1989-Bush
but my thoughts have been turning the past few days to those who would be watching at home to an older fellow who will throw a salute by himself when the flag goes by and the women who will tell her sons the words of the battle hymns,1989-Bush
i don t mean this to be sentimental,1989-Bush
i mean that on days like this we remember that we are all part of a continuum inescapably connected by the ties that bind,1989-Bush
our children are watching in schools throughout our great land,1989-Bush
and to them i say thank you for watching democracy s big day,1989-Bush
for democracy belongs to us all and freedom is like a beautiful kite that can go higher and higher with the breeze,1989-Bush
and to all i say no matter what your circumstances or where you are you are part of this day you are part of the life of our great nation,1989-Bush
a president is neither prince nor pope and i don t seek a window on men s souls,1989-Bush
in fact i yearn for a greater tolerance an easy goingness about each other s attitudes and way of life,1989-Bush
there are few clear areas in which we as a society must rise up united and express our intolerance,1989-Bush
the most obvious now is drugs,1989-Bush
and when that first cocaine was smuggled in on a ship it may as well have been a deadly bacteria so much has it hurt the body the soul of our country,1989-Bush
and there is much to be done and to be said but take my word for it this scourge will stop,1989-Bush
and so there is much to do and tomorrow the work begins,1989-Bush
i do not mistrust the future i do not fear what is ahead,1989-Bush
for our problems are large but our heart is larger,1989-Bush
our challenges are great but our will is greater,1989-Bush
and if our flaws are endless god s love is truly boundless,1989-Bush
some see leadership as high drama and the sound of trumpets calling and sometimes it is that,1989-Bush
but i see history as a book with many pages and each day we fill a page with acts of hopefulness and meaning,1989-Bush
the new breeze blows a page turns the story unfolds,1989-Bush
and so today a chapter begins a small and stately story of unity diversity and generosity shared and written together,1989-Bush
thank you,1989-Bush
god bless you and god bless the united states of america,1989-Bush
my fellow citizens today we celebrate the mystery of american renewal,1993-Clinton
this ceremony is held in the depth of winter but by the words we speak and the faces we show the world we force the spring,1993-Clinton
a spring reborn in the world s oldest democracy that brings forth the vision and courage to reinvent america,1993-Clinton
when our founders boldly declared america s independence to the world and our purposes to the almighty they knew that america to endure would have to change,1993-Clinton
not change for change sake but change to preserve america s ideals life liberty the pursuit of happiness,1993-Clinton
though we march to the music of our time our mission is timeless,1993-Clinton
each generation of american s must define what it means to be an american,1993-Clinton
on behalf of our nation i salute my predecessor president bush for his half century of service to america and i thank the millions of men and women whose steadfastness and sacrifice triumphed over depression fascism and communism,1993-Clinton
today a generation raised in the shadows of the cold war assumes new responsibilities in a world warmed by the sunshine of freedom but threatened still by ancient hatreds and new plagues,1993-Clinton
raised in unrivalled prosperity we inherit an economy that is still the world s strongest but is weakened by business failures stagnant wages increasing inequality and deep divisions among our own people,1993-Clinton
when george washington first took the oath i have just sworn to uphold news travelled slowly across the land by horseback and across the ocean by boat,1993-Clinton
now the sights and sounds of this ceremony are broadcast instantaneously tobillions around the world,1993-Clinton
communications and commerce are global,1993-Clinton
investment is mobile,1993-Clinton
technology is almost magical and ambition for a better life is now universal,1993-Clinton
we earn our livelihood in america today in peaceful competition with people all across the earth,1993-Clinton
profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world and the urgent question of our time is whether we can make change our friend and not our enemy,1993-Clinton
this new world has already enriched the lives of millions of americans who are able to compete and win in it,1993-Clinton
but when most people are working harder for less when others cannot work at all when the cost of health care devastates families and threatens to bankrupt our enterprises great and small when the fear of crime robs law abiding citizens of their freedom and when millions of poor children cannot even imagine the lives we are calling them to lead we have not made change our friend,1993-Clinton
we know we have to face hard truths and take strong steps but we have not done so,1993-Clinton
instead we have drifted and that drifting has eroded our resources fractured our economy and shaken our confidence,1993-Clinton
though our challenges are fearsome so are our strengths,1993-Clinton
americans have ever been a restless questing hopeful people and we must bring to our task today the vision and will of those who came before us,1993-Clinton
from our revolution to the civil war to the great depression to the civil rights movement our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history,1993-Clinton
thomas jefferson believed that to preserve the very foundations of our nation we would need dramatic change from time to time,1993-Clinton
well my fellow americans this is our time,1993-Clinton
let us embrace it,1993-Clinton
our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal,1993-Clinton
there is nothing wrong with america that cannot be cured by what is right with america,1993-Clinton
and so today we pledge an end to the era of deadlock and drift and a new season of american renewal has begun,1993-Clinton
to renew america we must be bold,1993-Clinton
we must do what no generation has had to do before,1993-Clinton
we must invest more in our own people in their jobs and in their future and at the same time cut our massive debt and we must do so in a world in which we must compete for every opportunity,1993-Clinton
it will not be easy,1993-Clinton
it will require sacrifice but it can be done and done fairly,1993-Clinton
not choosing sacrifice for its own sake but for our own sake,1993-Clinton
we must provide for our nation the way a family provides for its children,1993-Clinton
our founders saw themselves in the light of posterity,1993-Clinton
we can do no less,1993-Clinton
anyone who has ever watched a child s eyes wander into sleep knows what posterity is,1993-Clinton
posterity is the world to come the world for whom we hold our ideals from whom we have borrowed our planet and to whom we bear sacred responsibilities,1993-Clinton
we must do what america does best offer more opportunity to all and demand more responsibility from all,1993-Clinton
it is time to break the bad habit of expecting something for nothing from our government or from each other,1993-Clinton
let us all take more responsibility not only for ourselves and our families but for our communities and our country,1993-Clinton
to renew america we must revitalize our democracy,1993-Clinton
this beautiful capitol like every capitol since the dawn of civilization is often a place of intrigue and calculation,1993-Clinton
powerful people maneuver for position and worry endlessly about who is in and who is out who is up and who is down forgetting those people whose toil and sweat sends us here and paves our way,1993-Clinton
americans deserve better and in this city today there are people who want to do better and so i say to all of you here let us resolve to reform our politics so that power and privilege no longer shout down the voice of the people,1993-Clinton
let us put aside personal advantage so that we can feel the pain and see the promise of america,1993-Clinton
let us resolve to make our government a place for what franklin roosevelt called bold persistent experimentation a government for our tomorrows not our yesterdays,1993-Clinton
let us give this capitol back to the people to whom it belongs,1993-Clinton
to renew america we must meet challenges abroad as well as at home,1993-Clinton
there is no longer a clear division between what is foreign and what is domestic,1993-Clinton
the world economy the world environment the world aids crisis the world arms race they affect us all,1993-Clinton
today as an old order passes the new world is more free but less stable,1993-Clinton
communism s collapse has called forth old animosities and new dangers,1993-Clinton
clearly america must continue to lead the world we did so much to make,1993-Clinton
while america rebuilds at home we will not shrink from the challenges nor fail to seize the opportunities of this new world,1993-Clinton
together with our friends and allies we will work together to shape change lest it engulf us,1993-Clinton
when our vital interests are challenged or the will and conscience of the international community is defied we will act with peaceful diplomacy whenever possible with force when necessary,1993-Clinton
the brave americans serving our nation today in the persian gulf in somalia and wherever else they stand are testament to our resolve but our greatest strength is the power of our ideas which are still new in many lands,1993-Clinton
across the world we see them embraced and we rejoice,1993-Clinton
our hopes our hearts our hands are with those on every continent who are building democracy and freedom,1993-Clinton
their cause is america s cause,1993-Clinton
the american people have summoned the change we celebrate today,1993-Clinton
you have raised your voices in an unmistakable chorus you have cast your votes in historic numbers you have changed the face of congress the presidency and the political process itself,1993-Clinton
yes you my fellow americans have forced the spring,1993-Clinton
now we must do the work the season demands,1993-Clinton
to that work i now turn with all the authority of my office,1993-Clinton
i ask the congress to join with me but no president no congress no government can undertake this mission alone,1993-Clinton
my fellow americans you too must play your part in our renewal,1993-Clinton
i challenge a new generation of young americans to a season of service to act on your idealism by helping troubled children keeping company with those in need reconnecting our torn communities,1993-Clinton
there is so much to be done,1993-Clinton
enough indeed for millions of others who are still young in spirit to give of themselves in service too,1993-Clinton
in serving we recognize a simple but powerful truth we need each other and we must care for one another,1993-Clinton
today we do more than celebrate america we rededicate ourselves to the very idea of america an idea born in revolution and renewed through two centuries of challenge an idea tempered by the knowledge that but for fate we the fortunate and the unfortunate might have been each other an idea ennobled by the faith that our nation can summon from its myriad diversity the deepest measure of unity an idea infused with the conviction that america s journey long heroic journey must go forever upward,1993-Clinton
and so my fellow americans as we stand at the edge of the 21st century let us begin anew with energy and hope with faith and discipline and let us work until our work is done,1993-Clinton
the scripture says and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not,1993-Clinton
from this joyful mountaintop of celebration we hear a call to service in the valley,1993-Clinton
we have heard the trumpets we have changed the guard and now each in our own way and with god s help we must answer the call,1993-Clinton
thank you and god bless you all,1993-Clinton
my fellow citizens at this last presidential inauguration of the 20th century let us lift our eyes toward the challenges that await us in the next century,1997-Clinton
it is our great good fortune that time and chance have put us not only at the edge of a new century in a new millennium but on the edge of a bright new prospect in human affairs a moment that will define our course and our character for decades to come,1997-Clinton
we must keep our old democracy forever young,1997-Clinton
guided by the ancient vision of a promised land let us set our sights upon a land of new promise,1997-Clinton
the promise of america was born in the 18th century out of the bold conviction that we are all created equal,1997-Clinton
it was extended and preserved in the 19th century when our nation spread across the continent saved the union and abolished the awful scourge of slavery,1997-Clinton
then in turmoil and triumph that promise exploded onto the world stage to make this the american century,1997-Clinton
and what a century it has been,1997-Clinton
america became the world s mightiest industrial power saved the world from tyranny in two world wars and a long cold war and time and again reached out across the globe to millions who like us longed for the blessings of liberty,1997-Clinton
along the way americans produced a great middle class and security in old age built unrivaled centers of learning and opened public schools to all split the atom and explored the heavens invented the computer and the microchip and deepened the wellspring of justice by making a revolution in civil rights for african americans and all minorities and extending the circle of citizenship opportunity and dignity to women,1997-Clinton
now for the third time a new century is upon us and another time to choose,1997-Clinton
we began the 19th century with a choice to spread our nation from coast to coast,1997-Clinton
we began the 20th century with a choice to harness the industrial revolution to our values of free enterprise conservation and human decency,1997-Clinton
those choices made all the difference,1997-Clinton
at the dawn of the 21st century a free people must now choose to shape the forces of the information age and the global society to unleash the limitless potential of all our people and yes to form a more perfect union,1997-Clinton
when last we gathered our march to this new future seemed less certain than it does today,1997-Clinton
we vowed then to set a clear course to renew our nation,1997-Clinton
in these four years we have been touched by tragedy exhilarated by challenge strengthened by achievement,1997-Clinton
america stands alone as the world s indispensable nation,1997-Clinton
once again our economy is the strongest on earth,1997-Clinton
once again we are building stronger families thriving communities better educational opportunities a cleaner environment,1997-Clinton
problems that once seemed destined to deepen now bend to our efforts our streets are safer and record numbers of our fellow citizens have moved from welfare to work,1997-Clinton
and once again we have resolved for our time a great debate over the role of government,1997-Clinton
today we can declare government is not the problem and government is not the solution,1997-Clinton
we the american people we are the solution,1997-Clinton
our founders understood that well and gave us a democracy strong enough to endure for centuries flexible enough to face our common challenges and advance our common dreams in each new day,1997-Clinton
as times change so government must change,1997-Clinton
we need a new government for a new century humble enough not to try to solve all our problems for us but strong enough to give us the tools to solve our problems for ourselves a government that is smaller lives within its means and does more with less,1997-Clinton
yet where it can stand up for our values and interests in the world and where it can give americans the power to make a real difference in their everyday lives government should do more not less,1997-Clinton
the preeminent mission of our new government is to give all americans an opportunity not a guarantee but a real opportunity to build better lives,1997-Clinton
beyond that my fellow citizens the future is up to us,1997-Clinton
our founders taught us that the preservation of our liberty and our union depends upon responsible citizenship,1997-Clinton
and we need a new sense of responsibility for a new century,1997-Clinton
there is work to do work that government alone cannot do teaching children to read hiring people off welfare rolls coming out from behind locked doors and shuttered windows to help reclaim our streets from drugs and gangs and crime taking time out of our own lives to serve others,1997-Clinton
each and every one of us in our own way must assume personal responsibility not only for ourselves and our families but for our neighbors and our nation,1997-Clinton
our greatest responsibility is to embrace a new spirit of community for a new century,1997-Clinton
for any one of us to succeed we must succeed as one america,1997-Clinton
the challenge of our past remains the challenge of our future will we be one nation one people with one common destiny or not,1997-Clinton
will we all come together or come apart,1997-Clinton
the divide of race has been america s constant curse,1997-Clinton
and each new wave of immigrants gives new targets to old prejudices,1997-Clinton
prejudice and contempt cloaked in the pretense of religious or political conviction are no different,1997-Clinton
these forces have nearly destroyed our nation in the past,1997-Clinton
they plague us still,1997-Clinton
they fuel the fanaticism of terror,1997-Clinton
and they torment the lives of millions in fractured nations all around the world,1997-Clinton
these obsessions cripple both those who hate and of course those who are hated robbing both of what they might become,1997-Clinton
we cannot we will not succumb to the dark impulses that lurk in the far regions of the soul everywhere,1997-Clinton
we shall overcome them,1997-Clinton
and we shall replace them with the generous spirit of a people who feel at home with one another,1997-Clinton
our rich texture of racial religious and political diversity will be a godsend in the 21st century,1997-Clinton
great rewards will come to those who can live together learn together work together forge new ties that bind together,1997-Clinton
as this new era approaches we can already see its broad outlines,1997-Clinton
ten years ago the internet was the mystical province of physicists today it is a commonplace encyclopedia for millions of schoolchildren,1997-Clinton
scientists now are decoding the blueprint of human life,1997-Clinton
cures for our most feared illnesses seem close at hand,1997-Clinton
the world is no longer divided into two hostile camps,1997-Clinton
instead now we are building bonds with nations that once were our adversaries,1997-Clinton
growing connections of commerce and culture give us a chance to lift the fortunes and spirits of people the world over,1997-Clinton
and for the very first time in all of history more people on this planet live under democracy than dictatorship,1997-Clinton
my fellow americans as we look back at this remarkable century we may ask can we hope not just to follow but even to surpass the achievements of the 20th century in america and to avoid the awful bloodshed that stained its legacy,1997-Clinton
to that question every american here and every american in our land today must answer a resounding yes,1997-Clinton
this is the heart of our task,1997-Clinton
with a new vision of government a new sense of responsibility a new spirit of community we will sustain america s journey,1997-Clinton
the promise we sought in a new land we will find again in a land of new promise,1997-Clinton
in this new land education will be every citizen s most prized possession,1997-Clinton
our schools will have the highest standards in the world igniting the spark of possibility in the eyes of every girl and every boy,1997-Clinton
and the doors of higher education will be open to all,1997-Clinton
the knowledge and power of the information age will be within reach not just of the few but of every classroom every library every child,1997-Clinton
parents and children will have time not only to work but to read and play together,1997-Clinton
and the plans they make at their kitchen table will be those of a better home a better job the certain chance to go to college,1997-Clinton
our streets will echo again with the laughter of our children because no one will try to shoot them or sell them drugs anymore,1997-Clinton
everyone who can work will work with today s permanent under class part of tomorrow s growing middle class,1997-Clinton
new miracles of medicine at last will reach not only those who can claim care now but the children and hardworking families too long denied,1997-Clinton
we will stand mighty for peace and freedom and maintain a strong defense against terror and destruction,1997-Clinton
our children will sleep free from the threat of nuclear chemical or biological weapons,1997-Clinton
ports and airports farms and factories will thrive with trade and innovation and ideas,1997-Clinton
and the world s greatest democracy will lead a whole world of democracies,1997-Clinton
our land of new promise will be a nation that meets its obligations a nation that balances its budget but never loses the balance of its values,1997-Clinton
a nation where our grandparents have secure retirement and health care and their grandchildren know we have made the reforms necessary to sustain those benefits for their time,1997-Clinton
a nation that fortifies the world s most productive economy even as it protects the great natural bounty of our water air and majestic land,1997-Clinton
and in this land of new promise we will have reformed our politics so that the voice of the people will always speak louder than the din of narrow interests regaining the participation and deserving the trust of all americans,1997-Clinton
fellow citizens let us build that america a nation ever moving forward toward realizing the full potential of all its citizens,1997-Clinton
prosperity and power yes they are important and we must maintain them,1997-Clinton
but let us never forget the greatest progress we have made and the greatest progress we have yet to make is in the human heart,1997-Clinton
in the end all the world s wealth and a thousand armies are no match for the strength and decency of the human spirit,1997-Clinton
thirty four years ago the man whose life we celebrate today spoke to us down there at the other end of this mall in words that moved the conscience of a nation,1997-Clinton
like a prophet of old he told of his dream that one day america would rise up and treat all its citizens as equals before the law and in the heart,1997-Clinton
martin luther king s dream was the american dream,1997-Clinton
his quest is our quest the ceaseless striving to live out our true creed,1997-Clinton
our history has been built on such dreams and labors,1997-Clinton
and by our dreams and labors we will redeem the promise of america in the 21st century,1997-Clinton
to that effort i pledge all my strength and every power of my office,1997-Clinton
i ask the members of congress here to join in that pledge,1997-Clinton
the american people returned to office a president of one party and a congress of another,1997-Clinton
surely they did not do this to advance the politics of petty bickering and extreme partisanship they plainly deplore,1997-Clinton
no they call on us instead to be repairers of the breach and to move on with america s mission,1997-Clinton
america demands and deserves big things from us and nothing big ever came from being small,1997-Clinton
let us remember the timeless wisdom of cardinal bernardin when facing the end of his own life,1997-Clinton
he said it is wrong to waste the precious gift of time on acrimony and division,1997-Clinton
fellow citizens we must not waste the precious gift of this time,1997-Clinton
for all of us are on that same journey of our lives and our journey too will come to an end,1997-Clinton
but the journey of our america must go on,1997-Clinton
and so my fellow americans we must be strong for there is much to dare,1997-Clinton
the demands of our time are great and they are different,1997-Clinton
let us meet them with faith and courage with patience and a grateful and happy heart,1997-Clinton
let us shape the hope of this day into the noblest chapter in our history,1997-Clinton
yes let us build our bridge,1997-Clinton
a bridge wide enough and strong enough for every american to cross over to a blessed land of new promise,1997-Clinton
may those generations whose faces we cannot yet see whose names we may never know say of us here that we led our beloved land into a new century with the american dream alive for all her children with the american promise of a more perfect union a reality for all her people with america s bright flame of freedom spreading throughout all the world,1997-Clinton
from the height of this place and the summit of this century let us go forth,1997-Clinton
may god strengthen our hands for the good work ahead and always always bless our america,1997-Clinton
president clinton distinguished guests and my fellow citizens the peaceful transfer of authority is rare in history yet common in our country,2001-Bush
with a simple oath we affirm old traditions and make new beginnings,2001-Bush
as i begin i thank president clinton for his service to our nation,2001-Bush
and i thank vice president gore for a contest conducted with spirit and ended with grace,2001-Bush
i am honored and humbled to stand here where so many of america s leaders have come before me and so many will follow,2001-Bush
we have a place all of us in a long story a story we continue but whose end we will not see,2001-Bush
it is the story of a new world that became a friend and liberator of the old a story of a slave holding society that became a servant of freedom the story of a power that went into the world to protect but not possess to defend but not to conquer,2001-Bush
it is the american story a story of flawed and fallible people united across the generations by grand and enduring ideals,2001-Bush
the grandest of these ideals is an unfolding american promise that everyone belongs that everyone deserves a chance that no insignificant person was ever born,2001-Bush
americans are called to enact this promise in our lives and in our laws,2001-Bush
and though our nation has sometimes halted and sometimes delayed we must follow no other course,2001-Bush
through much of the last century america s faith in freedom and democracy was a rock in a raging sea,2001-Bush
now it is a seed upon the wind taking root in many nations,2001-Bush
our democratic faith is more than the creed of our country it is the inborn hope of our humanity an ideal we carry but do not own a trust we bear and pass along,2001-Bush
and even after nearly 225 years we have a long way yet to travel,2001-Bush
while many of our citizens prosper others doubt the promise even the justice of our own country,2001-Bush
the ambitions of some americans are limited by failing schools and hidden prejudice and the circumstances of their birth,2001-Bush
and sometimes our differences run so deep it seems we share a continent but not a country,2001-Bush
we do not accept this and we will not allow it,2001-Bush
our unity our union is the serious work of leaders and citizens in every generation,2001-Bush
and this is my solemn pledge i will work to build a single nation of justice and opportunity,2001-Bush
i know this is in our reach because we are guided by a power larger than ourselves who creates us equal in his image,2001-Bush
and we are confident in principles that unite and lead us onward,2001-Bush
america has never been united by blood or birth or soil,2001-Bush
we are bound by ideals that move us beyond our backgrounds lift us above our interests and teach us what it means to be citizens,2001-Bush
every child must be taught these principles,2001-Bush
every citizen must uphold them,2001-Bush
and every immigrant by embracing these ideals makes our country more not less american,2001-Bush
today we affirm a new commitment to live out our nation s promise through civility courage compassion and character,2001-Bush
america at its best matches a commitment to principle with a concern for civility,2001-Bush
a civil society demands from each of us good will and respect fair dealing and forgiveness,2001-Bush
some seem to believe that our politics can afford to be petty because in a time of peace the stakes of our debates appear small,2001-Bush
but the stakes for america are never small,2001-Bush
if our country does not lead the cause of freedom it will not be led,2001-Bush
if we do not turn the hearts of children toward knowledge and character we will lose their gifts and undermine their idealism,2001-Bush
if we permit our economy to drift and decline the vulnerable will suffer most,2001-Bush
we must live up to the calling we share,2001-Bush
civility is not a tactic or a sentiment,2001-Bush
it is the determined choice of trust over cynicism of community over chaos,2001-Bush
and this commitment if we keep it is a way to shared accomplishment,2001-Bush
america at its best is also courageous,2001-Bush
our national courage has been clear in times of depression and war when defending common dangers defined our common good,2001-Bush
now we must choose if the example of our fathers and mothers will inspire us or condemn us,2001-Bush
we must show courage in a time of blessing by confronting problems instead of passing them on to future generations,2001-Bush
together we will reclaim america s schools before ignorance and apathy claim more young lives,2001-Bush
we will reform social security and medicare sparing our children from struggles we have the power to prevent,2001-Bush
and we will reduce taxes to recover the momentum of our economy and reward the effort and enterprise of working americans,2001-Bush
we will build our defenses beyond challenge lest weakness invite challenge,2001-Bush
we will confront weapons of mass destruction so that a new century is spared new horrors,2001-Bush
the enemies of liberty and our country should make no mistake america remains engaged in the world by history and by choice shaping a balance of power that favors freedom,2001-Bush
we will defend our allies and our interests,2001-Bush
we will show purpose without arrogance,2001-Bush
we will meet aggression and bad faith with resolve and strength,2001-Bush
and to all nations we will speak for the values that gave our nation birth,2001-Bush
america at its best is compassionate,2001-Bush
in the quiet of american conscience we know that deep persistent poverty is unworthy of our nation s promise,2001-Bush
and whatever our views of its cause we can agree that children at risk are not at fault,2001-Bush
abandonment and abuse are not acts of god they are failures of love,2001-Bush
and the proliferation of prisons however necessary is no substitute for hope and order in our souls,2001-Bush
where there is suffering there is duty,2001-Bush
americans in need are not strangers they are citizens not problems but priorities,2001-Bush
and all of us are diminished when any are hopeless,2001-Bush
government has great responsibilities for public safety and public health for civil rights and common schools,2001-Bush
yet compassion is the work of a nation not just a government,2001-Bush
and some needs and hurts are so deep they will only respond to a mentor s touch or a pastor s prayer,2001-Bush
church and charity synagogue and mosque lend our communities their humanity and they will have an honored place in our plans and in our laws,2001-Bush
many in our country do not know the pain of poverty but we can listen to those who do,2001-Bush
and i can pledge our nation to a goal when we see that wounded traveler on the road to jericho we will not pass to the other side,2001-Bush
america at its best is a place where personal responsibility is valued and expected,2001-Bush
encouraging responsibility is not a search for scapegoats it is a call to conscience,2001-Bush
and though it requires sacrifice it brings a deeper fulfillment,2001-Bush
we find the fullness of life not only in options but in commitments,2001-Bush
and we find that children and community are the commitments that set us free,2001-Bush
our public interest depends on private character on civic duty and family bonds and basic fairness on uncounted unhonored acts of decency which give direction to our freedom,2001-Bush
sometimes in life we are called to do great things,2001-Bush
but as a saint of our times has said every day we are called to do small things with great love,2001-Bush
the most important tasks of a democracy are done by everyone,2001-Bush
i will live and lead by these principles to advance my convictions with civility to pursue the public interest with courage to speak for greater justice and compassion to call for responsibility and try to live it as well,2001-Bush
in all these ways i will bring the values of our history to the care of our times,2001-Bush
what you do is as important as anything government does,2001-Bush
i ask you to seek a common good beyond your comfort to defend needed reforms against easy attacks to serve your nation beginning with your neighbor,2001-Bush
i ask you to be citizens citizens not spectators citizens not subjects responsible citizens building communities of service and a nation of character,2001-Bush
americans are generous and strong and decent not because we believe in ourselves but because we hold beliefs beyond ourselves,2001-Bush
when this spirit of citizenship is missing no government program can replace it,2001-Bush
when this spirit is present no wrong can stand against it,2001-Bush
after the declaration of independence was signed virginia statesman john page wrote to thomas jefferson we know the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong,2001-Bush
do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm,2001-Bush
much time has passed since jefferson arrived for his inauguration,2001-Bush
the years and changes accumulate,2001-Bush
but the themes of this day he would know our nation s grand story of courage and its simple dream of dignity,2001-Bush
we are not this story s author who fills time and eternity with his purpose,2001-Bush
yet his purpose is achieved in our duty and our duty is fulfilled in service to one another,2001-Bush
never tiring never yielding never finishing we renew that purpose today to make our country more just and generous to affirm the dignity of our lives and every life,2001-Bush
this work continues,2001-Bush
this story goes on,2001-Bush
and an angel still rides in the whirlwind and directs this storm,2001-Bush
god bless you all and god bless america,2001-Bush
vice president cheney mr chief justice president carter president bush president clinton members of the united states congress reverend clergy distinguished guests fellow citizens on this day prescribed by law and marked by ceremony we celebrate the durable wisdom of our constitution and recall the deep commitments that unite our country,2005-Bush
i am grateful for the honor of this hour mindful of the consequential times in which we live and determined to fulfill the oath that i have sworn and you have witnessed,2005-Bush
at this second gathering our duties are defined not by the words i use but by the history we have seen together,2005-Bush
for a half a century america defended our own freedom by standing watch on distant borders,2005-Bush
after the shipwreck of communism came years of relative quiet years of repose years of sabbatical ¡ xand then there came a day of fire,2005-Bush
we have seen our vulnerability ¡ xand we have seen its deepest source,2005-Bush
for as long as whole regions of the world simmer in resentment and tyranny ¡ xprone to ideologies that feed hatred and excuse murder ¡ xviolence will gather and multiply in destructive power and cross the most defended borders and raise a mortal threat,2005-Bush
there is only one force of history that can break the reign of hatred and resentment and expose the pretensions of tyrants and reward the hopes of the decent and tolerant and that is the force of human freedom,2005-Bush
we are led by events and common sense to one conclusion the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands,2005-Bush
the best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world,2005-Bush
america ¡¦ s vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one,2005-Bush
from the day of our founding we have proclaimed that every man and woman on this earth has rights and dignity and matchless value because they bear the image of the maker of heaven and earth,2005-Bush
across the generations we have proclaimed the imperative of self government because no one is fit to be a master and no one deserves to be a slave,2005-Bush
advancing these ideals is the mission that created our nation,2005-Bush
it is the honorable achievement of our fathers,2005-Bush
now it is the urgent requirement of our nation ¡¦ s security and the calling of our time,2005-Bush
so it is the policy of the united states to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world,2005-Bush
this is not primarily the task of arms though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary,2005-Bush
freedom by its nature must be chosen and defended by citizens and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities,2005-Bush
and when the soul of a nation finally speaks the institutions that arise may reflect customs and traditions very different from our own,2005-Bush
america will not impose our own style of government on the unwilling,2005-Bush
our goal instead is to help others find their own voice attain their own freedom and make their own way,2005-Bush
the great objective of ending tyranny is the concentrated work of generations,2005-Bush
the difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it,2005-Bush
america ¡¦ s influence is not unlimited but fortunately for the oppressed america ¡¦ s influence is considerable and we will use it confidently in freedom ¡¦ s cause,2005-Bush
my most solemn duty is to protect this nation and its people from further attacks and emerging threats,2005-Bush
some have unwisely chosen to test america ¡¦ s resolve and have found it firm,2005-Bush
we will persistently clarify the choice before every ruler and every nation the moral choice between oppression which is always wrong and freedom which is eternally right,2005-Bush
america will not pretend that jailed dissidents prefer their chains or that women welcome humiliation and servitude or that any human being aspires to live at the mercy of bullies,2005-Bush
we will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people,2005-Bush
america ¡¦ s belief in human dignity will guide our policies yet rights must be more than the grudging concessions of dictators they are secured by free dissent and the participation of the governed,2005-Bush
in the long run there is no justice without freedom and there can be no human rights without human liberty,2005-Bush
some i know have questioned the global appeal of liberty ¡ xthough this time in history four decades defined by the swiftest advance of freedom ever seen is an odd time for doubt,2005-Bush
americans of all people should never be surprised by the power of our ideals,2005-Bush
eventually the call of freedom comes to every mind and every soul,2005-Bush
we do not accept the existence of permanent tyranny because we do not accept the possibility of permanent slavery,2005-Bush
liberty will come to those who love it,2005-Bush
today america speaks anew to the peoples of the world all who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know the united states will not ignore your oppression or excuse your oppressors,2005-Bush
when you stand for your liberty we will stand with you,2005-Bush
democratic reformers facing repression prison or exile can know america sees you for who you are the future leaders of your free country,2005-Bush
the rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as abraham lincoln did ¡§ those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under the rule of a just god cannot long retain it the leaders of governments with long habits of control need to know to serve your people you must learn to trust them,2005-Bush
start on this journey of progress and justice and america will walk at your side,2005-Bush
and all the allies of the united states can know we honor your friendship we rely on your counsel and we depend on your help,2005-Bush
division among free nations is a primary goal of freedom ¡¦ s enemies,2005-Bush
the concerted effort of free nations to promote democracy is a prelude to our enemies ¡¦ defeat,2005-Bush
today i also speak anew to my fellow citizens from all of you i have asked patience in the hard task of securing america which you have granted in good measure,2005-Bush
our country has accepted obligations that are difficult to fulfill and would be dishonorable to abandon,2005-Bush
yet because we have acted in the great liberating tradition of this nation tens of millions have achieved their freedom,2005-Bush
and as hope kindles hope millions more will find it,2005-Bush
by our efforts we have lit a fire as well ¡ xa fire in the minds of men,2005-Bush
it warms those who feel its power it burns those who fight its progress and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world,2005-Bush
a few americans have accepted the hardest duties in this cause ¡ xin the quiet work of intelligence and diplomacy ¡ k the idealistic work of helping raise up free governments ¡ k the dangerous and necessary work of fighting our enemies,2005-Bush
some have shown their devotion to our country in deaths that honored their whole lives ¡ xand we will always honor their names and their sacrifice,2005-Bush
all americans have witnessed this idealism and some for the first time,2005-Bush
i ask our youngest citizens to believe the evidence of your eyes,2005-Bush
you have seen duty and allegiance in the determined faces of our soldiers,2005-Bush
you have seen that life is fragile and evil is real and courage triumphs,2005-Bush
make the choice to serve in a cause larger than your wants larger than yourself ¡ xand in your days you will add not just to the wealth of our country but to its character,2005-Bush
america has need of idealism and courage because we have essential work at home ¡ xthe unfinished work of american freedom,2005-Bush
in a world moving toward liberty we are determined to show the meaning and promise of liberty,2005-Bush
in america ¡¦ s ideal of freedom citizens find the dignity and security of economic independence instead of laboring on the edge of subsistence,2005-Bush
this is the broader definition of liberty that motivated the homestead act the social security act and the g i,2005-Bush
bill of rights,2005-Bush
and now we will extend this vision by reforming great institutions to serve the needs of our time,2005-Bush
to give every american a stake in the promise and future of our country we will bring the highest standards to our schools and build an ownership society,2005-Bush
we will widen the ownership of homes and businesses retirement savings and health insurance ¡ xpreparing our people for the challenges of life in a free society,2005-Bush
by making every citizen an agent of his or her own destiny we will give our fellow americans greater freedom from want and fear and make our society more prosperous and just and equal,2005-Bush
in america ¡¦ s ideal of freedom the public interest depends on private character ¡ xon integrity and tolerance toward others and the rule of conscience in our own lives,2005-Bush
self government relies in the end on the governing of the self,2005-Bush
that edifice of character is built in families supported by communities with standards and sustained in our national life by the truths of sinai the sermon on the mount the words of the koran and the varied faiths of our people,2005-Bush
americans move forward in every generation by reaffirming all that is good and true that came before ¡ xideals of justice and conduct that are the same yesterday today and forever,2005-Bush
in america ¡¦ s ideal of freedom the exercise of rights is ennobled by service and mercy and a heart for the weak,2005-Bush
liberty for all does not mean independence from one another,2005-Bush
our nation relies on men and women who look after a neighbor and surround the lost with love,2005-Bush
americans at our best value the life we see in one another and must always remember that even the unwanted have worth,2005-Bush
and our country must abandon all the habits of racism because we cannot carry the message of freedom and the baggage of bigotry at the same time,2005-Bush
from the perspective of a single day including this day of dedication the issues and questions before our country are many,2005-Bush
from the viewpoint of centuries the questions that come to us are narrowed and few,2005-Bush
did our generation advance the cause of freedom,2005-Bush
and did our character bring credit to that cause,2005-Bush
these questions that judge us also unite us because americans of every party and background americans by choice and by birth are bound to one another in the cause of freedom,2005-Bush
we have known divisions which must be healed to move forward in great purposes ¡ xand i will strive in good faith to heal them,2005-Bush
yet those divisions do not define america,2005-Bush
we felt the unity and fellowship of our nation when freedom came under attack and our response came like a single hand over a single heart,2005-Bush
and we can feel that same unity and pride whenever america acts for good and the victims of disaster are given hope and the unjust encounter justice and the captives are set free,2005-Bush
we go forward with complete confidence in the eventual triumph of freedom,2005-Bush
not because history runs on the wheels of inevitability it is human choices that move events,2005-Bush
not because we consider ourselves a chosen nation god moves and chooses as he wills,2005-Bush
we have confidence because freedom is the permanent hope of mankind the hunger in dark places the longing of the soul,2005-Bush
when our founders declared a new order of the ages when soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty when citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner ¡§ freedom now ¡¨¡ xthey were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled,2005-Bush
history has an ebb and flow of justice but history also has a visible direction set by liberty and the author of liberty,2005-Bush
when the declaration of independence was first read in public and the liberty bell was sounded in celebration a witness said ¡§ it rang as if it meant something in our time it means something still,2005-Bush
america in this young century proclaims liberty throughout all the world and to all the inhabitants thereof,2005-Bush
renewed in our strength ¡ xtested but not weary ¡ xwe are ready for the greatest achievements in the history of freedom,2005-Bush
may god bless you and may he watch over the united states of america,2005-Bush
my fellow citizens,2009-Obama
i stand here today humbled by the task before us grateful for the trust you have bestowed mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors,2009-Obama
i thank president bush for his service to our nation as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition,2009-Obama
forty four americans have now taken the presidential oath,2009-Obama
the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace,2009-Obama
yet every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms,2009-Obama
at these moments america has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers and true to our founding documents,2009-Obama
so it has been,2009-Obama
so it must be with this generation of americans,2009-Obama
that we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood,2009-Obama
our nation is at war against a far reaching network of violence and hatred,2009-Obama
our economy is badly weakened a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age,2009-Obama
homes have been lost jobs shed businesses shuttered,2009-Obama
our health care is too costly our schools fail too many and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet,2009-Obama
these are the indicators of crisis subject to data and statistics,2009-Obama
less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land a nagging fear that america s decline is inevitable that the next generation must lower its sights,2009-Obama
today i say to you that the challenges we face are real,2009-Obama
they are serious and they are many,2009-Obama
they will not be met easily or in a short span of time,2009-Obama
but know this america they will be met,2009-Obama
on this day we gather because we have chosen hope over fear unity of purpose over conflict and discord,2009-Obama
on this day we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises the recriminations and worn out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics,2009-Obama
we remain a young nation but in the words of scripture the time has come to set aside childish things,2009-Obama
the time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit to choose our better history to carry forward that precious gift that noble idea passed on from generation to generation the god given promise that all are equal all are free and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness,2009-Obama
in reaffirming the greatness of our nation we understand that greatness is never a given,2009-Obama
it must be earned,2009-Obama
our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less,2009-Obama
it has not been the path for the faint hearted for those who prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame,2009-Obama
rather it has been the risk takers the doers the makers of things some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor who have carried us up the long rugged path towards prosperity and freedom,2009-Obama
for us they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life,2009-Obama
for us they toiled in sweatshops and settled the west endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth,2009-Obama
for us they fought and died in places like concord and gettysburg normandy and khe sahn,2009-Obama
time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life,2009-Obama
they saw america as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction,2009-Obama
this is the journey we continue today,2009-Obama
we remain the most prosperous powerful nation on earth,2009-Obama
our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began,2009-Obama
our minds are no less inventive our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year,2009-Obama
our capacity remains undiminished,2009-Obama
but our time of standing pat of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions that time has surely passed,2009-Obama
starting today we must pick ourselves up dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking america,2009-Obama
for everywhere we look there is work to be done,2009-Obama
the state of our economy calls for action bold and swift and we will act not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth,2009-Obama
we will build the roads and bridges the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together,2009-Obama
we will restore science to its rightful place and wield technology s wonders to raise health care s quality and lower its cost,2009-Obama

and we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age,2009-Obama
all this we can do,2009-Obama
all this we will do,2009-Obama
now there are some who question the scale of our ambitions who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans,2009-Obama
their memories are short,2009-Obama
for they have forgotten what this country has already done what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage,2009-Obama
what the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply,2009-Obama
the question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small but whether it works whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage care they can afford a retirement that is dignified,2009-Obama
where the answer is yes we intend to move forward,2009-Obama
where the answer is no programs will end,2009-Obama
and those of us who manage the public s dollars will be held to account to spend wisely reform bad habits and do our business in the light of day because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government,2009-Obama
nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye the market can spin out of control the nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous,2009-Obama
the success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our gross domestic product but on the reach of our prosperity on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart not out of charity but because it is the surest route to our common good,2009-Obama
as for our common defense we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals,2009-Obama
our founding fathers faced with perils that we can scarcely imagine drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man a charter expanded by the blood of generations,2009-Obama
those ideals still light the world and we will not give them up for expedience s sake,2009-Obama
and so to all the other peoples and governments who are watching today from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born know that america is a friend of each nation and every man woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity and we are ready to lead once more,2009-Obama
recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions,2009-Obama
they understood that our power alone cannot protect us nor does it entitle us to do as we please,2009-Obama
instead they knew that our power grows through its prudent use our security emanates from the justness of our cause the force of our example the tempering qualities of humility and restraint,2009-Obama
we are the keepers of this legacy,2009-Obama
guided by these principles once more we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort even greater cooperation and understanding between nations,2009-Obama
we will begin to responsibly leave iraq to its people and forge a hard earned peace in afghanistan,2009-Obama
with old friends and former foes we will work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet,2009-Obama
we will not apologize for our way of life nor will we waver in its defense and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken you cannot outlast us and we will defeat you,2009-Obama
for we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength not a weakness,2009-Obama
we are a nation of christians and muslims jews and hindus and non believers,2009-Obama
we are shaped by every language and culture drawn from every end of this earth and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve that as the world grows smaller our common humanity shall reveal itself and that america must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace,2009-Obama
to the muslim world we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect,2009-Obama
to those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their society s ills on the west know that your people will judge you on what you can build not what you destroy,2009-Obama
to those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent know that you are on the wrong side of history but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist,2009-Obama
to the people of poor nations we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds,2009-Obama
and to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders nor can we consume the world s resources without regard to effect,2009-Obama
for the world has changed and we must change with it,2009-Obama
as we consider the road that unfolds before us we remember with humble gratitude those brave americans who at this very hour patrol far off deserts and distant mountains,2009-Obama
they have something to tell us just as the fallen heroes who lie in arlington whisper through the ages,2009-Obama
we honor them not only because they are the guardians of our liberty but because they embody the spirit of service a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves,2009-Obama
and yet at this moment a moment that will define a generation it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all,2009-Obama
for as much as government can do and must do it is ultimately the faith and determination of the american people upon which this nation relies,2009-Obama
it is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours,2009-Obama
it is the firefighter s courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a parent s willingness to nurture a child that finally decides our fate,2009-Obama
our challenges may be new,2009-Obama
the instruments with which we meet them may be new,2009-Obama
but those values upon which our success depends honesty and hard work courage and fair play tolerance and curiosity loyalty and patriotism these things are old,2009-Obama
these things are true,2009-Obama
they have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history,2009-Obama
what is demanded then is a return to these truths,2009-Obama
what is required of us now is a new era of responsibility a recognition on the part of every american that we have duties to ourselves our nation and the world duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit so defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task,2009-Obama
this is the price and the promise of citizenship,2009-Obama
this is the source of our confidence the knowledge that god calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny,2009-Obama
this is the meaning of our liberty and our creed why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath,2009-Obama
so let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled,2009-Obama
in the year of america s birth in the coldest of months a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river,2009-Obama
the capital was abandoned,2009-Obama
the enemy was advancing,2009-Obama
the snow was stained with blood,2009-Obama
at a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people,2009-Obama
let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter when nothing but hope and virtue could survive that the city and the country alarmed at one common danger came forth to meet,2009-Obama
it,2009-Obama
america,2009-Obama
in the face of our common dangers in this winter of our hardship let us remember these timeless words,2009-Obama
with hope and virtue let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come,2009-Obama
let it be said by our children s children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end that we did not turn back nor did we falter and with eyes fixed on the horizon and god s grace upon us we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations,2009-Obama
thank you,2009-Obama
god bless you,2009-Obama
and god bless the united states of america,2009-Obama
