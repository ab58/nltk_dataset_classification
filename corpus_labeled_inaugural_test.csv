Utterance,Label
in this conflict of emotions all i dare aver is that it has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every circumstance by which it might be affected,1789-Washington
every step by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation seems to have been distinguished by some token of providential agency and in the important revolution just accomplished in the system of their united government the tranquil deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities from which the event has resulted can not be compared with the means by which most governments have been established without some return of pious gratitude along with an humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage,1789-Washington
it will be more consistent with those circumstances and far more congenial with the feelings which actuate me to substitute in place of a recommendation of particular measures the tribute that is due to the talents the rectitude and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise and adopt them,1789-Washington
to the foregoing observations i have one to add which will be most properly addressed to the house of representatives,1789-Washington
fellow citizens i am again called upon by the voice of my country to execute the functions of its chief magistrate,1793-Washington
relying however on the purity of their intentions the justice of their cause and the integrity and intelligence of the people under an overruling providence which had so signally protected this country from the first the representatives of this nation then consisting of little more than half its present number not only broke to pieces the chains which were forging and the rod of iron that was lifted up but frankly cut asunder the ties which had bound them and launched into an ocean of uncertainty,1797-Adams
in this dangerous crisis the people of america were not abandoned by their usual good sense presence of mind resolution or integrity,1797-Adams
in its general principles and great outlines it was conformable to such a system of government as i had ever most esteemed and in some states my own native state in particular had contributed to establish,1797-Adams
the operation of it has equaled the most sanguine expectations of its friends and from an habitual attention to it satisfaction in its administration and delight in its effects upon the peace order prosperity and happiness of the nation i have acquired an habitual attachment to it and veneration for it,1797-Adams
for it is the people only that are represented,1797-Adams
in the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free fair virtuous and independent elections,1797-Adams
in that retirement which is his voluntary choice may he long live to enjoy the delicious recollection of his services the gratitude of mankind the happy fruits of them to himself and the world which are daily increasing and that splendid prospect of the future fortunes of this country which is opening from year to year,1797-Adams
and may that being who is supreme over all the patron of order the fountain of justice and the protector in all ages of the world of virtuous liberty continue his blessing upon this nation and its government and give it all possible success and duration consistent with the ends of his providence,1797-Adams
to you then gentlemen who are charged with the sovereign functions of legislation and to those associated with you i look with encouragement for that guidance and support which may enable us to steer with safety the vessel in which we are all embarked amidst the conflicting elements of a troubled world,1801-Jefferson
and let us reflect that having banished from our land that religious intolerance under which mankind so long bled and suffered we have yet gained little if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic as wicked and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions,1801-Jefferson
if there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican form let them stand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it,1801-Jefferson
sometimes it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself,1801-Jefferson
kindly separated by nature and a wide ocean from the exterminating havoc of one quarter of the globe too high minded to endure the degradations of the others possessing a chosen country with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and thousandth generation entertaining a due sense of our equal right to the use of our own faculties to the acquisitions of our own industry to honor and confidence from our fellow citizens resulting not from birth but from our actions and their sense of them enlightened by a benign religion professed indeed and practiced in various forms yet all of them inculcating honesty truth temperance gratitude and the love of man acknowledging and adoring an overruling providence which by all its dispensations proves that it delights in the happiness of man here and his greater happiness hereafter with all these blessings what more is necessary to make us a happy and a prosperous people,1801-Jefferson
equal and exact justice to all men of whatever state or persuasion religious or political peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances with none the support of the state governments in all their rights as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns and the surest bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies the preservation of the general government in its whole constitutional vigor as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad a jealous care of the right of election by the people a mild and safe corrective of abuses which are lopped by the sword of revolution where peaceable remedies are unprovided absolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority the vital principle of republics from which is no appeal but to force the vital principle and immediate parent of despotism a well disciplined militia our best reliance in peace and for the first moments of war till regulars may relieve them the supremacy of the civil over the military authority economy in the public expense that labor may be lightly burthened the honest payment of our debts and sacred preservation of the public faith encouragement of agriculture and of commerce as its handmaid the diffusion of information and arraignment of all abuses at the bar of the public reason freedom of religion freedom of the press and freedom of person under the protection of the habeas corpus and trial by juries impartially selected,1801-Jefferson
with experience enough in subordinate offices to have seen the difficulties of this the greatest of all i have learnt to expect that it will rarely fall to the lot of imperfect man to retire from this station with the reputation and the favor which bring him into it,1801-Jefferson
the approbation implied by your suffrage is a great consolation to me for the past and my future solicitude will be to retain the good opinion of those who have bestowed it in advance to conciliate that of others by doing them all the good in my power and to be instrumental to the happiness and freedom of all,1801-Jefferson
my conscience tells me i have on every occasion acted up to that declaration according to its obvious import and to the understanding of every candid mind,1805-Jefferson
the suppression of unnecessary offices of useless establishments and expenses enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes,1805-Jefferson
in time of war if injustice by ourselves or others must sometimes produce war increased as the same revenue will be by increased population and consumption and aided by other resources reserved for that crisis it may meet within the year all the expenses of the year without encroaching on the rights of future generations by burthening them with the debts of the past,1805-Jefferson
the larger our association the less will it be shaken by local passions and in any view is it not better that the opposite bank of the mississippi should be settled by our own brethren and children than by strangers of another family,1805-Jefferson
endowed with the faculties and the rights of men breathing an ardent love of liberty and independence and occupying a country which left them no desire but to be undisturbed the stream of overflowing population from other regions directed itself on these shores without power to divert or habits to contend against it they have been overwhelmed by the current or driven before it now reduced within limits too narrow for the hunter s state humanity enjoins us to teach them agriculture and the domestic arts to encourage them to that industry which alone can enable them to maintain their place in existence and to prepare them in time for that state of society which to bodily comforts adds the improvement of the mind and morals,1805-Jefferson
that is due in the first place to the reflecting character of our citizens at large who by the weight of public opinion influence and strengthen the public measures,1805-Jefferson
they might indeed have been corrected by the wholesome punishments reserved to and provided by the laws of the several states against falsehood and defamation but public duties more urgent press on the time of public servants and the offenders have therefore been left to find their punishment in the public indignation,1805-Jefferson
contemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so generally as auguring harmony and happiness to our future course i offer to our country sincere congratulations,1805-Jefferson
i fear not that any motives of interest may lead me astray i am sensible of no passion which could seduce me knowingly from the path of justice but the weaknesses of human nature and the limits of my own understanding will produce errors of judgment sometimes injurious to your interests,1805-Jefferson
under the various circumstances which give peculiar solemnity to the existing period i feel that both the honor and the responsibility allotted to me are inexpressibly enhanced,1809-Madison
it is a precious reflection that the transition from this prosperous condition of our country to the scene which has for some time been distressing us is not chargeable on any unwarrantable views nor as i trust on any involuntary errors in the public councils,1809-Madison
how long their arbitrary edicts will be continued in spite of the demonstrations that not even a pretext for them has been given by the united states and of the fair and liberal attempt to induce a revocation of them can not be anticipated,1809-Madison
of those of my immediate predecessor it might least become me here to speak,1809-Madison
the impressions on me are strengthened by such an evidence that my faithful endeavors to discharge my arduous duties have been favorably estimated and by a consideration of the momentous period at which the trust has been renewed,1813-Madison
not to contend for such a stake is to surrender our equality with other powers on the element common to all and to violate the sacred title which every member of the society has to its protection,1813-Madison
how little has been the effect of this example on the conduct of the enemy,1813-Madison
and what was never before seen british commanders have extorted victory over the unconquerable valor of our troops by presenting to the sympathy of their chief captives awaiting massacre from their savage associates,1813-Madison
still more precise advances were repeated and have been received in a spirit forbidding every reliance not placed on the military resources of the nation,1813-Madison
a general prosperity is visible in the public countenance,1813-Madison
already have the gallant exploits of our naval heroes proved to the world our inherent capacity to maintain our rights on one element,1813-Madison
conscious of my own deficiency i cannot enter on these duties without great anxiety for the result,1817-Monroe
from the commencement of our revolution to the present day almost forty years have elapsed and from the establishment of this constitution twenty eight,1817-Monroe
their citizens individually have been happy and the nation prosperous,1817-Monroe
who restrained from offering his vows in the mode which he prefers to the divine author of his being,1817-Monroe
destructive wars ensued which have of late only been terminated,1817-Monroe
such then is the happy government under which we live a government adequate to every purpose for which the social compact is formed a government elective in all its branches under which every citizen may by his merit obtain the highest trust recognized by the constitution which contains within it no cause of discord none to put at variance one portion of the community with another a government which protects every citizen in the full enjoyment of his rights and is able to protect the nation against injustice from foreign powers,1817-Monroe
blessed too with a fertile soil our produce has always been very abundant leaving even in years the least favorable a surplus for the wants of our fellow men in other countries,1817-Monroe
our manufactures find a generous encouragement by the policy which patronizes domestic industry and the surplus of our produce a steady and profitable market by local wants in less favored parts at home,1817-Monroe
how did we accomplish the revolution,1817-Monroe
had the people of the united states been educated in different principles had they been less intelligent less independent or less virtuous can it be believed that we should have maintained the same steady and consistent career or been blessed with the same success,1817-Monroe
the people themselves become the willing instruments of their own debasement and ruin,1817-Monroe
our distance from europe and the just moderate and pacific policy of our government may form some security against these dangers but they ought to be anticipated and guarded against,1817-Monroe
a people who fail to do it can scarcely be said to hold a place among independent nations,1817-Monroe
to put our extensive coast in such a state of defense as to secure our cities and interior from invasion will be attended with expense but the work when finished will be permanent and it is fair to presume that a single campaign of invasion by a naval force superior to our own aided by a few thousand land troops would expose us to greater expense without taking into the estimate the loss of property and distress of our citizens than would be sufficient for this great work,1817-Monroe
invasions may be made too formidable to be resisted by any land and naval force which it would comport either with the principles of our government or the circumstances of the united states to maintain,1817-Monroe
it is the crisis which makes the pressure and not the laws which provide a remedy for it,1817-Monroe
by thus facilitating the intercourse between the states we shall add much to the convenience and comfort of our fellow citizens much to the ornament of the country and what is of greater importance we shall shorten distances and by making each part more accessible to and dependent on the other we shall bind the union more closely together,1817-Monroe
while we are thus dependent the sudden event of war unsought and unexpected can not fail to plunge us into the most serious difficulties it is important too that the capital which nourishes our manufacturers should be domestic as its influence in that case instead of exhausting as it may do in foreign hands would be felt advantageously on agriculture and every other branch of industry equally important is it to provide at home a market for our raw materials as by extending the competition it will enhance the price and protect the cultivator against the casualties incident to foreign markets,1817-Monroe
these resources besides accomplishing every other necessary purpose put it completely in the power of the united states to discharge the national debt at an early period,1817-Monroe
to meet the requisite responsibility every facility should be afforded to the executive to enable it to bring the public agents intrusted with the public money strictly and promptly to account,1817-Monroe
it is particularly gratifying to me to enter on the discharge of these duties at a time when the united states are blessed with peace,1817-Monroe
union is recommended as well by the free and benign principles of our government extending its blessings to every individual as by the other eminent advantages attending it,1817-Monroe
to promote this harmony in accord with the principles of our republican government and in a manner to give them the most complete effect and to advance in all other respects the best interests of our union will be the object of my constant and zealous exertions,1817-Monroe
in the administrations of the illustrious men who have preceded me in this high station with some of whom i have been connected by the closest ties from early life examples are presented which will always be found highly instructive and useful to their successors,1817-Monroe
the approbation which it announces of my conduct in the preceding term affords me a consolation which i shall profoundly feel through life,1821-Monroe
in a government which is founded by the people who possess exclusively the sovereignty it seems proper that the person who may be placed by their suffrages in this high trust should declare on commencing its duties the principles on which he intends to conduct the administration,1821-Monroe
it is by a thorough knowledge of the whole subject that our fellow citizens are enabled to judge correctly of the past and to give a proper direction to the future,1821-Monroe
with this view after reducing our land force to the basis of a peace establishment which has been further modified since provision was made for the construction of fortifications at proper points through the whole extent of our coast and such an augmentation of our naval force as should be well adapted to both purposes,1821-Monroe
a force adequate to the enemy collected at that single point with suitable preparation for such others as might be menaced is all that would be requisite,1821-Monroe
peace and good will have been and will hereafter be cultivated with all and by the most faithful regard to justice,1821-Monroe
its agriculture commerce manufactures fisheries revenue in short its peace may all be affected by it,1821-Monroe
this being a contest between different parts of the same community in which other powers had not interfered was not affected by their accommodations,1821-Monroe
no aid has been afforded to either nor has any privilege been enjoyed by the one which has not been equally open to the other party and every exertion has been made in its power to enforce the execution of the laws prohibiting illegal equipments with equal rigor against both,1821-Monroe
shortly after the general peace a band of adventurers took advantage of this conflict and of the facility which it afforded to establish a system of buccaneering in the neighboring seas to the great annoyance of the commerce of the united states and as was represented of that of other powers,1821-Monroe
the decisions of upright and enlightened tribunals fall equally on all whose crimes subject them by a fair interpretation of the law to its censure,1821-Monroe
the provision made by it for such of our citizens as have claims on spain of the character described will it is presumed be very satisfactory to them and the boundary which is established between the territories of the parties westward of the mississippi heretofore in dispute has it is thought been settled on conditions just and advantageous to both,1821-Monroe
it gives us several excellent harbors in the gulf of mexico for ships of war of the largest size,1821-Monroe
the restraints imposed on that commerce by great britain and reciprocated by the united states on a principle of defense continue still in force,1821-Monroe
the situation of the united states in regard to their resources the extent of their revenue and the facility with which it is raised affords a most gratifying spectacle,1821-Monroe
under the present depression of prices affecting all the productions of the country and every branch of industry proceeding from causes explained on a former occasion the revenue has considerably diminished the effect of which has been to compel congress either to abandon these great measures of defense or to resort to loans or internal taxes to supply the deficiency,1821-Monroe
should the deficiency still continue and especially should it be probable that it would be permanent the course to be pursued appears to me to be obvious,1821-Monroe
i am satisfied that internal duties and excises with corresponding imposts on foreign articles of the same kind would without imposing any serious burdens on the people enhance the price of produce promote our manufactures and augment the revenue at the same time that they made it more secure and permanent,1821-Monroe
they have claims on the magnanimity and i may add on the justice of this nation which we must all feel,1821-Monroe
should the flame light up in any quarter how far it may extend it is impossible to foresee,1821-Monroe
for like injuries it will be incumbent on us to seek redress in a spirit of amity in full confidence that injuring none none would knowingly injure us,1821-Monroe
the talents and virtues which were displayed in that great struggle were a sure presage of all that has since followed,1821-Monroe
in them there were distinct orders a nobility and a people or the people governed in one assembly,1821-Monroe
perfection in our organization could not have been expected in the outset either in the national or state governments or in tracing the line between their respective powers,1821-Monroe
what has been the progress since that time,1821-Monroe
we now fellow citizens comprise within our limits the dimensions and faculties of a great power under a government possessing all the energies of any government ever known to the old world with an utter incapacity to oppress the people,1821-Monroe
that revered instrument enumerates the powers and prescribes the duties of the executive magistrate and in its first words declares the purposes to which these and the whole action of the government instituted by it should be invariably and sacredly devoted to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defense promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to the people of this union in their successive generations,1825-Adams
we now receive it as a precious inheritance from those to whom we are indebted for its establishment doubly bound by the examples which they have left us and by the blessings which we have enjoyed as the fruits of their labors to transmit the same unimpaired to the succeeding generation,1825-Adams
the consummation of both was effected by this constitution,1825-Adams
the people of other nations inhabitants of regions acquired not by conquest but by compact have been united with us in the participation of our rights and duties of our burdens and blessings,1825-Adams
such is the unexaggerated picture of our condition under a constitution founded upon the republican principle of equal rights,1825-Adams
it is a source of gratification and of encouragement to me to observe that the great result of this experiment upon the theory of human rights has at the close of that generation by which it was formed been crowned with success equal to the most sanguine expectations of its founders,1825-Adams
the revolutionary wars of europe commencing precisely at the moment when the government of the united states first went into operation under this constitution excited a collision of sentiments and of sympathies which kindled all the passions and imbittered the conflict of parties till the nation was involved in war and the union was shaken to its center,1825-Adams
if there have been those who doubted whether a confederated representative democracy were a government competent to the wise and orderly management of the common concerns of a mighty nation those doubts have been dispelled if there have been projects of partial confederacies to be erected upon the ruins of the union they have been scattered to the winds if there have been dangerous attachments to one foreign nation and antipathies against another they have been extinguished,1825-Adams
it is this which gives inestimable value to the character of our government at once federal and national,1825-Adams
to respect the rights of the state governments is the inviolable duty of that of the union the government of every state will feel its own obligation to respect and preserve the rights of the whole,1825-Adams
it has passed away in a period of profound peace how much to the satisfaction of our country and to the honor of our country s name is known to you all,1825-Adams
it is that from which i am convinced that the unborn millions of our posterity who are in future ages to people this continent will derive their most fervent gratitude to the founders of the union that in which the beneficent action of its government will be most deeply felt and acknowledged,1825-Adams
but nearly twenty years have passed since the construction of the first national road was commenced,1825-Adams
i can not but hope that by the same process of friendly patient and persevering deliberation all constitutional objections will ultimately be removed,1825-Adams
intentions upright and pure a heart devoted to the welfare of our country and the unceasing application of all the faculties allotted to me to her service are all the pledges that i can give for the faithful performance of the arduous duties i am to undertake,1825-Adams
and the principles of action by which i shall endeavor to accomplish this circle of duties it is now proper for me briefly to explain,1829-Jackson
under every aspect in which it can be considered it would appear that advantage must result from the observance of a strict and faithful economy,1829-Jackson
considering standing armies as dangerous to free governments in time of peace i shall not seek to enlarge our present establishment nor disregard that salutary lesson of political experience which teaches that the military should be held subordinate to the civil power,1829-Jackson
to any just system therefore calculated to strengthen this natural safeguard of the country i shall cheerfully lend all the aid in my power,1829-Jackson
the same diffidence induces me to hope for instruction and aid from the coordinate branches of the government and for the indulgence and support of my fellow citizens generally,1829-Jackson
so many events have occurred within the last four years which have necessarily called forth sometimes under circumstances the most delicate and painful my views of the principles and policy which ought to be pursued by the general government that i need on this occasion but allude to a few leading considerations connected with some of them,1833-Jackson
these great objects are necessarily connected and can only be attained by an enlightened exercise of the powers of each within its appropriate sphere in conformity with the public will constitutionally expressed,1833-Jackson
but of equal and indeed of incalculable importance is the union of these states and the sacred duty of all to contribute to its preservation by a liberal support of the general government in the exercise of its just powers,1833-Jackson
in supporting it therefore we support all that is dear to the freeman and the philanthropist,1833-Jackson
let us realize the importance of the attitude in which we stand before the world,1833-Jackson
constantly bearing in mind that in entering into society individuals must give up a share of liberty to preserve the rest it will be my desire so to discharge my duties as to foster with our brethren in all parts of the country a spirit of liberal concession and compromise and by reconciling our fellow citizens to those partial sacrifices which they must unavoidably make for the preservation of a greater good to recommend our invaluable government and union to the confidence and affections of the american people,1833-Jackson
if such men in the position i now occupy felt themselves overwhelmed by a sense of gratitude for this the highest of all marks of their country s confidence and by a consciousness of their inability adequately to discharge the duties of an office so difficult and exalted how much more must these considerations affect one who can rely on no such claims for favor or forbearance,1837-VanBuren
abroad we enjoy the respect and with scarcely an exception the friendship of every nation at home while our government quietly but efficiently performs the sole legitimate end of political institutions in doing the greatest good to the greatest number we present an aggregate of human prosperity surely not elsewhere to be found,1837-VanBuren
looking upon it with the eyes of statesmen and patriots they saw all the sources of rapid and wonderful prosperity but they saw also that various habits opinions and institutions peculiar to the various portions of so vast a region were deeply fixed,1837-VanBuren
a natural fear that the broad scope of general legislation might bear upon and unwisely control particular interests was counteracted by limits strictly drawn around the action of the federal authority and to the people and the states was left unimpaired their sovereign power over the innumerable subjects embraced in the internal government of a just republic excepting such only as necessarily appertain to the concerns of the whole confederacy or its intercourse as a united community with the other nations of the world,1837-VanBuren
our commerce has been extended to the remotest nations the value and even nature of our productions have been greatly changed a wide difference has arisen in the relative wealth and resources of every portion of our country yet the spirit of mutual regard and of faithful adherence to existing compacts has continued to prevail in our councils and never long been absent from our conduct,1837-VanBuren
latent and uncontrollable causes of dissolution were supposed to exist even by the wise and good and not only did unfriendly or speculative theorists anticipate for us the fate of past republics but the fears of many an honest patriot overbalanced his sanguine hopes,1837-VanBuren
in the early stages of the new government when all felt the imposing influence as they recognized the unequaled services of the first president it was a common sentiment that the great weight of his character could alone bind the discordant materials of our government together and save us from the violence of contending factions,1837-VanBuren
these occurrences however have been far less frequent in our country than in any other of equal population on the globe and with the diffusion of intelligence it may well be hoped that they will constantly diminish in frequency and violence,1837-VanBuren
we may not possess as we should not desire to possess the extended and ever ready military organization of other nations we may occasionally suffer in the outset for the want of it but among ourselves all doubt upon this great point has ceased while a salutary experience will prevent a contrary opinion from inviting aggression from abroad,1837-VanBuren
the power and influence of the republic have arisen to a height obvious to all mankind respect for its authority was not more apparent at its ancient than it is at its present limits new and inexhaustible sources of general prosperity have been opened the effects of distance have been averted by the inventive genius of our people developed and fostered by the spirit of our institutions and the enlarged variety and amount of interests productions and pursuits have strengthened the chain of mutual dependence and formed a circle of mutual benefits too apparent ever to be overlooked,1837-VanBuren
while the federal government has successfully performed its appropriate functions in relation to foreign affairs and concerns evidently national that of every state has remarkably improved in protecting and developing local interests and individual welfare and if the vibrations of authority have occasionally tended too much toward one or the other it is unquestionably certain that the ultimate operation of the entire system has been to strengthen all the existing institutions and to elevate our whole country in prosperity and renown,1837-VanBuren
amidst the violence of excited passions this generous and fraternal feeling has been sometimes disregarded and standing as i now do before my countrymen in this high place of honor and of trust i can not refrain from anxiously invoking my fellow citizens never to be deaf to its dictates,1837-VanBuren
the result authorizes me to believe that they have been approved and are confided in by a majority of the people of the united states including those whom they most immediately affect it now only remains to add that no bill conflicting with these views can ever receive my constitutional sanction,1837-VanBuren
such attempts at dangerous agitation may periodically return but with each the object will be better understood,1837-VanBuren
we have seen time gradually dispel every unfavorable foreboding and our constitution surmount every adverse circumstance dreaded at the outset as beyond control,1837-VanBuren
to enter on this occasion into a further or more minute exposition of my views on the various questions of domestic policy would be as obtrusive as it is probably unexpected,1837-VanBuren
we decline alliances as adverse to our peace,1837-VanBuren
in approaching then in the presence of my assembled countrymen to make the solemn promise that yet remains and to pledge myself that i will faithfully execute the office i am about to fill i bring with me a settled purpose to maintain the institutions of my country which i trust will atone for the errors i commit,1837-VanBuren
may it be among the dispensations of his providence to bless our beloved country with honors and with length of days,1837-VanBuren
although the fiat of the people has gone forth proclaiming me the chief magistrate of this glorious union nothing upon their part remaining to be done it may be thought that a motive may exist to keep up the delusion under which they may be supposed to have acted in relation to my principles and opinions and perhaps there may be some in this assembly who have come here either prepared to condemn those i shall now deliver or approving them to doubt the sincerity with which they are now uttered,1841-Harrison
if such is its theory those who are called upon to administer it must recognize as its leading principle the duty of shaping their measures so as to produce the greatest good to the greatest number,1841-Harrison
the constitution of the united states is the instrument containing this grant of power to the several departments composing the government,1841-Harrison
the boasted privilege of a roman citizen was to him a shield only against a petty provincial ruler whilst the proud democrat of athens would console himself under a sentence of death for a supposed violation of the national faith which no one understood and which at times was the subject of the mockery of all or the banishment from his home his family and his country with or without an alleged cause that it was the act not of a single tyrant or hated aristocracy but of his assembled countrymen,1841-Harrison
notwithstanding the limited sovereignty possessed by the people of the united stages and the restricted grant of power to the government which they have adopted enough has been given to accomplish all the objects for which it was created,1841-Harrison
and the fact that many of our statesmen most distinguished for talent and patriotism have been at one time or other of their political career on both sides of each of the most warmly disputed questions forces upon us the inference that the errors if errors there were are attributable to the intrinsic difficulty in many instances of ascertaining the intentions of the framers of the constitution rather than the influence of any sinister or unpatriotic motive,1841-Harrison
there were in it features which appeared not to be in harmony with their ideas of a simple representative democracy or republic and knowing the tendency of power to increase itself particularly when exercised by a single individual predictions were made that at no very remote period the government would terminate in virtual monarchy,1841-Harrison
the sagacious mind of mr jefferson early saw and lamented this error and attempts have been made hitherto without success to apply the amendatory power of the states to its correction,1841-Harrison
it is the never dying worm in his bosom grows with his growth and strengthens with the declining years of its victim,1841-Harrison
i can not conceive that by a fair construction any or either of its provisions would be found to constitute the president a part of the legislative power,1841-Harrison
so a similar power has necessarily resulted from that instrument to the judiciary and yet the judiciary forms no part of the legislature,1841-Harrison
at the period of the formation of the constitution the principle does not appear to have enjoyed much favor in the state governments,1841-Harrison
to assist or control congress then in its ordinary legislation could not i conceive have been the motive for conferring the veto power on the president,1841-Harrison
it could not but have occurred to the convention that in a country so extensive embracing so great a variety of soil and climate and consequently of products and which from the same causes must ever exhibit a great difference in the amount of the population of its various sections calling for a great diversity in the employments of the people that the legislation of the majority might not always justly regard the rights and interests of the minority and that acts of this character might be passed under an express grant by the words of the constitution and therefore not within the competency of the judiciary to declare void that however enlightened and patriotic they might suppose from past experience the members of congress might be and however largely partaking in the general of the liberal feelings of the people it was impossible to expect that bodies so constituted should not sometimes be controlled by local interests and sectional feelings,1841-Harrison
in reference to the second of these objects i may observe that i consider it the right and privilege of the people to decide disputed points of the constitution arising from the general grant of power to congress to carry into effect the powers expressly given and i believe with mr madison that repeated recognitions under varied circumstances in acts of the legislative executive and judicial branches of the government accompanied by indications in different modes of the concurrence of the general will of the nation as affording to the president sufficient authority for his considering such disputed points as settled,1841-Harrison
without denying that the result to which they looked with so much apprehension is in the way of being realized it is obvious that they did not clearly see the mode of its accomplishment the general government has seized upon none of the reserved rights of the states,1841-Harrison
but there is still an undercurrent at work by which if not seasonably checked the worst apprehensions of our antifederal patriots will be realized and not only will the state authorities be overshadowed by the great increase of power in the executive department of the general government but the character of that government if not its designation be essentially and radically changed,1841-Harrison
but it is not by the extent of its patronage alone that the executive department has become dangerous but by the use which it appears may be made of the appointing power to bring under its control the whole revenues of the country,1841-Harrison
i am not insensible of the great difficulty that exists in drawing a proper plan for the safe keeping and disbursement of the public revenues and i know the importance which has been attached by men of great abilities and patriotism to the divorce as it is called of the treasury from the banking institutions it is not the divorce which is complained of but the unhallowed union of the treasury with the executive department which has created such extensive alarm,1841-Harrison
the influence of the executive in controlling the freedom of the elective franchise through the medium of the public officers can be effectually checked by renewing the prohibition published by mr jefferson forbidding their interference in elections further than giving their own votes and their own independence secured by an assurance of perfect immunity in exercising this sacred privilege of freemen under the dictates of their own unbiased judgments,1841-Harrison
the presses in the necessary employment of the government should never be used to clear the guilty or to varnish crime,1841-Harrison
there are others however which can not be introduced in our system without singular incongruity and the production of much mischief and this i conceive to be one,1841-Harrison
it is in his power also to propose amendments in the existing revenue laws suggested by his observations upon their defective or injurious operation,1841-Harrison
if any single scheme could produce the effect of arresting at once that mutation of condition by which thousands of our most indigent fellow citizens by their industry and enterprise are raised to the possession of wealth that is the one,1841-Harrison
it is in this district only where american citizens are to be found who under a settled policy are deprived of many important political privileges without any inspiring hope as to the future,1841-Harrison
are there indeed citizens of any of our states who have dreamed of their subjects in the district of columbia,1841-Harrison
if this be true and it will scarcely be denied by anyone who has a correct idea of his own rights as an american citizen the grant to congress of exclusive jurisdiction in the district of columbia can be interpreted so far as respects the aggregate people of the united states as meaning nothing more than to allow to congress the controlling power necessary to afford a free and safe exercise of the functions assigned to the general government by the constitution,1841-Harrison
strong as is the tie of interest it has been often found ineffectual,1841-Harrison
no participation in any good possessed by any member of our extensive confederacy except in domestic government was withheld from the citizen of any other member,1841-Harrison
it may be observed however that organized associations of citizens requiring compliance with their wishes too much resemble the recommendations of athens to her allies supported by an armed and powerful fleet,1841-Harrison
our confederacy fellow citizens can only be preserved by the same forbearance,1841-Harrison
it should be our constant and earnest endeavor mutually to cultivate a spirit of concord and harmony among the various parts of our confederacy,1841-Harrison
on the contrary it is our duty to encourage them to the extent of our constitutional authority to apply their best means and cheerfully to make all necessary sacrifices and submit to all necessary burdens to fulfill their engagements and maintain their credit for the character and credit of the several states form a part of the character and credit of the whole country,1841-Harrison
on the contrary no care that can be used in the construction of our government no division of powers no distribution of checks in its several departments will prove effectual to keep us a free people if this spirit is suffered to decay and decay it will without constant nurture,1841-Harrison
in the name of democracy they speak warning the people against the influence of wealth and the danger of aristocracy,1841-Harrison
it is in periods like this that it behooves the people to be most watchful of those to whom they have intrusted power,1841-Harrison
the foregoing remarks relate almost exclusively to matters connected with our domestic concerns,1841-Harrison
i can conceive of no more sublime spectacle none more likely to propitiate an impartial and common creator than a rigid adherence to the principles of justice on the part of a powerful nation in its transactions with a weaker and uncivilized people whom circumstances have placed at its disposal,1841-Harrison
we have examples of republics where the love of country and of liberty at one time were the dominant passions of the whole mass of citizens and yet with the continuance of the name and forms of free government not a vestige of these qualities remaining in the bosoms of any one of its citizens,1841-Harrison
such a tendency has existed does exist,1841-Harrison
something however may be effected by the means which they have placed in my hands,1841-Harrison
fellow citizens being fully invested with that high office to which the partiality of my countrymen has called me i now take an affectionate leave of you,1841-Harrison
if the more aged and experienced men who have filled the office of president of the united states even in the infancy of the republic distrusted their ability to discharge the duties of that exalted station what ought not to be the apprehensions of one so much younger and less endowed now that our domain extends from ocean to ocean that our people have so greatly increased in numbers and at a time when so great diversity of opinion prevails in regard to the principles and policy which should characterize the administration of our government,1845-Polk
the constitution itself plainly written as it is the safeguard of our federative compact the offspring of concession and compromise binding together in the bonds of peace and union this great and increasing family of free and independent states will be the chart by which i shall be directed,1845-Polk
the government of the union acting within the sphere of its delegated authority is also a complete sovereignty,1845-Polk
it does not force reform on the states,1845-Polk
to effect objects so dear to every patriot i shall devote myself with anxious solicitude,1845-Polk
minorities have a right to appeal to the constitution as a shield against such oppression,1845-Polk
when judiciously and properly exercised the constitution itself may be saved from infraction and the rights of all preserved and protected,1845-Polk
new communities and states are seeking protection under its aegis and multitudes from the old world are flocking to our shores to participate in its blessings,1845-Polk
all distinctions of birth or of rank have been abolished,1845-Polk
to perpetuate them it is our sacred duty to preserve it,1845-Polk
he would extinguish the fire of liberty which warms and animates the hearts of happy millions and invites all the nations of the earth to imitate our example,1845-Polk
to preserve it the compromises which alone enabled our fathers to form a common constitution for the government and protection of so many states and distinct communities of such diversified habits interests and domestic institutions must be sacredly and religiously observed,1845-Polk
to secure a continuance of that devotion the compromises of the constitution must not only be preserved but sectional jealousies and heartburnings must be discountenanced and all should remember that they are members of the same political family having a common destiny,1845-Polk
we need no national banks or other extraneous institutions planted around the government to control or strengthen it in opposition to the will of its authors,1845-Polk
melancholy is the condition of that people whose government can be sustained only by a system which periodically transfers large amounts from the labor of the many to the coffers of the few,1845-Polk
happy would it be for the indebted states if they were freed from their liabilities many of which were incautiously contracted,1845-Polk
in the general proposition that no more money shall be collected than the necessities of an economical administration shall require all parties seem to acquiesce,1845-Polk
the power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises was an indispensable one to be conferred on the federal government which without it would possess no means of providing for its own support,1845-Polk
the incidental protection afforded to our home interests by discriminations within the revenue range it is believed will be ample,1845-Polk
to tax one branch of this home industry for the benefit of another would be unjust,1845-Polk
these general views long entertained on this subject i have deemed it proper to reiterate,1845-Polk
i congratulate my country that by an act of the late congress of the united states the assent of this government has been given to the reunion and it only remains for the two countries to agree upon the terms to consummate an object so important to both,1845-Polk
to enlarge its limits is to extend the dominions of peace over additional territories and increasing millions,1845-Polk
in the earlier stages of our national existence the opinion prevailed with some that our system of confederated states could not operate successfully over an extended territory and serious objections have at different times been made to the enlargement of our boundaries,1845-Polk
as our boundaries have been enlarged and our agricultural population has been spread over a large surface our federative system has acquired additional strength and security,1845-Polk
is there one who would not prefer free intercourse with her to high duties on all our products and manufactures which enter her ports or cross her frontiers,1845-Polk
upon the same principle that they would refuse to form a perpetual union with texas because of her local institutions our forefathers would have been prevented from forming our present union,1845-Polk
within that period within the lifetime i might say of some of my hearers our people increasing to many millions have filled the eastern valley of the mississippi adventurously ascended the missouri to its headsprings and are already engaged in establishing the blessings of self government in valleys of which the rivers flow to the pacific,1845-Polk
in the meantime every obligation imposed by treaty or conventional stipulations should be sacredly respected,1845-Polk
from those officers especially who are charged with the collection and disbursement of the public revenue will prompt and rigid accountability be required,1845-Polk
elected by the american people to the highest office known to our laws i appear here to take the oath prescribed by the constitution and in compliance with a time honored custom to address those who are now assembled,1849-Taylor
in the discharge of these duties my guide will be the constitution which i this day swear to preserve protect and defend,1849-Taylor
in reference to the army and navy lately employed with so much distinction on active service care shall be taken to insure the highest condition of efficiency and in furtherance of that object the military and naval schools sustained by the liberality of congress shall receive the special attention of the executive,1849-Taylor
the appointing power vested in the president imposes delicate and onerous duties,1849-Taylor
in conclusion i congratulate you my fellow citizens upon the high state of prosperity to which the goodness of divine providence has conducted our common country,1849-Taylor
i ought to be and am truly grateful for the rare manifestation of the nation s confidence but this so far from lightening my obligations only adds to their weight,1853-Pierce
at that moment however when the agitation consequent upon the revolutionary struggle had hardly subsided when we were just emerging from the weakness and embarrassments of the confederation there was an evident consciousness of vigor equal to the great mission so wisely and bravely fulfilled by our fathers,1853-Pierce
the thoughts of the men of that day were as practical as their sentiments were patriotic,1853-Pierce
the oppressed throughout the world from that day to the present have turned their eyes hitherward not to find those lights extinguished or to fear lest they should wane but to be constantly cheered by their steady and increasing radiance,1853-Pierce
our fathers decided for themselves both upon the hour to declare and the hour to strike,1853-Pierce
the stars upon your banner have become nearly threefold their original number your densely populated possessions skirt the shores of the two great oceans and yet this vast increase of people and territory has not only shown itself compatible with the harmonious action of the states and federal government in their respective constitutional spheres but has afforded an additional guaranty of the strength and integrity of both,1853-Pierce
purposes therefore at once just and pacific will be significantly marked in the conduct of our foreign affairs,1853-Pierce
but if your past is limited your future is boundless,1853-Pierce
we can desire nothing in regard to them so much as to see them consolidate their strength and pursue the paths of prosperity and happiness,1853-Pierce
but the vast interests of commerce are common to all mankind and the advantages of trade and international intercourse must always present a noble field for the moral influence of a great people,1853-Pierce
and in this connection it can hardly be necessary to reaffirm a principle which should now be regarded as fundamental,1853-Pierce
and the skill and self devotion of the navy assure you that you may take the performance of the past as a pledge for the future and may confidently expect that the flag which has waved its untarnished folds over every sea will still float in undiminished honor,1853-Pierce
good citizens may well claim the protection of good laws and the benign influence of good government but a claim for office is what the people of a republic should never recognize,1853-Pierce
they require at my hands diligence integrity and capacity wherever there are duties to be performed,1853-Pierce
you have a right therefore to expect your agents in every department to regard strictly the limits imposed upon them by the constitution of the united states,1853-Pierce
my own position upon this subject was clear and unequivocal upon the record of my words and my acts and it is only recurred to at this time because silence might perhaps be misconstrued,1853-Pierce
do my countrymen need any assurance that such a catastrophe is not to overtake them while i possess the power to stay it,1853-Pierce
to every theory of society or government whether the offspring of feverish ambition or of morbid enthusiasm calculated to dissolve the bonds of law and affection which unite us i shall interpose a ready and stern resistance,1853-Pierce
such have been and are my convictions and upon them i shall act,1853-Pierce
it must be felt that there is no national security but in the nation s humble acknowledged dependence upon god and his overruling providence,1853-Pierce
standing as i do almost within view of the green slopes of monticello and as it were within reach of the tomb of washington with all the cherished memories of the past gathering around me like so many eloquent voices of exhortation from heaven i can express no better hope for my country than that the kind providence which smiled upon our fathers may enable their children to preserve the blessings they have inherited,1853-Pierce
we have recently passed through a presidential contest in which the passions of our fellow citizens were excited to the highest degree by questions of deep and vital importance but when the people proclaimed their will the tempest at once subsided and all was calm,1857-Buchanan
as a natural consequence congress has also prescribed that when the territory of kansas shall be admitted as a state it shall be received into the union with or without slavery as their constitution may prescribe at the time of their admission,1857-Buchanan
but be this as it may it is the imperative and indispensable duty of the government of the united states to secure to every resident inhabitant the free and independent expression of his opinion by his vote,1857-Buchanan
may we not then hope that the long agitation on this subject is approaching its end and that the geographical parties to which it has given birth so much dreaded by the father of his country will speedily become extinct,1857-Buchanan
under our system there is a remedy for all mere political evils in the sound sense and sober judgment of the people,1857-Buchanan
let every union loving man therefore exert his best influence to suppress this agitation which since the recent legislation of congress is without any legitimate object,1857-Buchanan
we at present enjoy a free trade throughout our extensive and expanding country such as the world has never witnessed,1857-Buchanan
next in importance to the maintenance of the constitution and the union is the duty of preserving the government free from the taint or even the suspicion of corruption,1857-Buchanan
it produces wild schemes of expenditure and begets a race of speculators and jobbers whose ingenuity is exerted in contriving and promoting expedients to obtain public money,1857-Buchanan
it is beyond all question the true principle that no more revenue ought to be collected from the people than the amount necessary to defray the expenses of a wise economical and efficient administration of the government,1857-Buchanan
in administering this important trust whilst it may be wise to grant portions of them for the improvement of the remainder yet we should never forget that it is our cardinal policy to reserve these lands as much as may be for actual settlers and this at moderate prices,1857-Buchanan
the federal constitution is a grant from the states to congress of certain specific powers and the question whether this grant should be liberally or strictly construed has more or less divided political parties from the beginning,1857-Buchanan
whilst deeply convinced of these truths i yet consider it clear that under the war making power congress may appropriate money toward the construction of a military road when this is absolutely necessary for the defense of any state or territory of the union against foreign invasion,1857-Buchanan
it is impossible to conceive that whilst the constitution has expressly required congress to defend all the states it should yet deny to them by any fair construction the only possible means by which one of these states can be defended,1857-Buchanan
it may be proper that on this occasion i should make some brief remarks in regard to our rights and duties as a member of the great family of nations,1857-Buchanan
to avoid entangling alliances has been a maxim of our policy ever since the days of washington and its wisdom s no one will attempt to dispute,1857-Buchanan
our past history forbids that we shall in the future acquire territory unless this be sanctioned by the laws of justice and honor,1857-Buchanan
fellow citizens of the united states in compliance with a custom as old as the government itself i appear before you to address you briefly and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the constitution of the united states to be taken by the president before he enters on the execution of this office,1861-Lincoln
it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you,1861-Lincoln
resolved that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the states and especially the right of each state to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any state or territory no matter what pretext as among the gravest of crimes,1861-Lincoln
no person held to service or labor in one state under the laws thereof escaping into another shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein be discharged from such service or labor but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due,1861-Lincoln
there is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by state authority but surely that difference is not a very material one,1861-Lincoln
i take the official oath to day with no mental reservations and with no purpose to construe the constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules and while i do not choose now to specify particular acts of congress as proper to be enforced i do suggest that it will be much safer for all both in official and private stations to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed than to violate any of them trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional,1861-Lincoln
a disruption of the federal union heretofore only menaced is now formidably attempted,1861-Lincoln
again if the united states be not a government proper but an association of states in the nature of contract merely can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it,1861-Lincoln
it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in 1776,1861-Lincoln
i therefore consider that in view of the constitution and the laws the union is unbroken and to the extent of my ability i shall take care as the constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me that the laws of the union be faithfully executed in all the states,1861-Lincoln
where hostility to the united states in any interior locality shall be so great and universal as to prevent competent resident citizens from holding the federal offices there will be no attempt to force obnoxious strangers among the people for that object,1861-Lincoln
that there are persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the union at all events and are glad of any pretext to do it i will neither affirm nor deny but if there be such i need address no word to them,1861-Lincoln
all profess to be content in the union if all constitutional rights can be maintained,1861-Lincoln
if by the mere force of numbers a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right it might in a moral point of view justify revolution certainly would if such right were a vital one,1861-Lincoln
shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by state authority,1861-Lincoln
the constitution does not expressly say,1861-Lincoln
for instance why may not any portion of a new confederacy a year or two hence arbitrarily secede again precisely as portions of the present union now claim to secede from it,1861-Lincoln
whoever rejects it does of necessity fly to anarchy or to despotism,1861-Lincoln
at the same time the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the supreme court the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will have ceased to be their own rulers having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal,1861-Lincoln
the fugitive slave clause of the constitution and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforced perhaps as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself,1861-Lincoln
we can not remove our respective sections from each other nor build an impassable wall between them,1861-Lincoln
can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends,1861-Lincoln
while i make no recommendation of amendments i fully recognize the rightful authority of the people over the whole subject to be exercised in either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself and i should under existing circumstances favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it,1861-Lincoln
the people themselves can do this if also they choose but the executive as such has nothing to do with it,1861-Lincoln
if the almighty ruler of nations with his eternal truth and justice be on your side of the north or on yours of the south that truth and that justice will surely prevail by the judgment of this great tribunal of the american people,1861-Lincoln
if there be an object to hurry any of you in hot haste to a step which you would never take deliberately that object will be frustrated by taking time but no good object can be frustrated by it,1861-Lincoln
the government will not assail you,1861-Lincoln
we must not be enemies,1861-Lincoln
then a statement somewhat in detail of a course to be pursued seemed fitting and proper,1865-Lincoln
all dreaded it all sought to avert it,1865-Lincoln
all knew that this interest was somehow the cause of the war,1865-Lincoln
both read the same bible and pray to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other,1865-Lincoln
woe unto the world because of offenses for it must needs be that offenses come but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh,1865-Lincoln
citizens of the united states,1869-Grant
i bring to it a conscious desire and determination to fill it to the best of my ability to the satisfaction of the people,1869-Grant
the country having just emerged from a great rebellion many questions will come before it for settlement in the next four years which preceding administrations have never had to deal with,1869-Grant
the payment of this principal and interest as well as the return to a specie basis as soon as it can be accomplished without material detriment to the debtor class or to the country at large must be provided for,1869-Grant
why it looks as though providence had bestowed upon us a strong box in the precious metals locked up in the sterile mountains of the far west and which we are now forging the key to unlock to meet the very contingency that is now upon us,1869-Grant
the young men of the country those who from their age must be its rulers twenty five years hence have a peculiar interest in maintaining the national honor,1869-Grant
legislation upon this subject may not be necessary now or even advisable but it will be when the civil law is more fully restored in all parts of the country and trade resumes its wonted channels,1869-Grant
if others depart from this rule in their dealings with us we may be compelled to follow their precedent,1869-Grant
in conclusion i ask patient forbearance one toward another throughout the land and a determined effort on the part of every citizen to do his share toward cementing a happy union and i ask the prayers of the nation to almighty god in behalf of this consummation,1869-Grant
when my first term of the office of chief executive began the country had not recovered from the effects of a great internal revolution and three of the former states of the union had not been restored to their federal relations,1873-Grant
there could be no extension of territory on the continent which would call for an increase of this force but rather might such extension enable us to diminish it,1873-Grant
this is wrong and should be corrected,1873-Grant
it was not a question of my seeking but was a proposition from the people of santo domingo and which i entertained,1873-Grant
commerce education and rapid transit of thought and matter by telegraph and steam have changed all this,1873-Grant
the wrong inflicted upon him should be taken into account and the balance placed to his credit,1873-Grant
it has been and is my earnest desire to correct abuses that have grown up in the civil service of the country,1873-Grant
this i promise looking forward with the greatest anxiety to the day when i shall be released from responsibilities that at times are almost overwhelming and from which i have scarcely had a respite since the eventful firing upon fort sumter in april 1861 to the present day,1873-Grant
fellow citizens we have assembled to repeat the public ceremonial begun by washington observed by all my predecessors and now a time honored custom which marks the commencement of a new term of the presidential office,1877-Hayes
the permanent pacification of the country upon such principles and by such measures as will secure the complete protection of all its citizens in the free enjoyment of all their constitutional rights is now the one subject in our public affairs which all thoughtful and patriotic citizens regard as of supreme importance,1877-Hayes
whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the cause of this condition of things the fact is clear that in the progress of events the time has come when such government is the imperative necessity required by all the varied interests public and private of those states,1877-Hayes
in furtherance of such obedience to the letter and the spirit of the constitution and in behalf of all that its attainment implies all so called party interests lose their apparent importance and party lines may well be permitted to fade into insignificance,1877-Hayes
that a moral obligation rests upon the national government to employ its constitutional power and influence to establish the rights of the people it has emancipated and to protect them in the enjoyment of those rights when they are infringed or assailed is also generally admitted,1877-Hayes
but at the basis of all prosperity for that as well as for every other part of the country lies the improvement of the intellectual and moral condition of the people,1877-Hayes
they neither expected nor desired from public officers any partisan service,1877-Hayes
it must be regarded as the expression of the united voice and will of the whole country upon this subject and both political parties are virtually pledged to give it their unreserved support,1877-Hayes
it is very gratifying however to be able to say that there are indications all around us of a coming change to prosperous times,1877-Hayes
the policy inaugurated by my honored predecessor president grant of submitting to arbitration grave questions in dispute between ourselves and foreign powers points to a new and incomparably the best instrumentality for the preservation of peace and will as i believe become a beneficent example of the course to be pursued in similar emergencies by other nations,1877-Hayes
that tribunal established by law for this sole purpose its members all of them men of long established reputation for integrity and intelligence and with the exception of those who are also members of the supreme judiciary chosen equally from both political parties its deliberations enlightened by the research and the arguments of able counsel was entitled to the fullest confidence of the american people,1877-Hayes
the fact that two great political parties have in this way settled a dispute in regard to which good men differ as to the facts and the law no less than as to the proper course to be pursued in solving the question in controversy is an occasion for general rejoicing,1877-Hayes
we stand to day upon an eminence which overlooks a hundred years of national life a century crowded with perils but crowned with the triumphs of liberty and law,1881-Garfield
the decisive battle of the war for independence whose centennial anniversary will soon be gratefully celebrated at yorktown had not yet been fought,1881-Garfield
under this constitution our people long ago made themselves safe against danger from without and secured for their mariners and flag equality of rights on all the seas,1881-Garfield
and now at the close of this first century of growth with the inspirations of its history in their hearts our people have lately reviewed the condition of the nation passed judgment upon the conduct and opinions of political parties and have registered their will concerning the future administration of the government,1881-Garfield
that discussion which for half a century threatened the existence of the union was closed at last in the high court of war by a decree from which there is no appeal that the constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof are and shall continue to be the supreme law of the land binding alike upon the states and the people,1881-Garfield
it has freed us from the perpetual danger of war and dissolution,1881-Garfield
the influence of this force will grow greater and bear richer fruit with the coming years,1881-Garfield
freedom can never yield its fullness of blessings so long as the law or its administration places the smallest obstacle in the pathway of any virtuous citizen,1881-Garfield
so far as my authority can lawfully extend they shall enjoy the full and equal protection of the constitution and the laws,1881-Garfield
so far as the latter is true it is the only palliation that can be offered for opposing the freedom of the ballot,1881-Garfield
it has been said that unsettled questions have no pity for the repose of nations,1881-Garfield
we have no standard by which to measure the disaster that may be brought upon us by ignorance and vice in the citizens when joined to corruption and fraud in the suffrage,1881-Garfield
but the responsibility for the existence of slavery did not rest upon the south alone,1881-Garfield
in this beneficent work sections and races should be forgotten and partisanship should be unknown,1881-Garfield
is it not possible for us now to make a truce with time by anticipating and accepting its inevitable verdict,1881-Garfield
the preservation of the public credit and the resumption of specie payments so successfully attained by the administration of my predecessors have enabled our people to secure the blessings which the seasons brought,1881-Garfield
the chief duty of the national government in connection with the currency of the country is to coin money and declare its value,1881-Garfield
the refunding of the national debt at a lower rate of interest should be accomplished without compelling the withdrawal of the national bank notes and thus disturbing the business of the country,1881-Garfield
as the government lights our coasts for the protection of mariners and the benefit of commerce so it should give to the tillers of the soil the best lights of practical science and experience,1881-Garfield
various plans to this end have been suggested and will need consideration but none of them has been sufficiently matured to warrant the united states in extending pecuniary aid,1881-Garfield
the territories of the united states are subject to the direct legislative authority of congress and hence the general government is responsible for any violation of the constitution in any of them,1881-Garfield
the civil service can never be placed on a satisfactory basis until it is regulated by law,1881-Garfield
i shall greatly rely upon the wisdom and patriotism of congress and of those who may share with me the responsibilities and duties of administration and above all upon our efforts to promote the welfare of this great people and their government i reverently invoke the support and blessings of almighty god,1881-Garfield
amid the din of party strife the people s choice was made but its attendant circumstances have demonstrated anew the strength and safety of a government by the people,1885-Cleveland
at this hour the animosities of political strife the bitterness of partisan defeat and the exultation of partisan triumph should be supplanted by an ungrudging acquiescence in the popular will and a sober conscientious concern for the general weal,1885-Cleveland
the large variety of diverse and competing interests subject to federal control persistently seeking the recognition of their claims need give us no fear that the greatest good to the greatest number will fail to be accomplished if in the halls of national legislation that spirit of amity and mutual concession shall prevail in which the constitution had its birth,1885-Cleveland
your every voter as surely as your chief magistrate under the same high sanction though in a different sphere exercises a public trust,1885-Cleveland
we should never be ashamed of the simplicity and prudential economies which are best suited to the operation of a republican form of government and most compatible with the mission of the american people,1885-Cleveland
it is the policy of neutrality rejecting any share in foreign broils and ambitions upon other continents and repelling their intrusion here,1885-Cleveland
the laws should be rigidly enforced which prohibit the immigration of a servile class to compete with american labor with no intention of acquiring citizenship and bringing with them and retaining habits and customs repugnant to our civilization,1885-Cleveland
all discussion as to their fitness for the place accorded to them as american citizens is idle and unprofitable except as it suggests the necessity for their improvement,1885-Cleveland
fellow citizens there is no constitutional or legal requirement that the president shall take the oath of office in the presence of the people but there is so manifest an appropriateness in the public induction to office of the chief executive officer of the nation that from the beginning of the government the people to whose service the official oath consecrates the officer have been called to witness the solemn ceremonial,1889-Harrison
surely i do not misinterpret the spirit of the occasion when i assume that the whole body of the people covenant with me and with each other to day to support and defend the constitution and the union of the states to yield willing obedience to all the laws and each to every other citizen his equal civil and political rights,1889-Harrison
when the centennial of the institution of the judicial department by the organization of the supreme court shall have been suitably observed as i trust it will be our nation will have full entered its second century,1889-Harrison
that which was the body has come to be only the rich fringe of the nation s robe,1889-Harrison
the influences of religion have been multiplied and strengthened,1889-Harrison
but on the whole the opportunities offered to the individual to secure the comforts of life are better than are found elsewhere and largely better than they were here one hundred years ago,1889-Harrison
to hold in check the development of our commercial marine to prevent or retard the establishment and growth of manufactures in the states and so to secure the american market for their shops and the carrying trade for their ships was the policy of european statesmen and was pursued with the most selfish vigor,1889-Harrison
it is not a departure but a return that we have witnessed,1889-Harrison
there was this reason only why the states that divide with pennsylvania the mineral treasures of the great southeastern and central mountain ranges should have been so tardy in bringing to the smelting furnace and to the mill the coal and iron from their near opposing hillsides,1889-Harrison
none are excluded from achieving that diversification of pursuits among the people which brings wealth and contentment,1889-Harrison
i look hopefully to the continuance of our protective system and to the consequent development of manufacturing and mining enterprises in the states hitherto wholly given to agriculture as a potent influence in the perfect unification of our people,1889-Harrison
i have altogether rejected the suggestion of a special executive policy for any section of our country,1889-Harrison
the evil example of permitting individuals corporations or communities to nullify the laws because they cross some selfish or local interest or prejudices is full of danger not only to the nation at large but much more to those who use this pernicious expedient to escape their just obligations or to obtain an unjust advantage over others,1889-Harrison
it demoralizes those who practice it and destroys the faith of those who suffer by it in the efficiency of the law as a safe protector,1889-Harrison
a community where law is the rule of conduct and where courts not mobs execute its penalties is the only attractive field for business investments and honest labor,1889-Harrison
we should not cease to be hospitable to immigration but we should cease to be careless as to the character of it,1889-Harrison
we have a just right to expect that our european policy will be the american policy of european courts,1889-Harrison
that which a sense of justice restrains us from seeking they may be reasonably expected willingly to forego,1889-Harrison
but having fairly obtained them by methods and for purposes entirely consistent with the most friendly disposition toward all other powers our consent will be necessary to any modification or impairment of the concession,1889-Harrison
the duty devolved by law upon the president to nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the senate to appoint all public officers whose appointment is not otherwise provided for in the constitution or by act of congress has become very burdensome and its wise and efficient discharge full of difficulty,1889-Harrison
there are many ways in which the convenience and comfort of those who have business with our public offices may be promoted by a thoughtful and obliging officer and i shall expect those whom i may appoint to justify their selection by a conspicuous efficiency in the discharge of their duties,1889-Harrison
beyond this obvious duty i hope to do something more to advance the reform of the civil service,1889-Harrison
while a treasury surplus is not the greatest evil it is a serious evil,1889-Harrison
it will be the duty of congress wisely to forecast and estimate these extraordinary demands and having added them to our ordinary expenditures to so adjust our revenue laws that no considerable annual surplus will remain,1889-Harrison
the spirit courage and skill of our naval officers and seamen have many times in our history given to weak ships and inefficient guns a rating greatly beyond that of the naval list,1889-Harrison
such occasions as this should remind us that we owe everything to their valor and sacrifice,1889-Harrison
it is very gratifying to observe the general interest now being manifested in the reform of our election laws,1889-Harrison
the freedom of the ballot is a condition of our national life and no power vested in congress or in the executive to secure or perpetuate it should remain unused upon occasion,1889-Harrison
how shall those who practice election frauds recover that respect for the sanctity of the ballot which is the first condition and obligation of good citizenship,1889-Harrison
we should hold our differing opinions in mutual respect and having submitted them to the arbitrament of the ballot should accept an adverse judgment with the same respect that we would have demanded of our opponents if the decision had been in our favor,1889-Harrison
dangers have been in frequent ambush along our path but we have uncovered and vanquished them all,1889-Harrison
each state will bring its generous contribution to the great aggregate of the nation s increase,1889-Harrison
while every american citizen must contemplate with the utmost pride and enthusiasm the growth and expansion of our country the sufficiency of our institutions to stand against the rudest shocks of violence the wonderful thrift and enterprise of our people and the demonstrated superiority of our free government it behooves us to constantly watch for every symptom of insidious infirmity that threatens our national vigor,1893-Cleveland
in dealing with our present embarrassing situation as related to this subject we will be wise if we temper our confidence and faith in our national strength and resources with the frank concession that even these will not permit us to defy with impunity the inexorable laws of finance and trade,1893-Cleveland
i refer to the prevalence of a popular disposition to expect from the operation of the government especial and direct individual advantages,1893-Cleveland
it undermines the self reliance of our people and substitutes in its place dependence upon governmental favoritism,1893-Cleveland
every thoughtful american must realize the importance of checking at its beginning any tendency in public or private station to regard frugality and economy as virtues which we may safely outgrow,1893-Cleveland
to secure the fitness and competency of appointees to office and remove from political action the demoralizing madness for spoils civil service reform has found a place in our public policy and laws,1893-Cleveland
to the extent that they can be reached and restrained by federal power the general government should relieve our citizens from their interference and exactions,1893-Cleveland
every effort should be made to lead them through the paths of civilization and education to self supporting and independent citizenship,1893-Cleveland
while there should be no surrender of principle our task must be undertaken wisely and without heedless vindictiveness,1893-Cleveland
when we proclaim that the necessity for revenue to support the government furnishes the only justification for taxing the people we announce a truth so plain that its denial would seem to indicate the extent to which judgment may be influenced by familiarity with perversions of the taxing power,1893-Cleveland
i shall to the best of my ability and within my sphere of duty preserve the constitution by loyally protecting every grant of federal power it contains by defending all its restraints when attacked by impatience and restlessness and by enforcing its limitations and reservations in favor of the states and the people,1893-Cleveland
fellow citizens in obedience to the will of the people and in their presence by the authority vested in me by this oath i assume the arduous and responsible duties of president of the united states relying upon the support of my countrymen and invoking the guidance of almighty god,1897-McKinley
it should all be put upon an enduring basis not subject to easy attack nor its stability to doubt or dispute,1897-McKinley
most of our financial laws are the outgrowth of experience and trial and should not be amended without investigation and demonstration of the wisdom of the proposed changes,1897-McKinley
the experiment is at all events worth a trial and in my opinion it can but prove beneficial to the entire country,1897-McKinley
this was the commanding verdict of the people and it will not be unheeded,1897-McKinley
it has been our uniform practice to retire not increase our outstanding obligations and this policy must again be resumed and vigorously enforced,1897-McKinley
it can only be met by loans or an increased revenue,1897-McKinley
a surplus in the treasury created by loans is not a permanent or safe reliance,1897-McKinley
it is the settled policy of the government pursued from the beginning and practiced by all parties and administrations to raise the bulk of our revenue from taxes upon foreign productions entering the united states for sale and consumption and avoiding for the most part every form of direct taxation except in time of war,1897-McKinley
it is therefore earnestly hoped and expected that congress will at the earliest practicable moment enact revenue legislation that shall be fair reasonable conservative and just and which while supplying sufficient revenue for public purposes will still be signally beneficial and helpful to every section and every enterprise of the people,1897-McKinley
the brief trial given this legislation amply justifies a further experiment and additional discretionary power in the making of commercial treaties the end in view always to be the opening up of new markets for the products of our country by granting concessions to the products of other lands that we need and cannot produce ourselves and which do not involve any loss of labor to our own people but tend to increase their employment,1897-McKinley
legislation helpful to producers is beneficial to all,1897-McKinley
however troublesome the situation may appear congress will not i am sure be found lacking in disposition or ability to relieve it as far as legislation can do so,1897-McKinley
the great essential to our happiness and prosperity is that we adhere to the principles upon which the government was established and insist upon their faithful observance,1897-McKinley
lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the united states courts not mobs must execute the penalties of the law,1897-McKinley
the declaration of the party now restored to power has been in the past that of opposition to all combinations of capital organized in trusts or otherwise to control arbitrarily the condition of trade among our citizens and it has supported such legislation as will prevent the execution of all schemes to oppress the people by undue charges on their supplies or by unjust rates for the transportation of their products to the market,1897-McKinley
illiteracy must be banished from the land if we shall attain that high destiny as the foremost of the enlightened nations of the world which under providence we ought to achieve,1897-McKinley
congress should give prompt attention to the restoration of our american merchant marine once the pride of the seas in all the great ocean highways of commerce,1897-McKinley
the question is one that appeals both to our business necessities and the patriotic aspirations of a great people,1897-McKinley
we want no wars of conquest we must avoid the temptation of territorial aggression,1897-McKinley
since this treaty is clearly the result of our own initiative since it has been recognized as the leading feature of our foreign policy throughout our entire history the adjustment of difficulties by judicial methods rather than force of arms and since it presents to the world the glorious example of reason and peace not passion and war controlling the relations between two of the greatest nations in the world an example certain to be followed by others i respectfully urge the early action of the senate thereon not merely as a matter of policy but as a duty to mankind,1897-McKinley
but a failure to convene the representatives of the people in congress in extra session when it involves neglect of a public duty places the responsibility of such neglect upon the executive himself,1897-McKinley
its members are the agents of the people and their presence at the seat of government in the execution of the sovereign will should not operate as an injury but a benefit,1897-McKinley
our action now will be freer from mere partisan consideration than if the question of tariff revision was postponed until the regular session of congress,1897-McKinley
in view of these considerations i shall deem it my duty as president to convene congress in extraordinary session on monday the 15th day of march 1897,1897-McKinley
let us rejoice in and cultivate this spirit it is ennobling and will be both a gain and a blessing to our beloved country,1897-McKinley
my fellow citizens when we assembled here on the 4th of march 1897 there was great anxiety with regard to our currency and credit,1901-McKinley
now i have the satisfaction to announce that the congress just closed has reduced taxation in the sum of 41 000 000,1901-McKinley
the national verdict of 1896 has for the most part been executed,1901-McKinley
honesty capacity and industry are nowhere more indispensable than in public employment,1901-McKinley
it came,1901-McKinley
i should shrink from the duties this day assumed if i did not feel that in their performance i should have the co operation of the wise and patriotic men of all parties,1901-McKinley
strong hearts and helpful hands are needed and fortunately we have them in every part of our beloved country,1901-McKinley
existing problems demand the thought and quicken the conscience of the country and the responsibility for their presence as well as for their righteous settlement no more upon me than upon you,1901-McKinley
these only becloud they do not help to point the way of safety and honor,1901-McKinley
the american people intrenched in freedom at home take their love for it with them wherever they go and they reject as mistaken and unworthy the doctrine that we lose our own liberties by securing the enduring foundations of liberty to others,1901-McKinley
new things are often found hard to do,1901-McKinley
but are we not made better for the effort and sacrifice and are not those we serve lifted up and blessed,1901-McKinley
they triumphed,1901-McKinley
we adhere to the principle of equality among ourselves and by no act of ours will we assign to ourselves a subordinate rank in the family of nations,1901-McKinley
we face at this moment a most important question that of the future relations of the united states and cuba,1901-McKinley
the transfer of american control to the new government is of such great importance involving an obligation resulting from our intervention and the treaty of peace that i am glad to be advised by the recent act of congress of the policy which the legislative branch of the government deems essential to the best interests of cuba and the united states,1901-McKinley
while the treaty of peace with spain was ratified on the 6th of february 1899 and ratifications were exchanged nearly two years ago the congress has indicated no form of government for the philippine islands,1901-McKinley
the congress having added the sanction of its authority to the powers already possessed and exercised by the executive under the constitution thereby leaving with the executive the responsibility for the government of the philippines i shall continue the efforts already begun until order shall be restored throughout the islands and as fast as conditions permit will establish local governments in the formation of which the full co operation of the people has been already invited and when established will encourage the people to administer them,1901-McKinley
our countrymen should not be deceived,1901-McKinley
they shall not be abandoned,1901-McKinley
my fellow citizens no people on earth have more cause to be thankful than ours and this is said reverently in no spirit of boastfulness in our own strength but with gratitude to the giver of good who has blessed us with the conditions which have enabled us to achieve so large a measure of well being and of happiness,1905-Roosevelt
much has been given us and much will rightfully be expected from us,1905-Roosevelt
but justice and generosity in a nation as in an individual count most when shown not by the weak but by the strong,1905-Roosevelt
our relations with the other powers of the world are important but still more important are our relations among ourselves,1905-Roosevelt
modern life is both complex and intense and the tremendous changes wrought by the extraordinary industrial development of the last half century are felt in every fiber of our social and political being,1905-Roosevelt
there is no good reason why we should fear the future but there is every reason why we should face it seriously neither hiding from ourselves the gravity of the problems before us nor fearing to approach these problems with the unbending unflinching purpose to solve them aright,1905-Roosevelt
they did their work they left us the splendid heritage we now enjoy,1905-Roosevelt
the office of an inaugural address is to give a summary outline of the main policies of the new administration so far as they can be anticipated,1909-Taft
to render the reforms lasting however and to secure at the same time freedom from alarm on the part of those pursuing proper and progressive business methods further legislative and executive action are needed,1909-Taft
it is believed that with the changes to be recommended american business can be assured of that measure of stability and certainty in respect to those things that may be done and those that are prohibited which is essential to the life and growth of all business,1909-Taft
in accordance with the promises of the platform upon which i was elected i shall call congress into extra session to meet on the 15th day of march in order that consideration may be at once given to a bill revising the dingley act,1909-Taft
it is not that the tariff is more important in the long run than the perfecting of the reforms in respect to antitrust legislation and interstate commerce regulation but the need for action when the revision of the tariff has been determined upon is more immediate to avoid embarrassment of business,1909-Taft
it is imperative that such a deficit shall not continue and the framers of the tariff bill must of course have in mind the total revenues likely to be produced by it and so arrange the duties as to secure an adequate income,1909-Taft
the scope of a modern government in what it can and ought to accomplish for its people has been widened far beyond the principles laid down by the old laissez faire school of political writers and this widening has met popular approval,1909-Taft
a permanent improvement like the panama canal should be treated as a distinct enterprise and should be paid for by the proceeds of bonds the issue of which will distribute its cost between the present and future generations in accordance with the benefits derived,1909-Taft
our fortifications are yet in a state of only partial completeness and the number of men to man them is insufficient,1909-Taft
it must be built and in existence when the emergency arises which calls for its use and operation,1909-Taft
but we should be blind to existing conditions and should allow ourselves to become foolish idealists if we did not realize that with all the nations of the world armed and prepared for war we must be ourselves in a similar condition in order to prevent other nations from taking advantage of us and of our inability to defend our interests and assert our rights with a strong hand,1909-Taft
it may maintain them without the slightest danger to the republic or the cause of free institutions and fear of additional taxation ought not to change a proper policy in this regard,1909-Taft
meantime we must take every precaution to prevent or failing that to punish outbursts of race feeling among our people against foreigners of whatever nationality who have by our grant a treaty right to pursue lawful business here and to be protected against lawless assault or injury,1909-Taft
if we would promise we must put ourselves in a position to perform our promise,1909-Taft
there is no subject of economic discussion so intricate and so likely to evoke differing views and dogmatic statements as this one,1909-Taft
the promise to repay by the government will furnish an inducement to savings deposits which private enterprise can not supply and at such a low rate of interest as not to withdraw custom from existing banks,1909-Taft
the direct effect of free trade between this country and the philippines will be marked upon our sales of cottons agricultural machinery and other manufactures,1909-Taft
the work on the canal is making most satisfactory progress,1909-Taft
some type of canal must be constructed,1909-Taft
the governments of our dependencies in porto rico and the philippines are progressing as favorably as could be desired,1909-Taft
i look forward with hope to increasing the already good feeling between the south and the other sections of the country,1909-Taft
the thirteenth amendment secured them freedom the fourteenth amendment due process of law protection of property and the pursuit of happiness and the fifteenth amendment attempted to secure the negro against any deprivation of the privilege to vote because he was a negro,1909-Taft
in time both will come,1909-Taft
there was a time when northerners who sympathized with the negro in his necessary struggle for better conditions sought to give him the suffrage as a protection to enforce its exercise against the prevailing sentiment of the south,1909-Taft
if it had not passed it might be difficult now to adopt it but with it in our fundamental law the policy of southern legislation must and will tend to obey it and so long as the statutes of the states meet the test of this amendment and are not otherwise in conflict with the constitution and laws of the united states it is not the disposition or within the province of the federal government to interfere with the regulation by southern states of their domestic affairs,1909-Taft
they have shown themselves anxious to live for it and to die for it,1909-Taft
therefore the executive in recognizing the negro race by appointments must exercise a careful discretion not thereby to do it more harm than good,1909-Taft
there is one other matter to which i shall refer,1909-Taft
it has also passed a model child labor law for the district of columbia,1909-Taft
another labor question has arisen which has awakened the most excited discussion,1909-Taft
the proposition is usually linked with one to make the secondary boycott lawful,1909-Taft
the american people if i understand them insist that the authority of the courts shall be sustained and are opposed to any change in the procedure by which the powers of a court may be weakened and the fearless and effective administration of justice be interfered with,1909-Taft
the senate about to assemble will also be democratic,1913-Wilson
it means much more than the mere success of a party,1913-Wilson
some new things as we look frankly upon them willing to comprehend their real character have come to assume the aspect of things long believed in and familiar stuff of our own convictions,1913-Wilson
nowhere else in the world have noble men and women exhibited in more striking forms the beauty and the energy of sympathy and helpfulness and counsel in their efforts to rectify wrong alleviate suffering and set the weak in the way of strength and hope,1913-Wilson
we have squandered a great part of what we might have used and have not stopped to conserve the exceeding bounty of nature without which our genius for enterprise would have been worthless and impotent scorning to be careful shamefully prodigal as well as admirably efficient,1913-Wilson
at last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole,1913-Wilson
our thought has been let every man look out for himself let every generation look out for itself while we reared giant machinery which made it impossible that any but those who stood at the levers of control should have a chance to look out for themselves,1913-Wilson
the scales of heedlessness have fallen from our eyes,1913-Wilson
nor have we studied and perfected the means by which government may be put at the service of humanity in safeguarding the health of the nation the health of its men and its women and its children as well as their rights in the struggle for existence,1913-Wilson
society must see to it that it does not itself crush or weaken or damage its own constituent parts,1913-Wilson
it is inconceivable that we should do this as partisans it is inconceivable we should do it in ignorance of the facts as they are or in blind haste,1913-Wilson
the nation has been deeply stirred stirred by a solemn passion stirred by the knowledge of wrong of ideals lost of government too often debauched and made an instrument of evil,1913-Wilson
men s hearts wait upon us men s lives hang in the balance men s hopes call upon us to say what we will do,1913-Wilson
my fellow citizens the four years which have elapsed since last i stood in this place have been crowded with counsel and action of the most vital interest and consequence,1917-Wilson
it speaks for itself and will be of increasing influence as the years go by,1917-Wilson
they have affected the life of the whole world,1917-Wilson
the currents of our thoughts as well as the currents of our trade run quick at all seasons back and forth between us and them,1917-Wilson
we have been deeply wronged upon the seas but we have not wished to wrong or injure in return have retained throughout the consciousness of standing in some sort apart intent upon an interest that transcended the immediate issues of the war itself,1917-Wilson
we may even be drawn on by circumstances not by our own purpose or desire to a more active assertion of our rights as we see them and a more immediate association with the great struggle itself,1917-Wilson
we wish nothing that can be had only at the cost of another people,1917-Wilson
there can be no turning back,1917-Wilson
we have known and boasted all along that they were the principles of a liberated mankind,1917-Wilson
upon this as a platform of purpose and of action we can stand together,1917-Wilson
i stand here and have taken the high and solemn oath to which you have been audience because the people of the united states have chosen me for this august delegation of power and have by their gracious judgment named me their leader in affairs,1917-Wilson
the thing i shall count upon the thing without which neither counsel nor action will avail is the unity of america an america united in feeling in purpose and in its vision of duty of opportunity and of service,1917-Wilson
my countrymen,1921-Harding
surely there must have been god s intent in the making of this new world republic,1921-Harding
let us express renewed and strengthened devotion in grateful reverence for the immortal beginning and utter our confidence in the supreme fulfillment,1921-Harding
our eyes never will be blind to a developing menace our ears never deaf to the call of civilization,1921-Harding
it can enter into no political commitments nor assume any economic obligations which will subject our decisions to any other than our own authority,1921-Harding
we are ready to associate ourselves with the nations of the world great and small for conference for counsel to seek the expressed views of world opinion to recommend a way to approximate disarmament and relieve the crushing burdens of military and naval establishments,1921-Harding
it is not aloofness it is security,1921-Harding
there was no american failure to resist the attempted reversion of civilization there will be no failure today or tomorrow,1921-Harding
because we cherish ideals of justice and peace because we appraise international comity and helpful relationship no less highly than any people of the world we aspire to a high place in the moral leadership of civilization and we hold a maintained america the proven republic the unshaken temple of representative democracy to be not only an inspiration and example but the highest agency of strengthening good will and promoting accord on both continents,1921-Harding
we have not strengthened ours in accordance with our resources or our genius notably on our own continent where a galaxy of republics reflects the glory of new world democracy but in the new order of finance and trade we mean to promote enlarged activities and seek expanded confidence,1921-Harding
when the governments of the earth shall have established a freedom like our own and shall have sanctioned the pursuit of peace as we have practiced it i believe the last sorrow and the final sacrifice of international warfare will have been written,1921-Harding
i would like to hasten them,1921-Harding
out of such universal service will come a new unity of spirit and purpose a new confidence and consecration which would make our defense impregnable our triumph assured,1921-Harding
there has been staggering loss of life and measureless wastage of materials,1921-Harding
we can strike at war taxation and we must,1921-Harding
the business world reflects the disturbance of war s reaction,1921-Harding
our people must give and take,1921-Harding
there is no instant step from disorder to order,1921-Harding
any wild experiment will only add to the confusion,1921-Harding
the call is for productive america to go on,1921-Harding
we count upon her exercise of the full privileges and the performance of the duties of citizenship to speed the attainment of the highest state,1921-Harding
my most reverent prayer for america is for industrial peace with its rewards widely and generally distributed amid the inspirations of equal opportunity,1921-Harding
when world war threatened civilization we pledged our resources and our lives to its preservation and when revolution threatens we unfurl the flag of law and order and renew our consecration,1921-Harding
i would like to acclaim an era of good feeling amid dependable prosperity and all the blessings which attend,1921-Harding
we know full well we cannot sell where we do not buy and we cannot sell successfully where we do not carry,1921-Harding
but pride in things wrought is no reflex of a completed task,1921-Harding
we want an america of homes illumined with hope and happiness where mothers freed from the necessity for long hours of toil beyond their own doors may preside as befits the hearthstone of american citizenship,1921-Harding
where genius has made for great possibilities justice and happiness must be reflected in a greater common welfare,1921-Harding
the world upheaval has added heavily to our tasks,1921-Harding
i accept my part with single mindedness of purpose and humility of spirit and implore the favor and guidance of god in his heaven,1921-Harding
no one can contemplate current conditions without finding much that is satisfying and still more that is encouraging,1925-Coolidge
realizing that we can not live unto ourselves alone we have contributed of our resources and our counsel to the relief of the suffering and the settlement of the disputes among the european nations,1925-Coolidge
it is necessary to keep the former experiences of our country both at home and abroad continually before us if we are to have any science of government,1925-Coolidge
we stand at the opening of the one hundred and fiftieth year since our national consciousness first asserted itself by unmistakable action with an array of force,1925-Coolidge
the narrow fringe of states along the atlantic seaboard advanced its frontiers across the hills and plains of an intervening continent until it passed down the golden slope to the pacific,1925-Coolidge
throughout all these experiences we have enlarged our freedom we have strengthened our independence,1925-Coolidge
but if we wish to continue to be distinctively american we must continue to make that term comprehensive enough to embrace the legitimate desires of a civilized and enlightened people determined in all their relations to pursue a conscientious and religious life,1925-Coolidge
the physical configuration of the earth has separated us from all of the old world but the common brotherhood of man the highest law of all our being has united us by inseparable bonds with all humanity,1925-Coolidge
it has never found that the necessary enjoyment of such a peace could be maintained only by a great and threatening array of arms,1925-Coolidge
removing the burden of expense and jealousy which must always accrue from a keen rivalry is one of the most effective methods of diminishing that unreasonable hysteria and misunderstanding which are the most potent means of fomenting war,1925-Coolidge
america has taken the lead in this new direction and that lead america must continue to hold,1925-Coolidge
i am strongly in favor of continuation of this policy whenever conditions are such that there is even a promise that practical and favorable results might be secured,1925-Coolidge
the weight of our enormous influence must be cast upon the side of a reign not of force but of law and trial not by battle but by reason,1925-Coolidge
we have not failed nor shall we fail to respond whenever necessary to mitigate human suffering and assist in the rehabilitation of distressed nations,1925-Coolidge
but all these plans and preparations these treaties and covenants will not of themselves be adequate,1925-Coolidge
conditions must be provided under which people can make a living and work out of their difficulties,1925-Coolidge
parchment will fail the sword will fail it is only the spiritual nature of man that can be triumphant,1925-Coolidge
our program is never to oppress but always to assist,1925-Coolidge
we can only help those who help themselves,1925-Coolidge
it is not necessary to claim that it has always worked perfectly,1925-Coolidge
unless those who are elected under the same party designation are willing to assume sufficient responsibility and exhibit sufficient loyalty and coherence so that they can cooperate with each other in the support of the broad general principles of the party platform the election is merely a mockery no decision is made at the polls and there is no representation of the popular will,1925-Coolidge
the expression of the popular will in favor of maintaining our constitutional guarantees was overwhelming and decisive,1925-Coolidge
when we turn from what was rejected to inquire what was accepted the policy that stands out with the greatest clearness is that of economy in public expenditure with reduction and reform of taxation,1925-Coolidge
not only those who are now making their tax returns but those who meet the enhanced cost of existence in their monthly bills know by hard experience what this great burden is and what it does,1925-Coolidge
the men and women of this country who toil are the ones who bear the cost of the government,1925-Coolidge
the wisest and soundest method of solving our tax problem is through economy,1925-Coolidge
the only constitutional tax is the tax which ministers to public necessity,1925-Coolidge
whenever taxes become burdensome a remedy can be applied by the people but if they do not act for themselves no one can be very successful in acting for them,1925-Coolidge
those who suffer the most harm will be the poor,1925-Coolidge
that verdict stands,1925-Coolidge
it is not property but the right to hold property both great and small which our constitution guarantees,1925-Coolidge
the result of economic dissipation to a nation is always moral decay,1925-Coolidge
we are not without our problems but our most important problem is not to secure new advantages but to maintain those which we already possess,1925-Coolidge
under a free government the citizen makes his own laws chooses his own administrators which do represent him,1925-Coolidge
our congress represents the people and the states,1925-Coolidge
these are some of the principles which america represents,1925-Coolidge
but the last election showed that appeals to class and nationality had little effect,1925-Coolidge
it is in such contemplations my fellow countrymen which are not exhaustive but only representative that i find ample warrant for satisfaction and encouragement,1925-Coolidge
here it will continue to stand seeking peace and prosperity solicitous for the welfare of the wage earner promoting enterprise developing waterways and natural resources attentive to the intuitive counsel of womanhood encouraging education desiring the advancement of religion supporting the cause of justice and honor among the nations,1925-Coolidge
she cherishes no purpose save to merit the favor of almighty god,1925-Coolidge
our progress if we survey the situation of our nation both at home and abroad we find many satisfactions we find some causes for concern,1929-Hoover
through liberation from widespread poverty we have reached a higher degree of individual freedom than ever before,1929-Hoover
for wise guidance in this great period of recovery the nation is deeply indebted to calvin coolidge,1929-Hoover
confidence in rigid and speedy justice is decreasing,1929-Hoover
many influences had increasingly complicated and weakened our law enforcement organization long before the adoption of the eighteenth amendment,1929-Hoover
its intricate and involved rules of procedure have become the refuge of both big and little criminals,1929-Hoover
it must not come to be in our republic that it can be defeated by the indifference of the citizen by exploitation of the delays and entanglements of the law or by combinations of criminals,1929-Hoover
but a large responsibility rests directly upon our citizens,1929-Hoover
the duty of citizens to support the laws of the land is coequal with the duty of their government to enforce the laws which exist,1929-Hoover
if citizens do not like a law their duty as honest men and women is to discourage its violation their right is openly to work for its repeal,1929-Hoover
its purpose will be to make such recommendations for reorganization of the administration of federal laws and court procedure as may be found desirable,1929-Hoover
self government does not and should not imply the use of political agencies alone,1929-Hoover
there is an equally important field of cooperation by the federal government with the multitude of agencies state municipal and private in the systematic development of those processes which directly affect public health recreation education and the home,1929-Hoover
the nation has marched far beyond that,1929-Hoover
if we would prevent the growth of class distinctions and would constantly refresh our leadership with the ideals of our people we must draw constantly from the general mass,1929-Hoover
the returns are a thousand fold in economic benefits and infinitely more in reduction of suffering and promotion of human happiness,1929-Hoover
those who have a true understanding of america know that we have no desire for territorial expansion for economic or other domination of other peoples,1929-Hoover
they fail to realize that because of our abounding prosperity our youth are pressing more and more into our institutions of learning that our people are seeking a larger vision through art literature science and travel that they are moving toward stronger moral and spiritual life that from these things our sympathies are broadening beyond the bounds of our nation and race toward their true expression in a real brotherhood of man,1929-Hoover
the recent treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy sets an advanced standard in our conception of the relations of nations,1929-Hoover
the permanent court of international justice in its major purpose is thus peculiarly identified with american ideals and with american statesmanship,1929-Hoover
our people have determined that we should make no political engagements such as membership in the league of nations which may commit us in advance as a nation to become involved in the settlements of controversies between other countries,1929-Hoover
they are each of them building a racial character and a culture which is an impressive contribution to human progress,1929-Hoover
it is impossible my countrymen to speak of peace without profound emotion,1929-Hoover
most of these nations have contributed to our race to our culture our knowledge and our progress,1929-Hoover
but it will become a reality only through self restraint and active effort in friendliness and helpfulness,1929-Hoover
but the government is that of the whole people the party is the instrument through which policies are determined and men chosen to bring them into being,1929-Hoover
other mandates from the election it appears to me that the more important further mandates from the recent election were the maintenance of the integrity of the constitution the vigorous enforcement of the laws the continuance of economy in public expenditure the continued regulation of business to prevent domination in the community the denial of ownership or operation of business by the government in competition with its citizens the avoidance of policies which would involve us in the controversies of foreign nations the more effective reorganization of the departments of the federal government the expansion of public works and the promotion of welfare activities affecting education and the home,1929-Hoover
we do know what the attainments of these ideals should be the preservation of self government and its full foundations in local government the perfection of justice whether in economic or in social fields the maintenance of ordered liberty the denial of domination by any group or class the building up and preservation of equality of opportunity the stimulation of initiative and individuality absolute integrity in public affairs the choice of officials for fitness to office the direction of economic progress toward prosperity for the further lessening of poverty the freedom of public opinion the sustaining of education and of the advancement of knowledge the growth of religious spirit and the tolerance of all faiths the strengthening of the home the advancement of peace,1929-Hoover
conclusion this is not the time and place for extended discussion,1929-Hoover
in no nation are the institutions of progress more advanced,1929-Hoover
i have no fears for the future of our country,1929-Hoover
this is preeminently the time to speak the truth the whole truth frankly and boldly,1933-Roosevelt
i am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days,1933-Roosevelt
only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment,1933-Roosevelt
plenty is at our doorstep but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply,1933-Roosevelt
stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership they have resorted to exhortations pleading tearfully for restored confidence,1933-Roosevelt
the measure of the restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit,1933-Roosevelt
small wonder that confidence languishes for it thrives only on honesty on honor on the sacredness of obligations on faithful protection on unselfish performance without them it cannot live,1933-Roosevelt
it can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the government itself treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war but at the same time through this employment accomplishing greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resources,1933-Roosevelt
it can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered uneconomical and unequal,1933-Roosevelt
there are the lines of attack,1933-Roosevelt
i shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment,1933-Roosevelt
it is the strongest assurance that the recovery will endure,1933-Roosevelt
with this pledge taken i assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems,1933-Roosevelt
it is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority may be wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us,1933-Roosevelt
i shall ask the congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe,1933-Roosevelt
we do not distrust the future of essential democracy,1933-Roosevelt
in the spirit of the gift i take it,1933-Roosevelt
we dedicated ourselves to the fulfillment of a vision to speed the time when there would be for all the people that security and peace essential to the pursuit of happiness,1937-Roosevelt
repeated attempts at their solution without the aid of government had left us baffled and bewildered,1937-Roosevelt
we refused to leave the problems of our common welfare to be solved by the winds of chance and the hurricanes of disaster,1937-Roosevelt
today we invoke those same powers of government to achieve the same objectives,1937-Roosevelt
the essential democracy of our nation and the safety of our people depend not upon the absence of power but upon lodging it with those whom the people can change or continue at stated intervals through an honest and free system of elections,1937-Roosevelt
our progress out of the depression is obvious,1937-Roosevelt
old truths have been relearned untruths have been unlearned,1937-Roosevelt
we are beginning to abandon our tolerance of the abuse of power by those who betray for profit the elementary decencies of life,1937-Roosevelt
for these reasons i am justified in believing that the greatest change we have witnessed has been the change in the moral climate of america,1937-Roosevelt
or shall we continue on our way,1937-Roosevelt
timidity asks how difficult is the road ahead,1937-Roosevelt
but our present gains were won under the pressure of more than ordinary circumstances,1937-Roosevelt
such symptoms of prosperity may become portents of disaster,1937-Roosevelt
its hundred and thirty million people are at peace among themselves they are making their country a good neighbor among the nations,1937-Roosevelt
i see millions denied education recreation and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their children,1937-Roosevelt
we are determined to make every american citizen the subject of his country s interest and concern and we will never regard any faithful law abiding group within our borders as superfluous,1937-Roosevelt
they will insist that every agency of popular government use effective instruments to carry out their will,1937-Roosevelt
they will demand a nation uncorrupted by cancers of injustice and therefore strong among the nations in its example of the will to peace,1937-Roosevelt
to maintain a democracy of effort requires a vast amount of patience in dealing with differing methods a vast amount of humility,1937-Roosevelt
on each national day of inauguration since 1789 the people have renewed their sense of dedication to the united states,1941-Roosevelt
if we do not we risk the real peril of inaction,1941-Roosevelt
there are men who believe that democracy as a form of government and a frame of life is limited or measured by a kind of mystical and artificial fate that for some unexplained reason tyranny and slavery have become the surging wave of the future and that freedom is an ebbing tide,1941-Roosevelt
these later years have been living years fruitful years for the people of this democracy,1941-Roosevelt
the bill of rights remains inviolate,1941-Roosevelt
we know it cannot die because it is built on the unhampered initiative of individual men and women joined together in a common enterprise an enterprise undertaken and carried through by the free expression of a free majority,1941-Roosevelt
a nation like a person has a mind a mind that must be kept informed and alert that must know itself that understands the hopes and the needs of its neighbors all the other nations that live within the narrowing circle of the world,1941-Roosevelt
it is the product of centuries,1941-Roosevelt
it blazed anew in the middle ages,1941-Roosevelt
those who first came here to carry out the longings of their spirit and the millions who followed and the stock that sprang from them all have moved forward constantly and consistently toward an ideal which in itself has gained stature and clarity with each generation,1941-Roosevelt
for there is also the spirit,1941-Roosevelt
it speaks to us here in the capital of the nation,1941-Roosevelt
the destiny of america was proclaimed in words of prophecy spoken by our first president in his first inaugural in 1789 words almost directed it would seem to this year of 1941 the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government are justly considered deeply finally staked on the experiment intrusted to the hands of the american people,1941-Roosevelt
we do not retreat,1941-Roosevelt
it is a test of our courage of our resolve of our wisdom our essential democracy,1945-Roosevelt
we shall strive for perfection,1945-Roosevelt
the great fact to remember is that the trend of civilization itself is forever upward that a line drawn through the middle of the peaks and the valleys of the centuries always has an upward trend,1945-Roosevelt
we have learned that we must live as men not as ostriches nor as dogs in the manger,1945-Roosevelt
the almighty god has blessed our land in many ways,1945-Roosevelt
i accept it with a deep resolve to do all that i can for the welfare of this nation and for the peace of the world,1949-Truman
those that confront us now are as momentous as any in the past,1949-Truman
the peoples of the earth face the future with grave uncertainty composed almost equally of great hopes and great fears,1949-Truman
we believe that all men have the right to freedom of thought and expression,1949-Truman
in the pursuit of these aims the united states and other like minded nations find themselves directly opposed by a regime with contrary aims and a totally different concept of life,1949-Truman
democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral and intellectual capacity as well as the inalienable right to govern himself with reason and justice,1949-Truman
democracy has proved that social justice can be achieved through peaceful change,1949-Truman
i state these differences not to draw issues of belief as such but because the actions resulting from the communist philosophy are a threat to the efforts of free nations to bring about world recovery and lasting peace,1949-Truman
we have consistently advocated and relied upon peaceful settlement of disputes among nations,1949-Truman
our efforts have brought new hope to all mankind,1949-Truman
we are moving on with other nations to build an even stronger structure of international order and justice,1949-Truman
we believe that the united nations will be strengthened by the new nations which are being formed in lands now advancing toward self government under democratic principles,1949-Truman
in addition we must carry out our plans for reducing the barriers to world trade and increasing its volume,1949-Truman
we have already established such a defense pact for the western hemisphere by the treaty of rio de janeiro,1949-Truman
in addition we will provide military advice and equipment to free nations which will cooperate with us in the maintenance of peace and security,1949-Truman
their economic life is primitive and stagnant,1949-Truman
but our imponderable resources in technical knowledge are constantly growing and are inexhaustible,1949-Truman
their contributions will be warmly welcomed,1949-Truman
guarantees to the investor must be balanced by guarantees in the interest of the people whose resources and whose labor go into these developments,1949-Truman
greater production is the key to prosperity and peace,1949-Truman
if we are to be successful in carrying out these policies it is clear that we must have continued prosperity in this country and we must keep ourselves strong,1949-Truman
we are aided by all who long for economic security for the security and abundance that men in free societies can enjoy,1949-Truman
they will test our courage our devotion to duty and our concept of liberty,1949-Truman
my friends before i begin the expression of those thoughts that i deem appropriate to this moment would you permit me the privilege of uttering a little private prayer of my own,1953-Eisenhower
may cooperation be permitted and be the mutual aim of those who under the concepts of our constitution hold to differing political faiths so that all may work for the good of our beloved country and thy glory,1953-Eisenhower
this fact defines the meaning of this day,1953-Eisenhower
great nations of europe have fought their bloodiest wars,1953-Eisenhower
we have passed through the anxieties of depression and of war to a summit unmatched in man s history,1953-Eisenhower
we bring all our wit and all our will to meet the question,1953-Eisenhower
this trial comes at a moment when man s power to achieve good or to inflict evil surpasses the brightest hopes and the sharpest fears of all ages,1953-Eisenhower
nations amass wealth,1953-Eisenhower
it is our faith in the deathless dignity of man governed by eternal moral and natural laws,1953-Eisenhower
this faith rules our whole way of life,1953-Eisenhower
it is because we all of us hold to these principles that the political changes accomplished this day do not imply turbulence upheaval or disorder,1953-Eisenhower
whatever defies them they torture especially the truth,1953-Eisenhower
the faith we hold belongs not to us alone but to the free of all the world,1953-Eisenhower
for all our own material might even we need markets in the world for the surpluses of our farms and our factories,1953-Eisenhower
so it is proper that we assure our friends once again that in the discharge of this responsibility we americans know and we observe the difference between world leadership and imperialism between firmness and truculence between a thoughtfully calculated goal and spasmodic reaction to the stimulus of emergencies,1953-Eisenhower
in pleading our just cause before the bar of history and in pressing our labor for world peace we shall be guided by certain fixed principles,1953-Eisenhower
the sole requisites for undertaking such effort are that in their purpose they be aimed logically and honestly toward secure peace for all and that in their result they provide methods by which every participating nation will prove good faith in carrying out its pledge,1953-Eisenhower
4 honoring the identity and the special heritage of each nation in the world we shall never use our strength to try to impress upon another people our own cherished political and economic institutions,1953-Eisenhower
7 appreciating that economic need military security and political wisdom combine to suggest regional groupings of free peoples we hope within the framework of the united nations to help strengthen such special bonds the world over,1953-Eisenhower
8 conceiving the defense of freedom like freedom itself to be one and indivisible we hold all continents and peoples in equal regard and honor,1953-Eisenhower
by their observance an earth of peace may become not a vision but a fact,1953-Eisenhower
we must be willing individually and as a nation to accept whatever sacrifices may be required of us,1953-Eisenhower
moral stamina means more energy and more productivity on the farm and in the factory,1953-Eisenhower
we are summoned to act in wisdom and in conscience to work with industry to teach with persuasion to preach with conviction to weigh our every deed with care and with compassion,1953-Eisenhower
more than a haven for the weary it is a hope for the brave,1953-Eisenhower
before all else we seek upon our common labor as a nation the blessings of almighty god,1957-Eisenhower
may we in our dealings with all peoples of the earth ever speak truth and serve justice,1957-Eisenhower
commerce crowds our rivers and rails our skies harbors and highways,1957-Eisenhower
and for them and so for us this is no time of ease or of rest,1957-Eisenhower
no nation however old or great escapes this tempest of change and turmoil,1957-Eisenhower
the divisive force is international communism and the power that it controls,1957-Eisenhower
yet the world of international communism has itself been shaken by a fierce and mighty force the readiness of men who love freedom to pledge their lives to that love,1957-Eisenhower
we look upon this shaken earth and we declare our firm and fixed purpose the building of a peace with justice in a world where moral law prevails,1957-Eisenhower
we know clearly what we seek and why,1957-Eisenhower
there must be law steadily invoked and respected by all nations for without law the world promises only such meager justice as the pity of the strong upon the weak,1957-Eisenhower
we must use our skills and knowledge and at times our substance to help others rise from misery however far the scene of suffering may be from our shores,1957-Eisenhower
and beyond this general resolve we are called to act a responsible role in the world s great concerns or conflicts whether they touch upon the affairs of a vast region the fate of an island in the pacific or the use of a canal in the middle east,1957-Eisenhower
the unity of all who dwell in freedom is their only sure defense,1957-Eisenhower
we do not fear this world of change,1957-Eisenhower
these hopes that we have helped to inspire we can help to fulfill,1957-Eisenhower
sovereignty is never bartered among freemen,1957-Eisenhower
we do not dread rather do we welcome their progress in education and industry,1957-Eisenhower
thus may the weight of fear and the weight of arms be taken from the burdened shoulders of mankind,1957-Eisenhower
vice president johnson mr speaker mr chief justice president eisenhower vice president nixon president truman reverend clergy fellow citizens we observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom symbolizing an end as well as a beginning signifying renewal as well as change,1961-Kennedy
we dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution,1961-Kennedy
united there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures,1961-Kennedy
to those peoples in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves for whatever period is required not because the communists may be doing it not because we seek their votes but because it is right,1961-Kennedy
and let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house,1961-Kennedy
but neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind s final war,1961-Kennedy
let both sides for the first time formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations,1961-Kennedy
all this will not be finished in the first 100 days,1961-Kennedy
the graves of young americans who answered the call to service surround the globe,1961-Kennedy
i do not shrink from this responsibility i welcome it,1961-Kennedy
finally whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world ask of us the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you,1961-Kennedy
this is the majesty and the meaning of this moment,1965-Johnson
it reminds us that the world will not be the same for our children or even for ourselves m a short span of years,1965-Johnson
conceived in justice written in liberty bound in union it was meant one day to inspire the hopes of all mankind and it binds us still,1965-Johnson
in a land of healing miracles neighbors must not suffer and die unattended,1965-Johnson
but change has given us new weapons,1965-Johnson
it was our bill of rights,1965-Johnson
the american covenant called on us to help show the way for the liberation of man,1965-Johnson
terrific dangers and troubles that we once called foreign now constantly live among us,1965-Johnson
and each of us in the span of time has really only a moment among our companions,1965-Johnson
we aspire to nothing that belongs to others,1965-Johnson
each of us must find a way to advance the purpose of the nation thus finding new purpose for ourselves,1965-Johnson
no longer need capitalist and worker farmer and clerk city and countryside struggle to divide our bounty,1965-Johnson
let us now join reason to faith and action to experience to transform our unity of interest into a unity of purpose,1965-Johnson
we have been allowed by him to seek greatness with the sweat of our hands and the strength of our spirit,1965-Johnson
if we succeed it will not be because of what we have but it will be because of what we are not because of what we own but rather because of what we believe,1965-Johnson
our enemies have always made the same mistake,1965-Johnson
for this is what america is all about,1965-Johnson
is a new world coming,1965-Johnson
for myself i ask only in the words of an ancient leader give me now wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come in before this people for who can judge this thy people that is so great,1965-Johnson
but some stand out as moments of beginning in which courses are set that shape decades or centuries,1969-Nixon
for the first time because the people of the world want peace and the leaders of the world are afraid of war the times are on the side of peace,1969-Nixon
this honor now beckons america the chance to help lead the world at last out of the valley of turmoil and onto that high ground of peace that man has dreamed of since the dawn of civilization,1969-Nixon
we have made enormous strides in science and industry and agriculture,1969-Nixon
i know america s youth,1969-Nixon
standing in this same place a third of a century ago franklin delano roosevelt addressed a nation ravaged by depression and gripped in fear,1969-Nixon
we are torn by division wanting unity,1969-Nixon
when we listen to the better angels of our nature we find that they celebrate the simple things the basic things such as goodness decency love kindness,1969-Nixon
we cannot learn from one another until we stop shouting at one another until we speak quietly enough so that our words can be heard as well as our voices,1969-Nixon
for all of our people we will set as our goal the decent order that makes progress possible and our lives secure,1969-Nixon
the american dream does not come to those who fall asleep,1969-Nixon
to match the magnitude of our tasks we need the energies of our people enlisted not only in grand enterprises but more importantly in those small splendid efforts that make headlines in the neighborhood newspaper instead of the national journal,1969-Nixon
the essence of freedom is that each of us shares in the shaping of his own destiny,1969-Nixon
to go forward at all is to go forward together,1969-Nixon
let us take as our goal where peace is unknown make it welcome where peace is fragile make it strong where peace is temporary make it permanent,1969-Nixon
those who would be our adversaries we invite to a peaceful competition not in conquering territory or extending dominion but in enriching the life of man,1969-Nixon
i have come to know the leaders of the world and the great forces the hatreds the fears that divide the world,1969-Nixon
i know america,1969-Nixon
let this message be heard by strong and weak alike,1969-Nixon
to see the earth as it truly is small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold brothers who know now they are truly brothers,1969-Nixon
our destiny offers not the cup of despair but the chalice of opportunity,1969-Nixon
the central question before us is how shall we use that peace,1973-Nixon
because of america s bold initiatives 1972 will be long remembered as the year of the greatest progress since the end of world war ii toward a lasting peace in the world,1973-Nixon
but let us clearly understand the new nature of america s role as a result of the new policies we have adopted over these past four years,1973-Nixon
but we shall expect others to do their share,1973-Nixon
let us continue to bring down the walls of hostility which have divided the world for too long and to build in their place bridges of understanding so that despite profound differences between systems of government the people of the world can be friends,1973-Nixon
just as building a structure of peace abroad has required turning away from old policies that failed so building a new era of progress at home requires turning away from old policies that have failed,1973-Nixon
abroad and at home the time has come to turn away from the condescending policies of paternalism of washington knows best,1973-Nixon
let us measure what we will do for others by what they will do for themselves,1973-Nixon
government must learn to take less from people so that people an do more for themselves,1973-Nixon
and i pledge to you that where this government should act we will act boldly and we will lead boldly,1973-Nixon
above all else the time has come for us to renew our faith in ourselves and in america,1973-Nixon
america s record in this century has been unparalleled in the world s history for its responsibility for its generosity for its creativity and for its progress,1973-Nixon
we shall answer to god to history and to our conscience for the way in which we use these years,1973-Nixon
let us go forward from here confident in hope strong in our faith in one another sustained by our faith in god who created us and striving always to serve his purpose,1973-Nixon
he hath showed thee o man what is good and what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god,1977-Carter
ours was the first society openly to define itself in terms of both spirituality and of human liberty,1977-Carter
let us learn together and laugh together and work together and pray together confident that in the end we will triumph together in the right,1977-Carter
let our recent mistakes bring a resurgent commitment to the basic principles of our nation for we know that if we despise our own government we have no future,1977-Carter
we reject the prospect of failure or mediocrity or an inferior quality of life for any person,1977-Carter
we cannot afford to do everything nor can we afford to lack boldness as we meet the future,1977-Carter
we will not behave in foreign places so as to violate our rules and standards here at home for we know that the trust which our nation earns is essential to our strength,1977-Carter
we are a strong nation and we will maintain strength so sufficient that it need not be proven in combat a quiet strength based not merely on the size of an arsenal but on the nobility of ideas,1977-Carter
we do not seek to intimidate but it is clear that a world which others can dominate with impunity would be inhospitable to decency and a threat to the well being of all people,1977-Carter
within us the people of the united states there is evident a serious and purposeful rekindling of confidence,1977-Carter
the orderly transfer of authority as called for in the constitution routinely takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few of us stop to think how unique we really are,1981-Reagan
these united states are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions,1981-Reagan
those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity,1981-Reagan
why then should we think that collectively as a nation we are not bound by that same limitation,1981-Reagan
they will go away because we as americans have the capacity now as we have had in the past to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom,1981-Reagan
the solutions we seek must be equitable with no one group singled out to pay a higher price,1981-Reagan
they are in short we the people this breed called americans,1981-Reagan
with the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength we can have a strong and prosperous america at peace with itself and the world,1981-Reagan
it is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed,1981-Reagan
government can and must provide opportunity not smother it foster productivity not stifle it,1981-Reagan
it is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams,1981-Reagan
let us renew our determination our courage and our strength,1981-Reagan
others a handful in number produce enough food to feed all of us and then the world beyond,1981-Reagan
their values sustain our national life,1981-Reagan
how can we love our country and not love our countrymen and loving them reach out a hand when they fall heal them when they are sick and provide opportunities to make them self sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory,1981-Reagan
steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government,1981-Reagan
you are to decide the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn,1981-Reagan
to those neighbors and allies who share our freedom we will strengthen our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment,1981-Reagan
