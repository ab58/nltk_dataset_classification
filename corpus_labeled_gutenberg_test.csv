Utterance,Label
she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate indulgent father and had in consequence of her sister s marriage been mistress of his house from a very early period,austen-emma
the real evils indeed of emma s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments,austen-emma
the wedding over and the bride people gone her father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening,austen-emma
she recalled her past kindness the kindness the affection of sixteen years how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood,austen-emma
he could not meet her in conversation rational or playful,austen-emma
all looked up to them,austen-emma
matrimony as the origin of change was always disagreeable and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter s marrying nor could ever speak of her but with compassion though it had been entirely a match of affection when he was now obliged to part with miss taylor too and from his habits of gentle selfishness and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself he was very much disposed to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield,austen-emma
mr weston is such a good humoured pleasant excellent man that he thoroughly deserves a good wife and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever and bear all my odd humours when she might have a house of her own,austen-emma
my dear how am i to get so far,austen-emma
the carriage,austen-emma
and as for james you may be very sure he will always like going to randalls because of his daughter s being housemaid there,austen-emma
i am very glad i did think of her,austen-emma
he will be able to tell her how we all are,austen-emma
he had returned to a late dinner after some days absence and now walked up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square,austen-emma
not at all sir,austen-emma
look at my shoes,austen-emma
i wanted them to put off the wedding,austen-emma
ah,austen-emma
especially when of those two is such a fanciful troublesome creature,austen-emma
my dearest papa,austen-emma
mr knightley loves to find fault with me you know in a joke it is all a joke,austen-emma
the chances are that she must be a gainer,austen-emma
but mr knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor miss taylor and i am sure she miss her more than she thinks for,austen-emma
and you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said emma and a very considerable one that i made the match myself,austen-emma
pray do not make any more matches,austen-emma
mr weston who had been a widower so long and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here always acceptable wherever he went always cheerful mr weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it,austen-emma
ever since the day about four years ago that miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane when because it began to drizzle he darted away with so much gallantry and borrowed two umbrellas for us from farmer mitchell s i made up my mind on the subject,austen-emma
a worthy employment for a young lady s mind,austen-emma
and have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess i pity you i thought you cleverer for depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck,austen-emma
i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that,austen-emma
only one more papa only for mr elton,austen-emma
mr elton is a very pretty young man to be sure and a very good young man and i have a great regard for him,austen-emma
invite him to dinner emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife,austen-emma
captain weston was a general favourite and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to miss churchill of a great yorkshire family and miss churchill fell in love with him nobody was surprized except her brother and his wife who had never seen him and who were full of pride and importance which the connexion would offend,austen-emma
they lived beyond their income but still it was nothing in comparison of enscombe she did not cease to love her husband but she wanted at once to be the wife of captain weston and miss churchill of enscombe,austen-emma
a complete change of life became desirable,austen-emma
it was now some time since miss taylor had begun to influence his schemes but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase randalls and the sale of randalls was long looked forward to but he had gone steadily on with these objects in view till they were accomplished,austen-emma
his father had no apprehension of it,austen-emma
his coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved,austen-emma
i suppose you have heard of the handsome letter mr frank churchill has written to mrs weston,austen-emma
mrs weston had of course formed a very favourable idea of the young man and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured,austen-emma
but never did she go without mr woodhouse s giving a gentle sigh and saying ah poor miss taylor,austen-emma
what was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body and he had therefore earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding cake at all and when that proved vain as earnestly tried to prevent any body s eating it,austen-emma
chapter iii,austen-emma
not unfrequently through emma s persuasion he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening parties were what he preferred and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week in which emma could not make up a card table for him,austen-emma
she lived with her single daughter in a very small way and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady under such untoward circumstances can excite,austen-emma
and yet she was a happy woman and a woman whom no one named without good will,austen-emma
mrs goddard was the mistress of a school not of a seminary or an establishment or any thing which professed in long sentences of refined nonsense to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality upon new principles and new systems and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity but a real honest old fashioned boarding school where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price and where girls might be sent to be out of the way and scramble themselves into a little education without any danger of coming back prodigies,austen-emma
she was delighted to see her father look comfortable and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated,austen-emma
this was all that was generally known of her history,austen-emma
encouragement should be given,austen-emma
would notice her she would improve her she would detach her from her bad acquaintance and introduce her into good society she would form her opinions and her manners,austen-emma
he loved to have the cloth laid because it had been the fashion of his youth but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat,austen-emma
i would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else but you need not be afraid they are very small you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you,austen-emma
mrs goddard what say you to a glass of wine,austen-emma
miss woodhouse was so great a personage in highbury that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure but the humble grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings delighted with the affability with which miss woodhouse had treated her all the evening and actually shaken hands with her at last,austen-emma
in that respect mrs weston s loss had been important,austen-emma
her early attachment to herself was very amiable and her inclination for good company and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever shewed that there was no want of taste though strength of understanding must not be expected,austen-emma
it was quite a different sort of thing a sentiment distinct and independent,austen-emma
she was ready to tell every thing in her power but on this subject questions were vain,austen-emma
but the martins occupied her thoughts a good deal she had spent two very happy months with them and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place,austen-emma
harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good humoured and obliging,austen-emma
she believed he was very clever and understood every thing,austen-emma
not that she him to marry,austen-emma
you know what you are about,austen-emma
oh yes that is no i do not know but i believe he has read a good deal but not what you would think any thing of,austen-emma
he had never heard of such books before i mentioned them but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can,austen-emma
not handsome not at all handsome,austen-emma
he has passed you very often,austen-emma
but a farmer can need none of my help and is therefore in one sense as much above my notice as in every other he is below it,austen-emma
i know indeed that he is so and as such wish him well,austen-emma
his mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry,austen-emma
well and that is as early as most men can afford to marry who are not born to an independence,austen-emma
they have no indoors man else they do not want for any thing and mrs martin talks of taking a boy another year,austen-emma
but while i visit at hartfield and you are so kind to me miss woodhouse i am not afraid of what any body can do,austen-emma
not that i think mr martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education and been very well brought up,austen-emma
the young man had been the first admirer but she trusted there was no other hold and that there would be no serious difficulty on harriet s side to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own,austen-emma
harriet was not insensible of manner she had voluntarily noticed her father s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder,austen-emma
he did not think we ever walked this road,austen-emma
well miss woodhouse is he like what you expected,austen-emma
i had imagined him i confess a degree or two nearer gentility,austen-emma
do not you begin to feel that now,austen-emma
i see the difference plain enough,austen-emma
what say you to mr weston and mr elton,austen-emma
but mr weston is almost an old man,austen-emma
mr martin is now awkward and abrupt what will he be at mr weston s time of life,austen-emma
that will be very bad,austen-emma
i wonder he did not remember the book was all harriet s answer and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which emma thought might be safely left to itself,austen-emma
they might be more safely held up as a pattern,austen-emma
he seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late,austen-emma
mr elton was the very person fixed on by emma for driving the young farmer out of harriet s head,austen-emma
mr elton s situation was most suitable quite the gentleman himself and without low connexions at the same time not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of harriet,austen-emma
chapter v,austen-emma
you surprize me,austen-emma
knightley,austen-emma
you are so much used to live alone that you do not know the value of a companion and perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex after being used to it all her life,austen-emma
she means it i know,austen-emma
she will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding,austen-emma
emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family,austen-emma
she inherits her mother s talents and must have been under subjection to her,austen-emma
but you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at hartfield,austen-emma
why to own the truth i am afraid you are rather thrown away and that with every disposition to bear there will be nothing to be borne,austen-emma
not i indeed,austen-emma
she knows nothing herself and looks upon emma as knowing every thing,austen-emma
hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than emma altogether face and figure,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
mr knightley is not she,austen-emma
mrs weston i am not to be talked out of my dislike of harriet smith or my dread of its doing them both harm,austen-emma
very well i will not plague you any more,austen-emma
pray excuse me but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it cannot be expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself,austen-emma
be satisfied said he i will not raise any outcry,austen-emma
i wonder what will become of her,austen-emma
i should like to see emma in love and in some doubt of a return it would do her good,austen-emma
there were wishes at randalls respecting emma s destiny but it was not desirable to have them suspected and the quiet transition which mr knightley soon afterwards made to what does weston think of the weather shall we have rain,austen-emma
she had no scruple with regard to him,austen-emma
i am glad you think i have been useful to her but harriet only wanted drawing out and receiving a few very few hints,austen-emma
exactly so that is what principally strikes me,austen-emma
i have no doubt of it,austen-emma
harriet was on the point of leaving the room and only stopt to say with a very interesting naivete,austen-emma
i would give any money for it,austen-emma
it would be such a delight to have her picture,austen-emma
is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers and has not mrs weston some inimitable figure pieces in her drawing room at randalls,austen-emma
well if you give me such kind encouragement mr elton i believe i shall try what i can do,austen-emma
but i am afraid mr elton harriet will not like to sit,austen-emma
yes i observed it i assure you,austen-emma
her many beginnings were displayed,austen-emma
there was merit in every drawing in the least finished perhaps the most her style was spirited but had there been much less or had there been ten times more the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same,austen-emma
there is my father another of my father but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous that i could only take him by stealth neither of them very like therefore,austen-emma
there is my sister and really quite her own little elegant figure and the face not unlike,austen-emma
i took him as he was sleeping on the sofa and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see,austen-emma
then here is my last unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size whole length my last and my best my brother mr john knightley this did not want much of being finished when i put it away in a pet and vowed i would never take another likeness,austen-emma
mr elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea and was repeating no husbands and wives in the case at present indeed as you observe,austen-emma
it was to be a whole length in water colours like mr john knightley s and was destined if she could please herself to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece,austen-emma
if he would be so good as to read to them it would be a kindness indeed,austen-emma
she could not respect his eye but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable,austen-emma
we shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party,austen-emma
do you think so,austen-emma
we must allow for the effect of shade you know,austen-emma
consider she is sitting down which naturally presents a different which in short gives exactly the idea and the proportions must be preserved you know,austen-emma
so prettily done,austen-emma
look at the tree,austen-emma
i cannot keep my eyes from it,austen-emma
his gallantry was always on the alert,austen-emma
mr elton was to take the drawing to london chuse the frame and give the directions and emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough,austen-emma
he is an excellent young man and will suit harriet exactly it will be an exactly so as he says himself but he does sigh and languish and study for compliments rather more than i could endure as a principal,austen-emma
harriet had been at hartfield as usual soon after breakfast and after a time had gone home to return again to dinner she returned and sooner than had been talked of and with an agitated hurried look announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell,austen-emma
yes quite a proposal of marriage and a very good letter at least she thought so,austen-emma
cried harriet,austen-emma
the style of the letter was much above her expectation,austen-emma
yes indeed a very good letter replied emma rather slowly so good a letter harriet that every thing considered i think one of his sisters must have helped him,austen-emma
vigorous decided with sentiments to a certain point not coarse,austen-emma
do you mean with regard to this letter,austen-emma
but what shall i say,austen-emma
there is no danger of your not being intelligible which is the first thing,austen-emma
my dear harriet what do you mean,austen-emma
harriet was silent,austen-emma
pray dear miss woodhouse tell me what i ought to do,austen-emma
for a little while emma persevered in her silence but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful she thought it best to say,austen-emma
but do not imagine that i want to influence you,austen-emma
if you prefer mr martin to every other person if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with why should you hesitate,austen-emma
emma waited the result with impatience but not without strong hopes,austen-emma
while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to myself but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation in approving,austen-emma
now i am secure of you for ever,austen-emma
that would have been too dreadful what an escape dear miss woodhouse i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world,austen-emma
it would have killed me never to come to hartfield any more,austen-emma
however i do really think mr martin a very amiable young man and have a great opinion of him and his being so much attached to me and his writing such a letter but as to leaving you it is what i would not do upon any consideration,austen-emma
emma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass with a very true and it would be a small consolation to her for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day to know that her husband could write a good letter,austen-emma
but how shall i do,austen-emma
the business was finished and harriet safe,austen-emma
and i am sure i should never want to go there for i am never happy but at hartfield,austen-emma
even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes,austen-emma
the idea of mr elton was certainly cheering but still after a time she was tender hearted again towards the rejected mr martin,austen-emma
at this moment perhaps mr elton is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters telling how much more beautiful is the original and after being asked for it five or six times allowing them to hear your name your own dear name,austen-emma
it opens his designs to his family it introduces you among them it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature eager curiosity and warm prepossession,austen-emma
for some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there and gradually getting to have a bed room appropriated to herself and emma judged it best in every respect safest and kindest to keep her with them as much as possible just at present,austen-emma
as the sun is out i believe i had better take my three turns while i can,austen-emma
emma will be happy to entertain you,austen-emma
i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you,austen-emma
i am glad you think so and the good hands i hope may not be wanting,austen-emma
do not often overpower me with it,austen-emma
highbury gossips tiresome wretches,austen-emma
indeed,austen-emma
i can think of but one thing who is in love with her,austen-emma
her visit to abbey mill this summer seems to have done his business,austen-emma
he came to the abbey two evenings ago on purpose to consult me about it,austen-emma
he always speaks to the purpose open straightforward and very well judging,austen-emma
i praised the fair lady too and altogether sent him away very happy,austen-emma
certainly replied he surprized i do not absolutely know it but it may be inferred,austen-emma
then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her,austen-emma
nonsense,austen-emma
i saw her answer nothing could be clearer,austen-emma
mr martin is a very respectable young man but i cannot admit him to be harriet s equal and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her,austen-emma
emma your infatuation about that girl blinds you,austen-emma
she has been taught nothing useful and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself,austen-emma
but i could not reason so to a man in love and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her to her having that sort of disposition which in good hands like his might be easily led aright and turn out very well,austen-emma
i cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of emma as to say any such thing,austen-emma
i assure you mine are very different,austen-emma
as to the circumstances of her birth though in a legal sense she may be called nobody it will not hold in common sense,austen-emma
she desired nothing better herself,austen-emma
you have been no friend to harriet smith emma,austen-emma
depend upon it he had encouragement,austen-emma
waiving that point however and supposing her to be as you describe her only pretty and good natured let me tell you that in the degree she possesses them they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general for she is in fact a beautiful girl and must be thought so by ninety nine people out of an hundred and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed till they do fall in love with well informed minds instead of handsome faces a girl with such loveliness as harriet has a certainty of being admired and sought after of having the power of chusing from among many consequently a claim to be nice,austen-emma
to be sure,austen-emma
harriet may pick and chuse,austen-emma
you will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty and of what she has a claim to that in a little while nobody within her reach will be good enough for her,austen-emma
men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed,austen-emma
she must abide by the evil of having refused him whatever it may be and as to the refusal itself i will not pretend to say that i might not influence her a little but i assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do,austen-emma
she knows now what gentlemen are and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with harriet,austen-emma
she did not repent what she had done she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general which made her dislike having it so loudly against her and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state was very disagreeable,austen-emma
your views for harriet are best known to yourself but as you make no secret of your love of match making it is fair to suppose that views and plans and projects you have and as a friend i shall just hint to you that if elton is the man i think it will be all labour in vain,austen-emma
he knows the value of a good income as well as any body,austen-emma
i am very much obliged to you said emma laughing again,austen-emma
good morning to you said he rising and walking off abruptly,austen-emma
he walked off in more complete self approbation than he left for her,austen-emma
he had frightened her a little about mr elton but when she considered that mr knightley could not have observed him as she had done neither with the interest nor she must be allowed to tell herself in spite of mr knightley s pretensions with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself that he had spoken it hastily and in anger she was able to believe that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true than what he knew any thing about,austen-emma
mr perry had been to mrs goddard s to attend a sick child and miss nash had seen him and he had told miss nash that as he was coming back yesterday from clayton park he had met mr elton and found to his great surprize that mr elton was actually on his road to london and not meaning to return till the morrow though it was the whist club night which he had been never known to miss before and mr perry had remonstrated with him about it and told him how shabby it was in him their best player to absent himself and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day but it would not do mr elton had been determined to go on and had said in a way indeed that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world and something about a very enviable commission and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious,austen-emma
he was so much displeased that it was longer than usual before he came to hartfield again and when they did meet his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven,austen-emma
her views of improving her little friend s mind by a great deal of useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more than a few first chapters and the intention of going on to morrow,austen-emma
mr woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in,austen-emma
it was by no means his daughter s wish that the intellects of highbury in general should be put under requisition,austen-emma
made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already,austen-emma
he had never written hardly ever any thing of the kind in his life,austen-emma
i do not offer it for miss smith s collection said he,austen-emma
take it said emma smiling and pushing the paper towards harriet it is for you,austen-emma
my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings lords of the earth,austen-emma
man s boasted power and freedom all are flown lord of the earth and sea he bends a slave and woman lovely woman reigns alone,austen-emma
i give you credit for it,austen-emma
harriet exactly,austen-emma
a man must be very much in love indeed to describe her so,austen-emma
and very much to the purpose,austen-emma
what can it possibly be,austen-emma
i wonder who the friend was and who could be the young lady,austen-emma
behold him there the monarch of the seas,austen-emma
shark is only one syllable,austen-emma
nonsense,austen-emma
my first displays the wealth and pomp of kings lords of the earth,austen-emma
but ah,austen-emma
read it in comfort to yourself,austen-emma
but she was not wanted to speak,austen-emma
i thought it must be so,austen-emma
i am very happy,austen-emma
this harriet is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us,austen-emma
it is so much beyond any thing i deserve,austen-emma
dear me how clever could it really be meant for me,austen-emma
it is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected,austen-emma
there does seem to be a something in the air of hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow,austen-emma
his company so sought after that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it that he has more invitations than there are days in the week,austen-emma
how little did i think the two abbots and i ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by and miss nash came and scolded us away and staid to look through herself however she called me back presently and let me look too which was very good natured,austen-emma
if they are anxious to see you married here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in here it will be accomplished and if their only object is that you should in the common phrase be married here is the comfortable fortune the respectable establishment the rise in the world which must satisfy them,austen-emma
this charade if i had studied a twelvemonth i could never have made any thing like it,austen-emma
i do not consider its length as particularly in its favour,austen-emma
emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of mr martin s prose,austen-emma
you do nothing,austen-emma
i am sure i have not got one half so good,austen-emma
granted for private enjoyment and for private enjoyment keep them,austen-emma
a poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities or neither,austen-emma
very well replied emma a most natural feeling and the longer it lasts the better i shall be pleased,austen-emma
harriet looked grave,austen-emma
he has encouragement enough to proceed without our sighing out our souls over this charade,austen-emma
yes papa we have something to read you something quite fresh,austen-emma
woman lovely woman,austen-emma
your dear mother was so clever at all those things,austen-emma
but i think my dear you said you had got it,austen-emma
kitty a fair but frozen maid,austen-emma
yes she will have her own room of course the room she always has and there is the nursery for the children just as usual you know,austen-emma
i do not know my dear,austen-emma
it is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer but it seems a case of necessity,austen-emma
he sat musing a little while and then said,austen-emma
papa that is what you never have been able to accomplish and i do not think you ever will,austen-emma
i am sure she will be pleased with the children,austen-emma
they are very fond of being at hartfield harriet,austen-emma
john the second is named after his father,austen-emma
and once henry asked me for a knife but i told him knives were only made for grandpapas,austen-emma
and then their uncle comes in and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way,austen-emma
one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other,austen-emma
emma thanked him but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account her father was sure of his rubber,austen-emma
your friend will not take it amiss i hope,austen-emma
you must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two,austen-emma
she ran away to indulge the inclination leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to harriet s share,austen-emma
it had no advantage of situation but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor and such as it was there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes emma s remark was,austen-emma
i do not often walk this way said emma as they proceeded but there will be an inducement and i shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges gates pools and pollards of this part of highbury,austen-emma
i do so wonder miss woodhouse that you should not be married or going to be married,austen-emma
and i am not only not going to be married at present but have very little intention of ever marrying at all,austen-emma
if i were to marry i must expect to repent it,austen-emma
but i never have been in love it is not my way or my nature and i do not think i ever shall,austen-emma
so silly so satisfied so smiling so prosing so undistinguishing and unfastidious and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me i would marry to morrow,austen-emma
a single woman with a very narrow income must be a ridiculous disagreeable old maid,austen-emma
poverty certainly has not contracted her mind i really believe if she had only a shilling in the world she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it and nobody is afraid of her that is a great charm,austen-emma
woman s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now or with no important variation,austen-emma
my nephews and nieces i shall often have a niece with me,austen-emma
by the bye is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece,austen-emma
i wish jane fairfax very well but she tires me to death,austen-emma
these are the sights harriet to do one good,austen-emma
and really i do not think the impression will soon be over said emma as she crossed the low hedge and tottering footstep which ended the narrow slippery path through the cottage garden and brought them into the lane again,austen-emma
the lane made a slight bend and when that bend was passed mr elton was immediately in sight and so near as to give emma time only to say farther,austen-emma
harriet could just answer oh,austen-emma
mr elton then turned back to accompany them,austen-emma
anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath a little raised on one side of the lane leaving them together in the main road,austen-emma
she gained on them however involuntarily the child s pace was quick and theirs rather slow and she was the more concerned at it from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them,austen-emma
they now walked on together quietly till within view of the vicarage pales when a sudden resolution of at least getting harriet into the house made her again find something very much amiss about her boot and fall behind to arrange it once more,austen-emma
mr elton looked all happiness at this proposition and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage,austen-emma
it could be protracted no longer,austen-emma
he had been most agreeable most delightful he had told harriet that he had seen them go by and had purposely followed them other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt but nothing serious,austen-emma
it was no longer in emma s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures,austen-emma
mr and mrs john knightley from having been longer than usual absent from surry were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest,austen-emma
she could never see a fault in any of them,austen-emma
the extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his,austen-emma
perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to isabella s sister but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend without praise and without blindness but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into the want of respectful forbearance towards her father,austen-emma
they had not been long seated and composed when mr woodhouse with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh called his daughter s attention to the sad change at hartfield since she had been there last,austen-emma
mr john knightley here asked emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of randalls,austen-emma
very much to the honour of both was the handsome reply,austen-emma
papa we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married,austen-emma
every body must be aware that miss taylor must be missed but every body ought also to be assured that mr and mrs weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth,austen-emma
it would be very hard upon mr weston if she did not papa you quite forget poor mr,austen-emma
as for isabella she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the mr westons aside as much as she can,austen-emma
where is the young man,austen-emma
but you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father,austen-emma
he is but young and his uncle perhaps,austen-emma
however it was an exceeding good pretty letter and gave mr and mrs weston a great deal of pleasure,austen-emma
i have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man,austen-emma
i really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else,austen-emma
she would keep the peace if possible and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits the all sufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brother s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse and those to whom it was important it had a high claim to forbearance,austen-emma
she thought it was time to make up,austen-emma
emma felt they were friends again and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction and then a little sauciness she could not help saying as he was admiring the baby,austen-emma
yes said he smiling and reason good,austen-emma
i have still the advantage of you by sixteen years experience and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child,austen-emma
be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited,austen-emma
ah indeed i am very sorry come shake hands with me,austen-emma
the brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits but principally of those of the elder whose temper was by much the most communicative and who was always the greater talker,austen-emma
and how tired you must be after your journey,austen-emma
it was an awkward business my dear your spending the autumn at south end instead of coming here,austen-emma
my dear but perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good and as to myself i have been long perfectly convinced though perhaps i never told you so before that the sea is very rarely of use to any body,austen-emma
my dear isabella i have not heard you make one inquiry about mr perry yet and he never forgets you,austen-emma
i suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere,austen-emma
i hope he will be calling soon,austen-emma
my dear sir her throat is so much better that i have hardly any uneasiness about it,austen-emma
the good bateses i am quite ashamed of myself but you mention them in most of your letters,austen-emma
how sorry i am,austen-emma
perry does not call it altogether a sickly season,austen-emma
it is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there,austen-emma
we are so very airy,austen-emma
you make the best of it but after you have been a week at hartfield you are all of you different creatures you do not look like the same,austen-emma
middling my dear i cannot compliment you,austen-emma
i could have wished however as you know that you had seen mr wingfield before you left home,austen-emma
will not the old prejudice be too strong,austen-emma
i always regret excessively on dear emma s account that she cannot be more at highbury but now their daughter is married i suppose colonel and mrs campbell will not be able to part with her at all,austen-emma
emma could not have a better companion than harriet,austen-emma
here was a dangerous opening,austen-emma
and for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel,austen-emma
south end is an unhealthy place,austen-emma
and by what i understand you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea a quarter of a mile off very comfortable,austen-emma
this is just what perry said,austen-emma
perry i want his directions no more than his drugs,austen-emma
,austen-emma
mr woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend perry to whom he had in fact though unconsciously been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil and the immediate alertness of one brother and better recollections of the other prevented any renewal of it,austen-emma
in general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings but one complete dinner engagement and out of the house too there was no avoiding though at christmas,austen-emma
emma called on her the next day and found her doom already signed with regard to randalls,austen-emma
emma was just describing the nature of her friend s complaint a throat very much inflamed with a great deal of heat about her a quick low pulse c and she was sorry to find from mrs goddard that harriet was liable to very bad sore throats and had often alarmed her with them,austen-emma
indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend,austen-emma
but upon my word mr elton in your case i should certainly excuse myself,austen-emma
but hardly had she so spoken when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage if the weather were mr elton s only objection and mr elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction,austen-emma
soon afterwards mr elton quitted them and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming harriet at parting in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at mrs goddard s for news of her fair friend the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again when he hoped to be able to give a better report and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour,austen-emma
mr elton s manners are not perfect replied emma but where there is a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook a great deal,austen-emma
she replied with a smile of astonishment are you imagining me to be mr elton s object,austen-emma
i speak as a friend emma,austen-emma
mr woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit that in spite of the increasing coldness he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others too full of the wonder of his own going and the pleasure it was to afford at randalls to see that it was cold and too well wrapt up to feel it,austen-emma
he must think himself a most agreeable fellow i could not do such a thing,austen-emma
she could not be complying she dreaded being quarrelsome her heroism reached only to silence,austen-emma
she had sent while dressing and the answer had been much the same not better,austen-emma
very much grieved and concerned i had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as i knew had been given her in the morning,austen-emma
but it is impossible not to feel uneasiness,austen-emma
what an excellent device said he the use of a sheepskin for carriages,austen-emma
it is a very cold afternoon but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter ha,austen-emma
this is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings,austen-emma
mr john knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure but said only coolly,austen-emma
charming people mr and mrs weston mrs weston indeed is much beyond praise and he is exactly what one values so hospitable and so fond of society it will be a small party but where small parties are select they are perhaps the most agreeable of any,austen-emma
in a tone of wonder and pity i had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery,austen-emma
mr elton must smile less and mr john knightley more to fit them for the place emma only might be as nature prompted and shew herself just as happy as she was,austen-emma
the misfortune of harriet s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival,austen-emma
can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from harriet to me absurd and insufferable,austen-emma
she had frequently thought especially since his father s marriage with miss taylor that if she to marry he was the very person to suit her in age character and condition,austen-emma
weston so it proved for when happily released from mr elton and seated by mr weston at dinner he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton to say to her,austen-emma
emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure and fully assented to his proposition of mr frank churchill and miss smith making their party quite complete,austen-emma
and mrs weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him that she must be almost as happy as yourself,austen-emma
if they are not put off he cannot stir,austen-emma
if you think he will come i shall think so too for you know enscombe,austen-emma
i cannot be so sanguine as mr weston,austen-emma
replied mrs weston smiling what is the certainty of caprice,austen-emma
oh mrs churchill every body knows mrs churchill replied isabella and i am sure i never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion,austen-emma
emma wished she had been alone with mrs weston,austen-emma
neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him and gladly did he move to those with whom he was always comfortable,austen-emma
yes and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays,austen-emma
in short i can feel no dependence on his coming and i wish mr weston were less sanguine,austen-emma
one ought to use the same caution perhaps in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family but enscombe i believe certainly must not be judged by general rules is so very unreasonable and every thing gives way to her,austen-emma
emma listened and then coolly said i shall not be satisfied unless he comes,austen-emma
mr elton in very good spirits was one of the first to walk in,austen-emma
did she know had she heard any thing about her since their being at randalls he felt much anxiety he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably,austen-emma
it did appear there was no concealing it exactly like the pretence of being in love with her instead of harriet an inconstancy if real the most contemptible and abominable,austen-emma
she wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to day and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself,austen-emma
emma saw mrs weston s surprize and felt that it must be great at an address which in words and manner was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her and as for herself she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose,austen-emma
poor mr woodhouse was silent from consternation but every body else had something to say every body was either surprized or not surprized and had some question to ask or some comfort to offer,austen-emma
another hour or two s snow can hardly make the road impassable and we are two carriages if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand,austen-emma
what is to be done my dear emma what is to be done,austen-emma
you had better order the carriage directly my love said she i dare say we shall be able to get along if we set off directly and if we do come to any thing very bad i can get out and walk,austen-emma
replied he,austen-emma
mrs weston could only approve,austen-emma
he was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay and while the others were variously urging and recommending mr knightley and emma settled it in a few brief sentences thus,austen-emma
and the bell was rung and the carriages spoken for,austen-emma
and there would be poor emma in the carriage behind,austen-emma
but now she would rather it had not happened,austen-emma
she tried to stop him but vainly he would go on and say it all,austen-emma
this to,austen-emma
and i can account for it only in one way you are not yourself or you could not speak either to me or of harriet in such a manner,austen-emma
it is impossible for me to doubt any longer,austen-emma
good heaven,austen-emma
no upon my honour there is no unsteadiness of character,austen-emma
no in an accent meant to be insinuating i am sure you have seen and understood me,austen-emma
it confesses that you have long understood me,austen-emma
never madam cried he affronted in his turn never i assure you,austen-emma
i have seen you only as the admirer of my friend,austen-emma
i have no thoughts of matrimony at present,austen-emma
there she was welcomed with the utmost delight by her father who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from vicarage lane turning a corner which he could never bear to think of and in strange hands a mere common coachman no james and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well for mr john knightley ashamed of his ill humour was now all kindness and attention and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father as to seem if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party except herself but her mind had never been in such perturbation and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection,austen-emma
he might have doubled his presumption to me but poor harriet,austen-emma
the picture how eager he had been about the picture and the charade and an hundred other circumstances how clearly they had seemed to point at harriet,austen-emma
there was no denying that those brothers had penetration,austen-emma
she thought nothing of his attachment and was insulted by his hopes,austen-emma
he only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself and if miss woodhouse of hartfield the heiress of thirty thousand pounds were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied he would soon try for miss somebody else with twenty or with ten,austen-emma
the landed property of hartfield certainly was inconsiderable being but a sort of notch in the donwell abbey estate to which all the rest of highbury belonged but their fortune from other sources was such as to make them scarcely secondary to donwell abbey itself in every other kind of consequence and the woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which mr elton had first entered not two years ago to make his way as he could without any alliances but in trade or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility but he had fancied her in love with him that evidently must have been his dependence and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging so full of courtesy and attention as supposing her real motive unperceived might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy like mr elton in fancying himself a very decided favourite,austen-emma
she was quite concerned and ashamed and resolved to do such things no more,austen-emma
there i was quite right,austen-emma
no i could not endure william coxe a pert young lawyer,austen-emma
emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her and to depend on getting tolerably out of it,austen-emma
the ground covered with snow and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise every morning beginning in rain or snow and every evening setting in to freeze she was for many days a most honourable prisoner,austen-emma
elton,austen-emma
mr and mrs john knightley were not detained long at hartfield,austen-emma
she admired him for contriving it though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced,austen-emma
mr woodhouse talked over his alarms and emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude,austen-emma
harriet bore the intelligence very well blaming nobody and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend,austen-emma
it was rather too late in the day to set about being simple minded and ignorant but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet and repressing imagination all the rest of her life,austen-emma
if mr elton on his return made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do she could not imagine harriet s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him,austen-emma
where the wound had been given there must the cure be found if anywhere and emma felt that till she saw her in the way of cure there could be no true peace for herself,austen-emma
mrs weston was exceedingly disappointed much more disappointed in fact than her husband though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober but a sanguine temper though for ever expecting more good than occurs does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression,austen-emma
the acquaintance at present had no charm for her,austen-emma
i do not know why you should say so,austen-emma
what has mr frank churchill done to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature,austen-emma
it is impossible,austen-emma
he cannot want money he cannot want leisure,austen-emma
yes sometimes he can,austen-emma
he may at times be able to do a great deal more than he can at others,austen-emma
i know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion,austen-emma
but you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own,austen-emma
they would feel that they could trust him that the nephew who had done rightly by his father would do rightly by them for they know as well as he does as well as all the world must know that he ought to pay this visit to his father and while meanly exerting their power to delay it are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims,austen-emma
i can imagine that if you as you are mr knightley were to be transported and placed all at once in mr frank churchill s situation you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him and it might have a very good effect,austen-emma
if it failed to produce equal exertion it could not be an equal conviction,austen-emma
i can allow for the fears of the child but not of the man,austen-emma
i have not the least idea of his being a weak young man i feel sure that he is not,austen-emma
his letters disgust me,austen-emma
it is on her account that attention to randalls is doubly due and she must doubly feel the omission,austen-emma
he may be very aimable have very good manners and be very agreeable but he can have no english delicacy towards the feelings of other people nothing really amiable about him,austen-emma
we do not often look upon fine young men well bred and agreeable,austen-emma
if i find him conversable i shall be glad of his acquaintance but if he is only a chattering coxcomb he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts,austen-emma
at three and twenty to be the king of his company the great man the practised politician who is to read every body s character and make every body s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority to be dispensing his flatteries around that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself,austen-emma
i am not prejudiced,austen-emma
volume ii,austen-emma
they were just approaching the house where lived mrs and miss bates,austen-emma
the house belonged to people in business,austen-emma
this she had been prepared for when she entered the house but meant having once talked him handsomely over to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic and to wander at large amongst all the mistresses and misses of highbury and their card parties,austen-emma
and so she began inquiring after her directly saying i know you cannot have heard from jane lately because it is not her time for writing and when i immediately said but indeed we have we had a letter this very morning i do not know that i ever saw any body more surprized,austen-emma
have you heard from miss fairfax so lately,austen-emma
replied the happily deceived aunt while eagerly hunting for the letter oh,austen-emma
she often says when the letter is first opened well hetty now i think you will be put to it to make out all that checker work don t you ma am and then i tell her i am sure she would contrive to make it out herself if she had nobody to do it for her every word of it i am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word,austen-emma
jane often says when she is here i am sure grandmama you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do and so much fine work as you have done too i only wish my eyes may last me as well,austen-emma
ma am addressing her do you hear what miss woodhouse is so obliging to say about jane s handwriting,austen-emma
but it is very remarkable that she should always hear jane better than she does me,austen-emma
oh yes next week,austen-emma
every body is so surprized and every body says the same obliging things,austen-emma
oh yes friday or saturday next,austen-emma
so obliging of you,austen-emma
mrs dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly,austen-emma
at this moment an ingenious and animating suspicion entering emma s brain with regard to jane fairfax this charming mr dixon and the not going to ireland she said with the insidious design of farther discovery,austen-emma
the very thing that we have always been rather afraid of for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us for months together not able to come if any thing was to happen,austen-emma
but ever since we had the history of that day i have been so fond of mr,austen-emma
i am concerned to hear of it,austen-emma
no,austen-emma
jane caught a bad cold poor thing,austen-emma
so considerate but however she is so far from well that her kind friends the campbells think she had better come home and try an air that always agrees with her and they have no doubt that three or four months at highbury will entirely cure her and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here than go to ireland if she is unwell,austen-emma
if it was not for the drawback of her illness but i am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin and looking very poorly,austen-emma
which my mother being on the watch heard distinctly and was sadly alarmed at,austen-emma
he has a wife and family to maintain and is not to be giving away his time,austen-emma
now however we must wish you and mrs bates good morning,austen-emma
the marriage of lieut,austen-emma
these were claims which he did not learn to overlook though some years passed away from the death of poor fairfax before his own return to england put any thing in his power,austen-emma
to provide for her otherwise was out of colonel campbell s power for though his income by pay and appointments was handsome his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter s but by giving her an education he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter,austen-emma
neither father nor mother could promote and the daughter could not endure it,austen-emma
they continued together with unabated regard however till the marriage of miss campbell who by that chance that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior engaged the affections of mr dixon a young man rich and agreeable almost as soon as they were acquainted and was eligibly and happily settled while jane fairfax had yet her bread to earn,austen-emma
as long as they lived no exertions would be necessary their home might be hers for ever and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly but this would be selfishness what must be at last had better be soon,austen-emma
it was her own choice to give the time of their absence to highbury to spend perhaps her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear and the campbells whatever might be their motive or motives whether single or double or treble gave the arrangement their ready sanction and said that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air for the recovery of her health than on any thing else,austen-emma
these were her reasons she had no better,austen-emma
her eyes a deep grey with dark eye lashes and eyebrows had never been denied their praise but the skin which she had been used to cavil at as wanting colour had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom,austen-emma
in that case nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on,austen-emma
these were charming feelings but not lasting,austen-emma
they had music emma was obliged to play and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour an air of greatness meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance,austen-emma
if any thing could be more where all was most she was more reserved on the subject of weymouth and the dixons than any thing,austen-emma
emma saw its artifice and returned to her first surmises,austen-emma
was he handsome,austen-emma
at a watering place or in a common london acquaintance it was difficult to decide on such points,austen-emma
emma could not forgive her but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by mr knightley who had been of the party and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side he was expressing the next morning being at hartfield again on business with mr woodhouse his approbation of the whole not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to emma,austen-emma
i am sure miss fairfax must have found the evening pleasant emma,austen-emma
there is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are,austen-emma
an arch look expressed i understand you well enough but she said only miss fairfax is reserved,austen-emma
my dear emma said he moving from his chair into one close by her you are not going to tell me i hope that you had not a pleasant evening,austen-emma
i had,austen-emma
she must have found the evening agreeable mr knightley because she had emma,austen-emma
mr knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express and before he could make any reply mr woodhouse whose thoughts were on the bates s said,austen-emma
i knew you would wish it,austen-emma
emma said mr knightley presently i have a piece of news for you,austen-emma
what is it why do you smile so where did you hear it at randalls,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
have you heard the news,austen-emma
cried miss bates,austen-emma
my dear said i well and just then came the note,austen-emma
a miss hawkins,austen-emma
my dear sir you really are too bountiful,austen-emma
if ever there were people who without having great wealth themselves had every thing they could wish for i am sure it is us,austen-emma
he had been so fortunate as to i forget the precise words one has no business to remember them,austen-emma
he will have every body s wishes for his happiness,austen-emma
a new neighbour for us all miss woodhouse,austen-emma
jane s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her,austen-emma
when you have been here a little longer miss fairfax you will understand that mr elton is the standard of perfection in highbury both in person and mind,austen-emma
jane says that colonel campbell is a little deaf,austen-emma
now here will be mr elton and miss hawkins and there are the coles such very good people and the perrys i suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than mr and mrs perry,austen-emma
he has been gone only four weeks,austen-emma
and as it is some months since miss campbell married the impression may be a little worn off,austen-emma
she knows i would not offend for the world,austen-emma
those dear little children,austen-emma
but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand,austen-emma
no far from it certainly plain,austen-emma
where i have a regard i always think a person well looking,austen-emma
this has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
it was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news as proving that mr elton could not have suffered long but she was sorry for harriet harriet must feel it and all that she could hope was by giving the first information herself to save her from hearing it abruptly from others,austen-emma
which instantly burst forth had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation,austen-emma
i thought i should have fainted,austen-emma
i am sure i must have been as white as my gown,austen-emma
she did not do any of it in the same way that she used i could see she was altered but however she seemed to to be very friendly and we shook hands and stood talking some time but i know no more what i said i was in such a tremble i remember she said she was sorry we never met now which i thought almost too kind,austen-emma
so i said i was very much obliged to him you know i could not do less and then he went back to elizabeth and i came round by the stables i believe i did but i hardly knew where i was or any thing about it,austen-emma
miss woodhouse do talk to me and make me comfortable again,austen-emma
as harriet described it there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour,austen-emma
they might all have hoped to rise by harriet s acquaintance and besides what was the value of harriet s description so easily pleased so little discerning what signified her praise,austen-emma
though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before or an hour before its interest soon increased and before their first conversation was over she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity wonder and regret pain and pleasure as to this fortunate miss hawkins which could conduce to place the martins under proper subordination in her fancy,austen-emma
human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations that a young person who either marries or dies is sure of being kindly spoken of,austen-emma
he came back gay and self satisfied eager and busy caring nothing for miss woodhouse and defying miss smith,austen-emma
she was in fact beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings that except in a moral light as a penance a lesson a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again,austen-emma
it would be almost beginning their life of civility again,austen-emma
she was must be uncertain but she was might be found out and setting aside the 10 000 l it did not appear that she was at all harriet s superior,austen-emma
and all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister who was to a gentleman in a near bristol who kept two carriages,austen-emma
the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harriet s mind was not to be talked away,austen-emma
she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other,austen-emma
sometimes mr elton predominated sometimes the martins and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other,austen-emma
while he staid the martins were forgotten and on the very morning of his setting off for bath again emma to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned judged it best for her to return elizabeth martin s visit,austen-emma
she meant to take her in the carriage leave her at the abbey mill while she drove a little farther and call for her again so soon as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future,austen-emma
she went however and when they reached the farm and she was to be put down at the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led between espalier apple trees to the front door the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before was beginning to revive a little local agitation and when they parted emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour,austen-emma
she was feeling too much but at last emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting and the sort of pain it was creating,austen-emma
had done it,austen-emma
she would have given a great deal or endured a great deal to have had the martins in a higher rank of life,austen-emma
it was a good scheme but on driving to the door they heard that neither master nor mistress was at home they had both been out some time the man believed they were gone to hartfield,austen-emma
there was instant pleasure in the sight of them and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound for mr weston immediately accosted her with,austen-emma
there was no resisting such news no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as mr weston s confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife fewer and quieter but not less to the purpose,austen-emma
i shall soon bring him over to hartfield said he at the conclusion,austen-emma
think of me to morrow my dear emma about four o clock was mrs weston s parting injunction spoken with some anxiety and meant only for her,austen-emma
was a question however which did not augur much,austen-emma
tis twelve i shall not forget to think of you four hours hence and by this time to morrow perhaps or a little later i may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here,austen-emma
she felt immediately that she should like him and there was a well bred ease of manner and a readiness to talk which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her and that acquainted they soon must be,austen-emma
one cannot creep upon a journey one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned and the pleasure of coming in upon one s friends before the look out begins is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs,austen-emma
that he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before passed suspiciously through emma s brain but still if it were a falsehood it was a pleasant one and pleasantly handled,austen-emma
but when satisfied on all these points and their acquaintance proportionably advanced he contrived to find an opportunity while their two fathers were engaged with each other of introducing his mother in law and speaking of her with so much handsome praise so much warm admiration so much gratitude for the happiness she secured to his father and her very kind reception of himself as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her,austen-emma
and at last as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person,austen-emma
i hope i should know better he replied no depend upon it with a gallant bow that in addressing mrs weston i should understand whom i might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms,austen-emma
her own father s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion was a most comfortable circumstance,austen-emma
he had business at the crown about his hay and a great many errands for mrs weston at ford s but he need not hurry any body else,austen-emma
do you know any family of that name,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
you saw her with the campbells when she was the equal of every body she mixed with but here she is with a poor old grandmother who has barely enough to live on,austen-emma
if you were never particularly struck by her manners before said she i think you will to day,austen-emma
they will be extremely glad to see you i am sure and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way,austen-emma
emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance and could now engage to think of them all at randalls any hour of the day with full confidence in their comfort,austen-emma
highbury that airy cheerful happy looking highbury would be his constant attraction,austen-emma
if he were deficient there nothing should make amends for it,austen-emma
he was delighted with every thing admired hartfield sufficiently for mr woodhouse s ear and when their going farther was resolved on confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than emma could have supposed,austen-emma
he was immediately interested,austen-emma
they ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter,austen-emma
he seemed to have all the life and spirit cheerful feelings and social inclinations of his father and nothing of the pride or reserve of enscombe,austen-emma
yes oh,austen-emma
ten minutes would have been all that was necessary perhaps all that was proper and i had told my father i should certainly be at home before him but there was no getting away no pause and to my utter astonishment i found when he finding me nowhere else joined me there at last that i had been actually sitting with them very nearly three quarters of an hour,austen-emma
ladies can never look ill and seriously miss fairfax is naturally so pale as almost always to give the appearance of ill health a most deplorable want of complexion,austen-emma
well said emma there is no disputing about taste at least you admire her except her complexion,austen-emma
this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives as my father informs me,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
they went in and while the sleek well tied parcels of men s beavers and york tan were bringing down and displaying on the counter he said but i beg your pardon miss woodhouse you were speaking to me you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my,austen-emma
it is always the lady s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance,austen-emma
may i indeed then i will speak the truth and nothing suits me so well,austen-emma
you know miss fairfax s situation in life i conclude what she is destined to be,austen-emma
i certainly do forget to think of said emma as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend,austen-emma
repeated emma,austen-emma
she appeared to me to play well that is with considerable taste but i know nothing of the matter myself i am excessively fond of music but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body s performance i have been used to hear her s admired and i remember one proof of her being thought to play well a man a very musical man and in love with another woman engaged to her on the point of marriage would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument if the lady in question could sit down instead never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other,austen-emma
we shall know more about them all in half an hour from you than miss fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year,austen-emma
it was her very particular friend you know,austen-emma
you are right,austen-emma
as to that i do not,austen-emma
there appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all he began rather quickly but checking himself added however it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were how it might all be behind the scenes,austen-emma
i hardly know how it has happened a little perhaps from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was by her aunt and grandmother and all their set,austen-emma
one cannot love a reserved person,austen-emma
he perfectly agreed with her and after walking together so long and thinking so much alike emma felt herself so well acquainted with him that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting,austen-emma
if it were to be shared with the woman he loved he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house,austen-emma
but emma in her own mind determined that he know what he was talking about and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life and to marry from worthy motives,austen-emma
there was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve,austen-emma
mrs weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether,austen-emma
as mrs weston observed all young people would have their little whims,austen-emma
she had half a mind to resent but an instant s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings and not meant to provoke and therefore she let it pass,austen-emma
with their wealth their views increased their want of a larger house their inclination for more company,austen-emma
the coles were very respectable in their way but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them,austen-emma
harriet was to be there in the evening and the bateses,austen-emma
it was the arrival of this very invitation while the westons were at hartfield which made their presence so acceptable for though her first remark on reading it was that of course it must be declined she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful,austen-emma
as for going emma did not wish him to think it possible the hours would be too late and the party too numerous,austen-emma
i am sorry mr and mrs cole should have done it,austen-emma
miss taylor if you had not married you would have staid at home with me,austen-emma
with this treatment mr woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual,austen-emma
cole,austen-emma
we must remember to let james know that the carriage will be wanted on tuesday,austen-emma
you will get very tired when tea is over,austen-emma
you will not like the noise,austen-emma
emma s going away directly after tea might be giving offence,austen-emma
i know what worthy people they are,austen-emma
i am sure rather than run the risk of hurting mr and mrs cole you would stay a little longer than you might wish,austen-emma
i am only afraid of your sitting up for me,austen-emma
chapter viii,austen-emma
i do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way,austen-emma
there would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities no i am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly,austen-emma
she had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart for he stopped to hand her out,austen-emma
there is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them,austen-emma
i shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you,austen-emma
when the westons arrived the kindest looks of love the strongest of admiration were for her from both husband and wife the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object and at dinner she found him seated by her and as she firmly believed not without some dexterity on his side,austen-emma
she listened and found it well worth listening to,austen-emma
she knows their ways best but i should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present,austen-emma
this is like giving ourselves a slap to be sure,austen-emma
nay why do you,austen-emma
or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument which must now be shut up in london untouched by any body,austen-emma
i smile because you smile and shall probably suspect whatever i find you suspect but at present i do not see what there is to question,austen-emma
very true indeed,austen-emma
if so you must extend your suspicions and comprehend,austen-emma
we were speaking the other day you know of his being so warm an admirer of her performance,austen-emma
good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health and i dare say in her s,austen-emma
did you ever hear of that a water party and by some accident she was falling overboard,austen-emma
i dare say you would but i simple i saw nothing but the fact that miss fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that mr dixon caught her it was the work of a moment,austen-emma
the arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me,austen-emma
no i am sure it is not from the campbells,austen-emma
your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely,austen-emma
the conviction seemed real he looked as if he felt it,austen-emma
to be in company nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed to sit and smile and look pretty and say nothing was enough for the happiness of the present hour,austen-emma
they were soon joined by some of the gentlemen and the very first of the early was frank churchill,austen-emma
he had never seen so lovely a face and was delighted with her naivete,austen-emma
he told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining room hated sitting long was always the first to move when he could that his father mr knightley mr cox and mr cole were left very busy over parish business that as long as he had staid however it had been pleasant enough as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike sensible men and spoke so handsomely of highbury altogether thought it so abundant in agreeable families that emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much,austen-emma
one of those points on which his influence failed he then mentioned,austen-emma
i have made a most wretched discovery said he after a short pause i have been here a week to morrow half my time,austen-emma
no said he smiling that is no subject of regret at all,austen-emma
said she,austen-emma
i see nobody else looking like her i must go and ask her whether it is an irish fashion,austen-emma
my dear emma i am longing to talk to you,austen-emma
yes but how they were conveyed hither the manner of their coming,austen-emma
poor girl,austen-emma
nobody was ever so fortunate as herself,austen-emma
i do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them,austen-emma
well said mrs weston smiling you give him credit for more simple disinterested benevolence in this instance than i do for while miss bates was speaking a suspicion darted into my head and i have never been able to get it out again,austen-emma
exclaimed emma,austen-emma
i cannot at all consent to mr knightley s marrying and i am sure it is not at all likely,austen-emma
i could not bear to have henry supplanted mr knightley marry no i have never had such an idea and i cannot adopt it now,austen-emma
i see no probability in it unless you have any better foundation than what you mention,austen-emma
no no every feeling revolts,austen-emma
i am sure he has not the least idea of it,austen-emma
nonsense,austen-emma
if it would be good to her i am sure it would be evil to himself a very shameful and degrading connexion,austen-emma
do not mimic her,austen-emma
but the question is not whether it would be a bad connexion for him but whether he wishes it and i think he does,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
but i do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do,austen-emma
i have a very strong notion that it comes from him,austen-emma
frank churchill of whom in the eagerness of her conversation with mrs weston she had been seeing nothing except that he had found a seat by miss fairfax followed mr cole to add his very pressing entreaties and as in every respect it suited emma best to lead she gave a very proper compliance,austen-emma
they sang together once more and emma would then resign her place to miss fairfax whose performance both vocal and instrumental she never could attempt to conceal from herself was infinitely superior to her own,austen-emma
her objections to mr knightley s marrying did not in the least subside,austen-emma
knightley must never marry,austen-emma
as a sort of touchstone however she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own,austen-emma
this present from the campbells said she this pianoforte is very kindly given,austen-emma
from that moment emma could have taken her oath that mr knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument,austen-emma
one more they would not fatigue miss fairfax on any account and would only ask for one more,austen-emma
this must not be,austen-emma
here ceased the concert part of the evening for miss woodhouse and miss fairfax were the only young lady performers but soon within five minutes the proposal of dancing originating nobody exactly knew where was so effectually promoted by mr and mrs cole that every thing was rapidly clearing away to give proper space,austen-emma
if he were to be very alert in engaging jane fairfax now it might augur something,austen-emma
they were a couple worth looking at,austen-emma
i must have asked miss fairfax and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me after your s,austen-emma
perfect happiness even in memory is not common and there were two points on which she was not quite easy,austen-emma
she did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half,austen-emma
my playing is no more like her s than a lamp is like sunshine,austen-emma
every body last night said how well you played,austen-emma
ah,austen-emma
and i hate italian singing there is no understanding a word of it,austen-emma
they told me something said harriet rather hesitatingly but it is nothing of any consequence,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
he sat by her at dinner,austen-emma
harriet tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word was always very long at a purchase and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind emma went to the door for amusement much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of highbury mr perry walking hastily by mr william cox letting himself in at the office door mr cole s carriage horses returning from exercise or a stray letter boy on an obstinate mule were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone and a string of dawdling children round the baker s little bow window eyeing the gingerbread she knew she had no reason to complain and was amused enough quite enough still to stand at the door,austen-emma
mrs weston informed her that she was going to call on the bateses in order to hear the new instrument,austen-emma
mrs weston was disappointed,austen-emma
but perhaps i may be equally in the way here,austen-emma
i am here on no business of my own said emma i am only waiting for my friend,austen-emma
she might do very well by herself,austen-emma
it need not detain us long,austen-emma
and i always thought you meant it,austen-emma
asked mrs,austen-emma
but i shall want the ribbon directly so it had better go to hartfield at least the ribbon,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
to hartfield if you please mrs,austen-emma
my dear miss woodhouse said the latter i am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while and give us your opinion of our new instrument you and miss smith,austen-emma
how is mr,austen-emma
and by the bye every body ought to have two pair of spectacles they should indeed,austen-emma
here is the rivet of your mistress s spectacles out,austen-emma
but about the middle of the day she gets hungry and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples and they are extremely wholesome for i took the opportunity the other day of asking mr perry i happened to meet him in the street,austen-emma
well mrs weston you have prevailed i hope and these ladies will oblige us,austen-emma
i hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town,austen-emma
emma wondered on what of all the medley she would fix,austen-emma
said he i do think i can fasten the rivet i like a job of this kind excessively,austen-emma
indeed i must say that much as i had heard of him before and much as i had expected he very far exceeds any thing,austen-emma
he seems every thing the fondest parent could,austen-emma
said he i can fasten the rivet,austen-emma
that you know was so very,austen-emma
indeed they are very delightful apples and mrs wallis does them full justice only we do not have them baked more than twice and mr woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times but miss woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it,austen-emma
i am sure you must be said he and i will send you another supply for i have a great many more than i can ever use,austen-emma
oh said i my dear i did say as much as i could,austen-emma
william did not seem to mind it himself he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many for william you know thinks more of his master s profit than any thing but mrs hodges he said was quite displeased at their being all sent away,austen-emma
he would be so very,austen-emma
miss bates had just done as patty opened the door and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good will,austen-emma
miss smith the step at the turning,austen-emma
you find me trying to be useful tell me if you think i shall succeed,austen-emma
you see we have been wedging one leg with paper,austen-emma
at last jane began and though the first bars were feebly given the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to,austen-emma
do not you think so,austen-emma
do not distress her,austen-emma
do you imagine colonel campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him or that he may have sent only a general direction an order indefinite as to time to depend upon contingencies and conveniences,austen-emma
conjecture aye sometimes one conjectures right and sometimes one conjectures wrong,austen-emma
he was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter to escape a little from the latter he went to the pianoforte and begged miss fairfax who was still sitting at it to play something more,austen-emma
what felicity it is to hear a tune again which made one happy if i mistake not that was danced at weymouth,austen-emma
that from such a quarter one might expect,austen-emma
true affection only could have prompted it,austen-emma
i hope she does,austen-emma
i have now a key to all her odd looks and ways,austen-emma
she is playing at this moment favourite,austen-emma
quite delightful to have you all meet so our little room so honoured,austen-emma
pray come in do come in,austen-emma
how is she to day,austen-emma
so obliged to you so very much obliged to you for the carriage resumed miss bates,austen-emma
dear kingston are you mrs,austen-emma
but do come in,austen-emma
no not now i thank you,austen-emma
they will be so very happy to see you,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
we really are so shocked,austen-emma
he is off,austen-emma
,austen-emma
,austen-emma
yes my dear i dare say you might because you know the door was open and the window was open and mr knightley spoke loud,austen-emma
,austen-emma
chapter xi,austen-emma
but still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully mr frank churchill and miss woodhouse danced for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with jane fairfax and even for simple dancing itself without any of the wicked aids of vanity to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour in the hope of discovering in spite of all that mr weston could say of their exactly equal size that it was a little the largest,austen-emma
yes that will be quite enough for pleasure,austen-emma
and after all five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up,austen-emma
somebody else believed,austen-emma
it seemed the best scheme and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better,austen-emma
i could not bear it for emma emma is not strong,austen-emma
pray do not let them talk of it,austen-emma
i do not mean to set you against him but indeed he is not quite the thing,austen-emma
we allowed unnecessary room,austen-emma
but still he went on measuring and still he ended with,austen-emma
there is no denying it he replied,austen-emma
emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self willed and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her but she took the compliment and forgave the rest,austen-emma
i bring a new proposal on the subject a thought of my father s which waits only your approbation to be acted upon,austen-emma
it is his own idea,austen-emma
ten couple in either of the randalls rooms would have been insufferable dreadful i felt how right you were the whole time but was too anxious for securing to like to yield,austen-emma
she was obliged to repeat and explain it before it was fully comprehended and then being quite new farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable,austen-emma
no a very bad plan,austen-emma
mr perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill,austen-emma
nobody could be so imprudent,austen-emma
i have often known it done myself,austen-emma
one cannot resolve upon them in a hurry,austen-emma
there is no hurry at all,austen-emma
not that james ever complains but it is right to spare our horses when we can,austen-emma
mrs weston undertakes to direct the whole,austen-emma
aye very true,austen-emma
he came four times a day for a week,austen-emma
i was desired to say so from both,austen-emma
emma said she this paper is worse than i expected,austen-emma
you will see nothing of it by candlelight,austen-emma
it regarded a supper room,austen-emma
this made a difficulty,austen-emma
i do not think it so very small,austen-emma
i wish said mrs weston one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best,austen-emma
if one could ascertain what the chief of them the coles for instance,austen-emma
i think we do want a larger council,austen-emma
she will not even listen to your questions,austen-emma
here mr weston joined them and on hearing what was proposed gave it his decided approbation,austen-emma
she is a standing lesson of how to be happy,austen-emma
,austen-emma
i shall think you a great blockhead frank if you bring the aunt without the niece,austen-emma
and away he ran,austen-emma
and a delightful dance it was to be,austen-emma
that s right,austen-emma
the preparations must take their time nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on and for a few days they must be planning proceeding and hoping in uncertainty at the risk in her opinion the great risk of its being all in vain,austen-emma
to her voluntary communications emma could get no more approving reply than,austen-emma
this emma felt was aimed at her and it made her quite angry,austen-emma
what a disappointment it would be,austen-emma
alas,austen-emma
the substance of this letter was forwarded to emma in a note from mrs weston instantly,austen-emma
this wretched note was the finale of emma s breakfast,austen-emma
he thought principally of mrs churchill s illness and wanted to know how she was treated and as for the ball it was shocking to have dear emma disappointed but they would all be safer at home,austen-emma
of all horrid things leave taking is the worst,austen-emma
ah,austen-emma
if i can come again we are still to have our ball,austen-emma
he continued every day more precious and more delightful than the day before every day making me less fit to bear any other place,austen-emma
i am sure you did not much expect to like us,austen-emma
i am almost afraid that every moment will bring him,austen-emma
it was a right thing to do,austen-emma
he hesitated got up walked to a window,austen-emma
forcing herself to speak therefore in the hope of putting it by she calmly said,austen-emma
it was natural for him to feel that he had to sigh,austen-emma
he stopt again rose again and seemed quite embarrassed he was more in love with her than emma had supposed and who can say how it might have ended if his father had not made his appearance,austen-emma
i shall hear of every thing that is going on among you,austen-emma
in her letters i shall be at dear highbury again,austen-emma
certainly his being at randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks indescribable spirit the idea the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought the assurance of his attentions his liveliness his manners,austen-emma
this sensation of listlessness weariness stupidity this disinclination to sit down and employ myself this feeling of every thing s being dull and insipid about the house i must be in love i should be the oddest creature in the world if i were not for a few weeks at least,austen-emma
mr knightley however shewed no triumphant happiness,austen-emma
chapter xiii,austen-emma
but on the other hand she could not admit herself to be unhappy nor after the first morning to be less disposed for employment than usual she was still busy and cheerful and pleasing as he was she could yet imagine him to have faults and farther though thinking of him so much and as she sat drawing or working forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment fancying interesting dialogues and inventing elegant letters the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she,austen-emma
i do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness,austen-emma
upon the whole she was equally contented with her view of his feelings,austen-emma
this is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is but i do not know that i expect it will i do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man i do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy his feelings are warm but i can imagine them rather changeable every consideration of the subject in short makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved i shall do very well again after a little while and then it will be a good thing over for they say every body is in love once in their lives and i shall have been let off easily,austen-emma
compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words i had not a spare moment on tuesday as you know for miss woodhouse s beautiful little friend,austen-emma
gratifying however and stimulative as was the letter in the material part its sentiments she yet found when it was folded up and returned to mrs weston that it had not added any lasting warmth that she could still do without the writer and that he must learn to do without her,austen-emma
i must not dwell upon it said she i must not think of it,austen-emma
he would soon be among them again mr elton and his bride,austen-emma
poor harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that emma could give,austen-emma
you could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake i fell into,austen-emma
emma continued,austen-emma
i want you to save yourself from greater pain,austen-emma
miss woodhouse how ungrateful i have been,austen-emma
it is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved which gives isabella all her popularity i have it not but i know how to prize and respect it harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives,austen-emma
chapter xiv,austen-emma
compliments charades and horrible blunders and it was not to be supposed that poor harriet should not be recollecting too but she behaved very well and was only rather pale and silent,austen-emma
emma thought at least it would turn out so,austen-emma
there was a little hesitation in emma s answer,austen-emma
i am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love,austen-emma
miss hawkins perhaps wanted a home and thought this the best offer she was likely to have,austen-emma
no indeed miss woodhouse you need not be afraid i can sit and admire him now without any great misery,austen-emma
when the visit was returned emma made up her mind,austen-emma
the rich brother in law near bristol was the pride of the alliance and his place and his carriages were the pride of him,austen-emma
mr elton was appealed to was not it astonishingly like she could really almost fancy herself at maple grove,austen-emma
with a little sigh of sentiment,austen-emma
emma made as slight a reply as she could but it was fully sufficient for mrs elton who only wanted to be talking herself,austen-emma
people who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
many counties i believe are called the garden of england as well as surry,austen-emma
while they are with us we shall explore a great deal i dare say,austen-emma
we explored to king s weston twice last summer in that way most delightfully just after their first having the barouche landau,austen-emma
there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort,austen-emma
many a time has she said so and yet i am no advocate for entire seclusion,austen-emma
i assure you i have no doubt of its doing mr woodhouse good,austen-emma
and it is so cheerful a place that it could not fail of being of use to mr woodhouse s spirits which i understand are sometimes much depressed,austen-emma
it was as much as emma could bear without being impolite,austen-emma
upon these occasions a lady s character generally precedes her and highbury has long known that you are a superior performer,austen-emma
i am doatingly fond of music passionately fond and my friends say i am not entirely devoid of taste but as to any thing else upon my honour my performance is to the last degree,austen-emma
i honestly said as much to mr e when he was speaking of my future home and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable and the inferiority of the house too knowing what i had been accustomed to of course he was not wholly without apprehension,austen-emma
and as to smaller sized rooms than i had been used to i really could not give it a thought,austen-emma
we cannot suppose said emma smiling that mr elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a musical society in highbury and i hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of the motive,austen-emma
will not it be a good plan,austen-emma
i should hope not but really when i look around among my acquaintance i tremble,austen-emma
i believe i was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper,austen-emma
i like them extremely,austen-emma
having understood as much i was rather astonished to find her so very lady like,austen-emma
emma was quite at a loss,austen-emma
knightley is quite the gentleman,austen-emma
insufferable woman,austen-emma
knightley never seen him in her life before and call him knightley and discover that he is a gentleman,austen-emma
and to propose that she and i should unite to form a musical club,austen-emma
i never met with her equal,austen-emma
how angry and how diverted he would be,austen-emma
frank churchill comes as regularly into my mind,austen-emma
a little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear,austen-emma
but i ought to have gone before,austen-emma
i dare say your apologies were accepted sir,austen-emma
it ought to be no recommendation to,austen-emma
well papa if this is not encouragement to marry i do not know what is,austen-emma
her father was growing nervous and could not understand,austen-emma
such as mrs elton appeared to her on this second interview such she appeared whenever they met again self important presuming familiar ignorant and ill bred,austen-emma
in one respect mrs elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first,austen-emma
she was of course the object of their joint dislike when they had nothing else to say it must be always easy to begin abusing miss woodhouse and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of harriet,austen-emma
i do not scruple to say that she plays extremely well,austen-emma
we must bring her forward,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
one can see that she feels the want of encouragement,austen-emma
i assure you jane fairfax is a very delightful character and interests me more than i can express,austen-emma
have carriages to fetch and convey her home and live in a style which could not make the addition of jane fairfax at any time the least inconvenient i should be extremely displeased if wright were to send us up such a dinner as could make me regret having asked than jane fairfax to partake of it,austen-emma
my acquaintance is so very extensive that i have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly i shall introduce her of course very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us,austen-emma
elton jane fairfax and jane fairfax,austen-emma
she looked on with some amusement miss bates s gratitude for mrs elton s attentions to jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth,austen-emma
she is a riddle quite a riddle,austen-emma
would jane but go means were to be found servants sent friends contrived no travelling difficulty allowed to exist but still she had declined it,austen-emma
but why must she consent to be with the eltons here is quite a separate puzzle,austen-emma
you are right mrs weston said mr knightley warmly miss fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of mrs elton,austen-emma
such attentions as mrs elton s i should have imagined would rather disgust than gratify miss fairfax,austen-emma
another thing must be taken into consideration too mrs elton does not talk miss fairfax as she speaks her,austen-emma
such a woman as jane fairfax probably never fell in mrs elton s way before and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action if not in consciousness,austen-emma
the extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other,austen-emma
he stopped emma felt her foot pressed by mrs weston and did not herself know what to think,austen-emma
you are not vain mr knightley,austen-emma
you have scolded me too much for match making for me to presume to take such a liberty with you,austen-emma
you would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way if you were married,austen-emma
she has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife,austen-emma
cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours,austen-emma
and so i am not to be surprized that jane fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her,austen-emma
jane fairfax has feeling said mr knightley i do not accuse her of want of feeling,austen-emma
well mrs weston said emma triumphantly when he left them what do you say now to mr knightley s marrying jane fairfax,austen-emma
dinner parties and evening parties were made for him and his lady and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day,austen-emma
if this is living in the country it is nothing very formidable,austen-emma
mrs bates mrs perry mrs goddard and others were a good deal behind hand in knowledge of the world but she would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged,austen-emma
after emma had talked about it for ten minutes mr woodhouse felt no unwillingness and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him,austen-emma
if miss woodhouse would not be displeased she would rather stay at home,austen-emma
this is very true said she at least as far as relates to me which was all that was meant and it is very shameful of the same age and always knowing her i ought to have been more her friend she will never like me now,austen-emma
a circumstance rather unlucky occurred,austen-emma
the event was more favourable to mr woodhouse than to emma,austen-emma
instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner he was talking to miss fairfax,austen-emma
i hope you turned directly,austen-emma
a walk before breakfast does me good,austen-emma
the post office has a great charm at one period of our lives,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
business you know may bring money but friendship hardly ever does,austen-emma
you have every body dearest to you always at hand i probably never shall again and therefore till i have outlived all my affections a post office i think must always have power to draw me out in worse weather than to day,austen-emma
it was kindly said and very far from giving offence,austen-emma
they should take care of their health and their complexion,austen-emma
i wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour,austen-emma
my dear jane what is this i hear going to the post office in the rain this must not be i assure you you sad girl how could you do such a thing it is a sign i was not there to take care of you,austen-emma
mrs weston did you ever hear the like,austen-emma
better wait an hour or two or even half a day for your letters than run the risk of bringing on your cough again,austen-emma
she do such a thing again eagerly rejoined mrs elton,austen-emma
i am advised to be out of doors as much as i can i must walk somewhere and the post office is an object and upon my word i have scarcely ever had a bad morning before,austen-emma
if i meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore consider that point as settled,austen-emma
jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered but instead of answering she began speaking again to mr john knightley,austen-emma
so seldom that any negligence or blunder appears,austen-emma
that is the key to a great deal of capacity,austen-emma
isabella and emma i think do write very much alike,austen-emma
and so does poor mrs weston with half a sigh and half a smile at her,austen-emma
i do not admire it said mr knightley,austen-emma
no it by no means wanted strength it was not a large hand but very clear and certainly strong,austen-emma
he chose to say he was employed,austen-emma
dinner was on table mrs,austen-emma
she had heard and seen it all and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any,austen-emma
chapter xvii,austen-emma
here is april come,austen-emma
i have not even made any inquiry i do not wish to make any yet,austen-emma
but you have not seen so much of the world as i have,austen-emma
you may imagine how desirable,austen-emma
trouble,austen-emma
but my dear child the time is drawing near here is april and june or say even july is very near with such business to accomplish before us,austen-emma
there are places in town offices where inquiry would soon produce something offices for the sale not quite of human flesh but of human intellect,austen-emma
but i only mean to say that there are advertising offices and that by applying to them i should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do,austen-emma
a gentleman s family is all that i should condition for,austen-emma
for two or three months longer i shall remain where i am and as i am,austen-emma
but this good old mr woodhouse i wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner,austen-emma
i must put on a few ornaments now because it is expected of me,austen-emma
the whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing room when mr weston made his appearance among them,austen-emma
a man who had been in motion since eight o clock in the morning and might now have been still who had been long talking and might have been silent who had been in more than one crowd and might have been alone such a man to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside and on the evening of a cold sleety april day rush out again into the world could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife there would have been a motive but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party,austen-emma
the two ladies looked over it together and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time in a voice a little subdued but very audible to every body,austen-emma
they will stay a good while when they do come and he will be half his time with us,austen-emma
put it up put it up we will have a good talk about it some other time but it will not do now,austen-emma
her congratulations were warm and open but emma could not speak so fluently,austen-emma
chapter xviii,austen-emma
yes and i shall be very happy in his acquaintance,austen-emma
she is his principal correspondent i assure you,austen-emma
mr weston i could not have believed it of you,austen-emma
enscombe is in yorkshire,austen-emma
but what is distance mr weston to people of large fortune you would be amazed to hear how my brother mr suckling sometimes flies about,austen-emma
certainly delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions mrs elton,austen-emma
i give you notice you will find me a formidable antagonist on that point,austen-emma
depend upon it mrs churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did,austen-emma
selina is no fine lady i assure you,austen-emma
it was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was a fine lady perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it and she was considering in what way she had best retract when mr weston went on,austen-emma
if she is really ill why not go to bath mr,austen-emma
it is a retired place,austen-emma
you seem shut out from every thing in the most complete retirement and mrs churchill probably has not health or spirits like selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion,austen-emma
he will find an to the society of highbury when he comes again that is if i may presume to call myself an addition,austen-emma
not heard of you i believe mrs weston s letters lately have been full of very little else than mrs,austen-emma
that is always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon i was sure something favourable would turn up but nobody believed me,austen-emma
i have observed mrs elton in the course of my life that if things are going untowardly one month they are sure to mend the next,austen-emma
the carriage we had disappointments about the carriage one morning i remember he came to me quite in despair,austen-emma
now will be the time,austen-emma
he is generally thought a fine young man but do not expect a prodigy,austen-emma
i give you notice that as i find your son so i shall judge of him i am no flatterer,austen-emma
she was the instigator,austen-emma
only think,austen-emma
people of the name of tupman very lately settled there and encumbered with many low connexions but giving themselves immense airs and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families,austen-emma
it is infinitely too bad,austen-emma
the remaining five were left to their own powers and emma doubted their getting on very well for mr knightley seemed little disposed for conversation mrs elton was wanting notice which nobody had inclination to pay and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent,austen-emma
i rather hope to satisfy you both said emma for i shall do all in my power to make them happy which will be enough for isabella and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic,austen-emma
increase,austen-emma
witness this very time,austen-emma
yes said his brother quickly it is randalls that does it all,austen-emma
i shall certainly be at leisure,austen-emma
i can understand you nodding at mr john knightley your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here delights you too much to pass unnoticed,austen-emma
chapter i,austen-emma
she did not mean to have her own affections entangled again and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his,austen-emma
it was not very long though rather longer than mr weston had foreseen before she had the power of forming some opinion of frank churchill s feelings,austen-emma
but she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree,austen-emma
it was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference,austen-emma
this was the only visit from frank churchill in the course of ten days,austen-emma
that she was really ill was very certain he had declared himself convinced of it at randalls,austen-emma
her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering and by the ten days end her nephew s letter to randalls communicated a change of plan,austen-emma
she was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them almost as often as he could even wish,austen-emma
mr weston s own happiness was indisputable,austen-emma
he would be always coming over,austen-emma
better than nearer,austen-emma
a very few to morrows stood between the young people of highbury and happiness,austen-emma
chapter ii,austen-emma
mr weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came that she could not refuse him and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man s company,austen-emma
she was going to exclaim but she presently found that it was a family of old friends who were coming like herself by particular desire to help mr weston s judgment and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness on the same errand that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection,austen-emma
they had stopped at mrs bates s door to offer the use of their carriage but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the eltons,austen-emma
i have a great curiosity to see mrs elton i have heard so much of her,austen-emma
i have never seen either mr or mrs elton,austen-emma
we thought you were to bring them,austen-emma
in a few minutes the carriage returned somebody talked of rain i will see that there are umbrellas sir said frank to his father miss bates must not be forgotten and away he went,austen-emma
i think him a very handsome young man and his manners are precisely what i like and approve so truly the gentleman without the least conceit or puppyism,austen-emma
while she talked of his son mr weston s attention was chained but when she got to maple grove he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to and with happy smiles must hurry away,austen-emma
miss bates and miss fairfax escorted by the two gentlemen walked into the room and mrs elton seemed to think it as much her duty as mrs weston s to receive them,austen-emma
i do not care for myself,austen-emma
could not have imagined it so well lighted up jane jane look did you ever see any thing,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
very happy to hear it,austen-emma
jane and i quite ready,austen-emma
i said to my mother upon my word ma am,austen-emma
there were three others jane says which they hesitated about some time,austen-emma
does not she jane do not we often talk of mr frank churchill ah,austen-emma
must go and speak to dr and mrs hughes for a moment how do you do,austen-emma
don t disturb him,austen-emma
how do you all do quite well i am much obliged to you,austen-emma
every thing so good,austen-emma
mrs elton then said nobody can think less of dress in general than i do but upon such an occasion as this when every body s eyes are so much upon me and in compliment to the westons who i have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour i would not wish to be inferior to others,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
elton,austen-emma
then changing from a frown to a smile no do not tell me i do not want to know what you mean where is my father when are we to begin dancing,austen-emma
and what are we to do for a proper partner for her,austen-emma
it was almost enough to make her think of marrying,austen-emma
she must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing but if he were criticising her behaviour she did not feel afraid,austen-emma
the anxious cares the incessant attentions of mrs weston were not thrown away,austen-emma
escape however was not his plan,austen-emma
elton,austen-emma
if mrs gilbert wishes to dance said he i shall have great pleasure i am sure for though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man and that my dancing days are over it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like mrs,austen-emma
any thing else i should be most happy to do at your command but my dancing days are over,austen-emma
she would not look again,austen-emma
it was not thrown away on her she bounded higher than ever flew farther down the middle and was in a continual course of smiles,austen-emma
the move began and miss bates might be heard from that moment without interruption till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon,austen-emma
you are too obliging,austen-emma
said i i shall not forestall jane i left her dancing with mr george otway she will love to tell you all about it herself to morrow her first partner was mr elton i do not know who will ask her next perhaps mr william cox,austen-emma
two steps jane take care of the two steps,austen-emma
i was convinced there were two and there is but one,austen-emma
where shall we sit,austen-emma
what you direct in this house cannot be wrong,austen-emma
emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr knightley till after supper but when they were all in the ballroom again her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked,austen-emma
i did replied emma and they cannot forgive me,austen-emma
not your vain spirit but your serious spirit if one leads you wrong i am sure the other tells you of it,austen-emma
an unpretending single minded artless girl infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as mrs elton,austen-emma
every body is asleep,austen-emma
will you,austen-emma
no indeed,austen-emma
it seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened and she were enabled to see that mr elton was not the superior creature she had believed him,austen-emma
she did not regret it,austen-emma
a few minutes made emma acquainted with the whole,austen-emma
how the trampers might have behaved had the young ladies been more courageous must be doubtful but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted and harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children headed by a stout woman and a great boy all clamorous and impertinent in look though not absolutely in word more and more frightened she immediately promised them money and taking out her purse gave them a shilling and begged them not to want more or to use her ill she was then able to walk though but slowly and was moving away but her terror and her purse were too tempting and she was followed or rather surrounded by the whole gang demanding more,austen-emma
he had left them completely frightened and harriet eagerly clinging to him and hardly able to speak had just strength enough to reach hartfield before her spirits were quite overcome,austen-emma
could a linguist could a grammarian could even a mathematician have seen what she did have witnessed their appearance together and heard their history of it without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other how much more must an imaginist like herself be on fire with speculation and foresight especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made,austen-emma
it was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other,austen-emma
there could be no harm in a scheme a mere passive scheme,austen-emma
it was the very event to engage those who talk most the young and the low and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news,austen-emma
the gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice they took themselves off in a hurry,austen-emma
emma was a good deal surprized but begged her to speak,austen-emma
yes said emma i hope i do,austen-emma
cried harriet warmly,austen-emma
not the least in the world did he ever give you any thing,austen-emma
within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little tunbridge ware box which harriet opened it was well lined with the softest cotton but excepting the cotton emma saw only a small piece of court plaister,austen-emma
and so then in my nonsense i could not help making a treasure of it so i put it by never to be used and looked at it now and then as a great treat,austen-emma
my sins my sins and i had plenty all the while in my pocket one of my senseless tricks i deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life well sitting down again go on what else,austen-emma
and secretly she added to herself lord bless me,austen-emma
it was the end of an old pencil the part without any lead,austen-emma
i do remember it cried emma i perfectly remember it talking about spruce beer oh,austen-emma
i do not know,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
yes simpleton as i was but i am quite ashamed of it now and wish i could forget as easily as i can burn them,austen-emma
it has a disagreeable look to me,austen-emma
churchill,austen-emma
never marry this is a new resolution,austen-emma
cried harriet indignantly oh,austen-emma
plain dealing was always best,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
it is very natural,austen-emma
perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can at any rate do not let them carry you far unless you are persuaded of his liking you,austen-emma
henceforward i know nothing of the matter,austen-emma
harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude,austen-emma
to highbury in general it brought no material change,austen-emma
every thing declared it his own attentions his father s hints his mother in law s guarded silence it was all in unison words conduct discretion and indiscretion told the same story,austen-emma
when he was again in their company he could not help remembering what he had seen nor could he avoid observations which unless it were like cowper and his fire at twilight,austen-emma
they all united and on reaching hartfield gates emma who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him,austen-emma
mrs weston looked surprized and said i did not know that he ever had any such plan,austen-emma
indeed you did,austen-emma
you must remember it now,austen-emma
you will not be sorry to find yourself at home,austen-emma
you had it from himself had you,austen-emma
it is odd though observed his father that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at enscombe,austen-emma
well frank your dream certainly shews that highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent,austen-emma
mrs perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed,austen-emma
i am a talker you know i am rather a talker and now and then i have let a thing escape me which i should not,austen-emma
perfectly remember mrs perry s coming extraordinary dream indeed,austen-emma
the two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass,austen-emma
miss woodhouse said frank churchill after examining a table behind him which he could reach as he sat have your nephews taken away their alphabets their box of letters,austen-emma
i want to puzzle you again,austen-emma
she gave a slight glance round the table and applied herself to it,austen-emma
the word was and as harriet exultingly proclaimed it there was a blush on jane s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible,austen-emma
these letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick,austen-emma
for shame,austen-emma
this gallant young man who seemed to love without feeling and to recommend himself without complaisance directly handed over the word to miss fairfax and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it,austen-emma
aye very true my dear cried the latter though jane had not spoken a word i was just going to say the same thing,austen-emma
jane s alertness in moving proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived,austen-emma
it was his duty,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
she would rather busy herself about any thing than speak,austen-emma
yet he would speak,austen-emma
yes perfectly why do you make a doubt of it,austen-emma
i have lately imagined that i saw symptoms of attachment between them certain expressive looks which i did not believe meant to be public,austen-emma
that is i it to be so on her side and i can for its being so on his,austen-emma
that he might not be irritated into an absolute fever by the fire which mr woodhouse s tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year he soon afterwards took a hasty leave and walked home to the coolness and solitude of donwell abbey,austen-emma
mrs elton was very much disappointed,austen-emma
they could go there again with them in the autumn,austen-emma
this was so very well understood between them that emma could not but feel some surprise and a little displeasure on hearing from mr weston that he had been proposing to mrs elton as her brother and sister had failed her that the two parties should unite and go together and that as mrs elton had very readily acceded to it so it was to be if she had no objection,austen-emma
such schemes as these are nothing without numbers,austen-emma
emma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private,austen-emma
she cried and such weather for exploring these delays and disappointments are quite odious,austen-emma
come and eat my strawberries,austen-emma
she promised him again and again to come much oftener than he doubted and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it,austen-emma
i cannot name a day said he till i have spoken to some others whom i would wish to meet you,austen-emma
i will bring friends with me,austen-emma
i am no young lady on her preferment,austen-emma
no he calmly replied there is but one married woman in the world whom i can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to donwell and that one is,austen-emma
she cried satisfied to have no one preferred to herself you are a humourist and may say what you like,austen-emma
i know you are attached to them,austen-emma
here probably this basket with pink ribbon,austen-emma
every thing as natural and simple as possible,austen-emma
when you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden there shall be cold meat in the house,austen-emma
well but if any difficulties should arise my housekeeper is extremely clever,austen-emma
in a country life i conceive it to be a sort of necessary for let a woman have ever so many resources it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home and very long walks you know in summer there is dust and in winter there is dirt,austen-emma
i would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible,austen-emma
you have hit upon the very thing to please me,austen-emma
he did consent,austen-emma
he thought it very well done of mr knightley to invite them very kind and sensible much cleverer than dining out he was not fond of dining out,austen-emma
it was so long since emma had been at the abbey that as soon as she was satisfied of her father s comfort she was glad to leave him and look around her eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family,austen-emma
seats tolerably in the shade were found and now emma was obliged to overhear what mrs elton and jane fairfax were talking of a situation a most desirable situation was in question,austen-emma
the pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear,austen-emma
in this walk emma and mr weston found all the others assembled and towards this view she immediately perceived mr knightley and harriet distinct from the rest quietly leading the way,austen-emma
he was giving harriet information as to modes of agriculture etc,austen-emma
the next remove was to the house they must all go in and eat and they were all seated and busy and still frank churchill did not come,austen-emma
churchill s state however as many were ready to remind her was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her nephew in the most reasonable dependence and mrs weston was at last persuaded to believe or to say that it must be by some attack of mrs churchill that he was prevented coming emma looked at harriet while the point was under consideration she behaved very well and betrayed no emotion,austen-emma
mr woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused,austen-emma
till they all come in i shall not be missed and when they do will you have the goodness to say that i am gone,austen-emma
let my father s servant go with you let me order the carriage,austen-emma
the heat even would be danger you are fatigued already,austen-emma
she saw it all and entering into her feelings promoted her quitting the house immediately and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend,austen-emma
such an aunt,austen-emma
emma had not been thinking of him she had forgotten to think of him but she was very glad to see him,austen-emma
you will soon be cooler if you sit still said emma,austen-emma
emma listened and looked and soon perceived that frank churchill s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour,austen-emma
in two minutes however he relented in his own favour and muttering something about spruce beer walked off,austen-emma
he was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal and came back all the better grown quite cool and with good manners like himself able to draw a chair close to them take an interest in their employment and regret in a reasonable way that he should be so late,austen-emma
you will have my sketches some time or other to look at or my tour to read or my poem,austen-emma
they may be induced to go too,austen-emma
i ought to travel,austen-emma
cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself and be contented to stay,austen-emma
i do not consider myself at all a fortunate person,austen-emma
i shall sit by you,austen-emma
no certainly not i shall go home in the cool of the evening,austen-emma
but if i do i shall be crosser still,austen-emma
the rest of the party were now returning and all were soon collected,austen-emma
she smiled her acceptance and nothing less than a summons from richmond was to take him back before the following evening,austen-emma
mrs weston remained with mr woodhouse,austen-emma
the eltons walked together mr knightley took charge of miss bates and jane and emma and harriet belonged to frank churchill,austen-emma
she had never seen frank churchill so silent and stupid,austen-emma
to amuse her and be agreeable in her eyes seemed all that he cared for and emma glad to be enlivened not sorry to be flattered was gay and easy too and gave him all the friendly encouragement the admission to be gallant which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance but which now in her own estimation meant nothing though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no english word but flirtation could very well describe,austen-emma
she still intended him for her friend,austen-emma
but you were humble,austen-emma
it is hotter to day,austen-emma
perhaps i intended you to say so but i meant self command,austen-emma
and you can be always with me,austen-emma
that is your date,austen-emma
i saw you first in february,austen-emma
what shall we do to rouse them,austen-emma
miss bates said a great deal mrs elton swelled at the idea of miss woodhouse s presiding mr knightley s answer was the most distinct,austen-emma
let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of,austen-emma
her mutterings were chiefly to her husband and he murmured in reply,austen-emma
it will not do whispered frank to emma they are most of them affronted,austen-emma
very well exclaimed miss bates then i need not be uneasy,austen-emma
emma could not resist,austen-emma
ah well to be sure,austen-emma
i will do my best,austen-emma
a conundrum of mr weston s shall clear him and his next neighbour,austen-emma
i am sure i do not know,austen-emma
understanding and gratification came together,austen-emma
for myself i protest i must be excused said mrs elton really cannot attempt i am not at all fond of the sort of thing,austen-emma
miss woodhouse must excuse me,austen-emma
pass mr e knightley jane and myself,austen-emma
with all my heart,austen-emma
said frank churchill as soon as they were out of hearing how well they suit one another very lucky marrying as they did upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place they only knew each other i think a few weeks in bath,austen-emma
miss fairfax who had seldom spoken before except among her own confederates spoke now,austen-emma
she recovered her voice,austen-emma
well i have so little confidence in my own judgment that whenever i marry i hope some body will chuse my wife for me,austen-emma
find some body for me,austen-emma
very well,austen-emma
i shall go abroad for a couple of years and when i return i shall come to you for my wife,austen-emma
hazle eyes excepted two years more might make her all that he wished,austen-emma
if you please my dear,austen-emma
there she is no that s somebody else,austen-emma
the appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart and the solicitude of mrs elton to have carriage first were gladly endured in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure,austen-emma
i cannot see you acting wrong without a remonstrance,austen-emma
it was not so very bad,austen-emma
i wish you could have heard how she talked of it with what candour and generosity,austen-emma
were she a woman of fortune i would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance i would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner,austen-emma
you whom she had known from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble her and before her niece too and before others many of whom certainly would be entirely guided by treatment of her this is not pleasant to you emma and it is very far from pleasant to me but i must i will i will tell you truths while i can satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now,austen-emma
he had turned away and the horses were in motion,austen-emma
the truth of this representation there was no denying,austen-emma
time did not compose her,austen-emma
chapter viii,austen-emma
indeed lay real pleasure for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty four to his comfort and feeling that unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem she could not in her general conduct be open to any severe reproach,austen-emma
she had been often remiss her conscience told her so remiss perhaps more in thought than fact scornful ungracious,austen-emma
she had no objection,austen-emma
there was a bustle on her approach a good deal of moving and talking,austen-emma
i am afraid jane is not very well said she but i do not know they me she is well,austen-emma
do you sit where you like,austen-emma
a very friendly inquiry after miss fairfax she hoped might lead the way to a return of old feelings,austen-emma
my dear said i you will blind yourself for tears were in her eyes perpetually,austen-emma
she is as low as possible,austen-emma
she will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you miss woodhouse but your kindness will excuse her,austen-emma
but then patty came in and said it was you,austen-emma
emma was most sincerely interested,austen-emma
so very kind,austen-emma
to a mrs smallridge charming woman most superior to have the charge of her three little girls delightful children,austen-emma
the most indefatigable true friend,austen-emma
i had not the least idea jane took mrs elton aside and told her at once that upon thinking over the advantages of mrs smallridge s situation she had come to the resolution of accepting it i did not know a word of it till it was all settled,austen-emma
you spend your evening with us said she i positively must have you come,austen-emma
however shall always think it a very pleasant party and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it,austen-emma
yes indeed there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it,austen-emma
ah,austen-emma
within a fortnight,austen-emma
yes jane says she is sure they will but yet this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining,austen-emma
poor old john i have a great regard for him he was clerk to my poor father twenty seven years and now poor old man he is bed ridden and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints i must go and see him to day and so will jane i am sure if she gets out at all,austen-emma
miss bates would hardly give emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of mr frank churchill s going she proceeded to give them all it was of no consequence,austen-emma
what is to become of that very true,austen-emma
and to this day i do believe she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter s,austen-emma
knightley immediately got up and in a manner decidedly graver than usual said,austen-emma
but is not this a sudden scheme,austen-emma
well my dear and did you get there safely and how did you find my worthy old friend and her daughter i dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming,austen-emma
she was warmly gratified and in another moment still more so by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part he took her hand whether she had not herself made the first motion she could not say she might perhaps have rather offered it but he took her hand pressed it and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips when from some fancy or other he suddenly let it go why he should feel such a scruple why he should change his mind when it was all but done she could not perceive he would have judged better she thought if he had not stopped the intention however was indubitable and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry or however else it happened but she thought nothing became him more it was with him of so simple yet so dignified a nature she could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction,austen-emma
it was a pity that she had not come back earlier,austen-emma
i hope it is a dry situation and that her health will be taken good care of,austen-emma
an express arrived at randalls to announce the death of mrs churchill,austen-emma
every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow tenderness towards the departed solicitude for the surviving friends and in a reasonable time curiosity to know where she would be buried,austen-emma
the event acquitted her of all the fancifulness and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints,austen-emma
mr churchill would never get over it,austen-emma
it was also a very early speculation with emma,austen-emma
all that remained to be wished was that the nephew should form the attachment as with all her goodwill in the cause emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed,austen-emma
short letters from frank were received at randalls communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans,austen-emma
she wanted to be of use to her wanted to shew a value for her society and testify respect and consideration,austen-emma
her health seemed for the moment completely deranged appetite quite gone and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms nothing touching the pulmonary complaint which was the standing apprehension of the family mr perry was uneasy about her,austen-emma
he very much feared that miss fairfax derived more evil than good from them,austen-emma
emma felt that her own note had deserved something better but it was impossible to quarrel with words whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted,austen-emma
on that subject poor miss bates was very unhappy and very communicative jane would hardly eat any thing mr perry recommended nourishing food but every thing they could command and never had any body such good neighbours was distasteful,austen-emma
her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits inconsistency of action and inequality of powers and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling or esteemed so little worthy as a friend but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good and of being able to say to herself that could mr knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting jane fairfax could he even have seen into her heart he would not on this occasion have found any thing to reprove,austen-emma
mrs weston wants to see you,austen-emma
certainly,austen-emma
you will know it all in time,austen-emma
now said emma when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates now mr weston do let me know what has happened,austen-emma
break it to me cried emma standing still with terror good god mr,austen-emma
,austen-emma
your word why not your honour why not say upon your honour that it has nothing to do with any of them,austen-emma
i was wrong he continued in talking of its being to you,austen-emma
she asked no more questions therefore merely employed her own fancy and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern something just come to light of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family something which the late event at richmond had brought forward,austen-emma
said she as they proceeded speaking more to assist mr weston in keeping his secret than with any other view,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
i shall leave you together,austen-emma
mrs weston was looking so ill and had an air of so much perturbation that emma s uneasiness increased and the moment they were alone she eagerly said,austen-emma
do not let mine continue longer,austen-emma
so far as that it relates to mr frank churchill i do guess,austen-emma
he came to speak to his father on a subject to announce an attachment,austen-emma
jane fairfax good god,austen-emma
there has been a solemn engagement between them ever since october formed at weymouth and kept a secret from every body,austen-emma
what engaged to her all the winter before either of them came to highbury,austen-emma
mrs weston looked up afraid to believe but emma s countenance was as steady as her words,austen-emma
this is the simple truth,austen-emma
i have escaped and that i should escape may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself,austen-emma
and how could bear such behaviour,austen-emma
he was here only a quarter of an hour and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said,austen-emma
much much beyond impropriety it has sunk him i cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion,austen-emma
smallridge too,austen-emma
on this article i can fully acquit him,austen-emma
he told me at parting that he should soon write and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now,austen-emma
let us have patience,austen-emma
most favourably for his nephew gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty,austen-emma
thought emma he would have done as much for harriet,austen-emma
none not one,austen-emma
i am quite easy on that head replied mrs weston,austen-emma
at this moment mr weston appeared at a little distance from the window evidently on the watch,austen-emma
and how much may be said in her situation for even that error,austen-emma
a very pretty trick you have been playing me upon my word,austen-emma
a glance or two between him and his wife convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate,austen-emma
those were the words in them lay the tormenting ideas which emma could not get rid of and which constituted the real misery of the business to her,austen-emma
she was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice it was true that she had not to charge herself in this instance as in the former with being the sole and original author of the mischief with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered harriet s imagination for harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of frank churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed,austen-emma
she was extremely angry with herself,austen-emma
an airing in the hartfield carriage would have been the rack and arrowroot from the hartfield storeroom must have been poison,austen-emma
considering the very superior claims of the object it ought and judging by its apparently stronger effect on harriet s mind producing reserve and self command it would she must communicate the painful truth however and as soon as possible,austen-emma
it was her superior duty,austen-emma
well miss woodhouse,austen-emma
did you ever hear any thing so strange,austen-emma
said emma still perplexed,austen-emma
her character appeared absolutely changed,austen-emma
can you seriously ask me harriet whether i imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that i was tacitly if not openly encouraging you to give way to your own feelings i never had the slightest suspicion till within the last hour of mr frank churchill s having the least regard for jane fairfax,austen-emma
i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject replied emma smiling but you do not mean to deny that there was a time and not very distant either when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him,austen-emma
cried emma after a moment s pause what do you mean good heaven,austen-emma
i know we agreed never to name him but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person,austen-emma
at first if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened that there had been matches of greater disparity those were your very words i should not have dared to give way to i should not have thought it possible but if who had been always acquainted with him,austen-emma
to be sure i am,austen-emma
i am sure the service mr frank churchill had rendered you in protecting you from the gipsies was spoken of,austen-emma
oh dear cried harriet now i recollect what you mean but i was thinking of something very different at the time,austen-emma
good god,austen-emma
emma could not speak,austen-emma
but you are too good for that i am sure,austen-emma
emma s eyes were instantly withdrawn and she sat silently meditating in a fixed attitude for a few minutes,austen-emma
why was the evil so dreadfully increased by harriet s having some hope of a return,austen-emma
how inconsiderate how indelicate how irrational how unfeeling had been her conduct,austen-emma
her voice was not unsteady but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self such a burst of threatening evil such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions must create she listened with much inward suffering but with great outward patience to harriet s detail methodical or well arranged or very well delivered it could not be expected to be but it contained when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration a substance to sink her spirit especially with the corroborating circumstances which her own memory brought in favour of mr knightley s most improved opinion of harriet,austen-emma
she had often observed the change to almost the same extent harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of harriet,austen-emma
on the subject of the first of the two circumstances she did after a little reflection venture the following question,austen-emma
i hope i know better now than to care for mr martin or to be suspected of it,austen-emma
the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech the many bitter feelings made the utmost exertion necessary on emma s side to enable her to say on reply,austen-emma
she could not compose herself mr woodhouse would be alarmed she had better go with most ready encouragement from her friend therefore she passed off through another door and the moment she was gone this was the spontaneous burst of emma s feelings oh god,austen-emma
to understand thoroughly understand her own heart was the first endeavour,austen-emma
she saw that in persuading herself in fancying in acting to the contrary she had been entirely under a delusion totally ignorant of her own heart and in short that she had never really cared for frank churchill at all,austen-emma
she was proved to have been universally mistaken and she had not quite done nothing for she had done mischief,austen-emma
such a debasement on his,austen-emma
had she never brought harriet forward,austen-emma
was not that her own doing too,austen-emma
she had not deserved it she had often been negligent or perverse slighting his advice or even wilfully opposing him insensible of half his merits and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own but still from family attachment and habit and thorough excellence of mind he had loved her and watched over her from a girl with an endeavour to improve her and an anxiety for her doing right which no other creature had at all shared,austen-emma
she had received a very recent proof of its impartiality how shocked had he been by her behaviour to miss bates,austen-emma
she would not marry even if she were asked by mr knightley,austen-emma
this point was just arranged when a visitor arrived to tear emma s thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them sleeping or waking the last twenty four hours mrs weston who had been calling on her daughter in law elect and took hartfield in her way home almost as much in duty to emma as in pleasure to herself to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview,austen-emma
they had gone in short and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady,austen-emma
apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and mr weston must necessarily open the cause but when these effusions were put by they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement,austen-emma
poor girl,austen-emma
the consequence said she has been a state of perpetual suffering to me and so it ought,austen-emma
do not imagine madam she continued that i was taught wrong,austen-emma
she loves him then excessively i suppose,austen-emma
on your side my love it was very innocently done,austen-emma
she then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected desired me whenever i had an opportunity to thank you i could not thank you too much for every wish and every endeavour to do her good,austen-emma
they shew her to the greatest advantage,austen-emma
she talked with a great deal of reason and at least equal affection but she had too much to urge for emma s attention it was soon gone to brunswick square or to donwell she forgot to attempt to listen and when mrs weston ended with we have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but i hope it will soon come she was obliged to pause before she answered and at last obliged to answer at random before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for,austen-emma
i am always well you know,austen-emma
of all the sources of evil surrounding the former since her coming to highbury she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst,austen-emma
a cold stormy rain set in and nothing of july appeared but in the trees and shrubs which the wind was despoiling and the length of the day which only made such cruel sights the longer visible,austen-emma
the picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter had proved erroneous no friends had deserted them no pleasures had been lost but her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction,austen-emma
they would be married and settled either at or near enscombe,austen-emma
chapter xiii,austen-emma
she had been thinking of him the moment before as unquestionably sixteen miles distant there was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind,austen-emma
he must have had a wet ride yes he meant to walk with her she found,austen-emma
she thought he was often looking at her and trying for a fuller view of her face than it suited her to give,austen-emma
with him it was most unnatural,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
cried emma turning her glowing cheeks towards him for while she spoke it occurred to her that he might have called at mrs goddard s in his way,austen-emma
time my dearest emma time will heal the wound your own excellent sense your exertions for your father s sake i know you will not allow yourself,austen-emma
she deserves a better fate,austen-emma
cried he looking eagerly at her are you indeed,austen-emma
he listened in perfect silence,austen-emma
many circumstances assisted the temptation,austen-emma
and now i can tolerably comprehend his behaviour,austen-emma
i have never had a high opinion of frank churchill i can suppose however that i may have underrated him,austen-emma
so early in life at three and twenty a period when if a man chuses a wife he generally chuses ill at three and twenty to have drawn such a prize,austen-emma
in one respect he is the object of my envy,austen-emma
emma i must tell you what you will not ask though i may wish it unsaid the next moment,austen-emma
emma could not bear to give him pain,austen-emma
no replied emma quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke i should like to take another turn,austen-emma
repeated mr,austen-emma
she could really say nothing you are silent he cried with great animation absolutely silent,austen-emma
but you know what i am you hear nothing but truth from me i have blamed you and lectured you and you have borne it as no other woman in england would have borne it bear with the truths i would tell you now dearest emma as well as you have borne with them,austen-emma
she felt for harriet with pain and with contrition but no flight of generosity run mad opposing all that could be probable or reasonable entered her brain,austen-emma
seldom very seldom does complete truth belong to any human disclosure seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised or a little mistaken but where as in this case though the conduct is mistaken the feelings are not it may not be very material mr knightley could not impute to emma a more relenting heart than she possessed or a heart more disposed to accept of his,austen-emma
change was equal this one half hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance jealousy or distrust on his side there had been a long standing jealousy old as the arrival or even the expectation of frank churchill he had been in love with emma and jealous of frank churchill from about the same period one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other,austen-emma
he had found her agitated and low frank churchill was a villain he heard her declare that she had never loved him,austen-emma
poor mr woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride could he have seen the heart he would have cared very little for the lungs but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from mr perry and talked on with much self contentment totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return,austen-emma
she hardly knew yet what mr knightley would ask but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father she even wept over the idea of it as a sin of thought,austen-emma
i have the greatest pleasure my dear emma in forwarding to you the enclosed,austen-emma
my dear madam,austen-emma
this was the fact,austen-emma
every possibility of good was before me and the first of blessings secured in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence,austen-emma
with the greatest respect and the warmest friendship do i mention miss woodhouse my father perhaps will think i ought to add with the deepest humiliation a few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion and some censure i acknowledge myself liable to my behaviour to miss woodhouse indicated i believe more than it ought in order to assist a concealment so essential to me i was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown i cannot deny that miss woodhouse was my ostensible object but i am sure you will believe the declaration that had i not been convinced of her indifference i would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on amiable and delightful as miss woodhouse is she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me was as much my conviction as my wish she received my attentions with an easy friendly goodhumoured playfulness which exactly suited me,austen-emma
she frequently gave me hints of it,austen-emma
if you remember any queernesses set them all to the right account of the pianoforte so much talked of i feel it only necessary to say that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to miss f who would never have allowed me to send it had any choice been given her the delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement my dear madam is much beyond my power of doing justice to,austen-emma
perhaps it is paid already,austen-emma
my uncle has been too good for me to encroach i must still add to this long letter,austen-emma
i behaved shamefully,austen-emma
i was late i met her walking home by herself and wanted to walk with her but she would not suffer it,austen-emma
even then i was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time but i was the injured person injured by her coldness and i went away determined that she should make the first advances i shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the box hill party,austen-emma
have patience with me i shall soon have done she closed with this offer resolving to break with me entirely and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again this letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt s death,austen-emma
without his sanction i could not hope to be listened to again i spoke circumstances were in my favour the late event had softened away his pride and he was earlier than i could have anticipated wholly reconciled and complying and could say at last poor man,austen-emma
now my dear madam i will release you but i could not conclude before,austen-emma
she was obliged in spite of her previous determination to the contrary to do it all the justice that mrs weston foretold,austen-emma
i shall be very glad to look it over said he but it seems long,austen-emma
he began stopping however almost directly to say had i been offered the sight of one of this gentleman s letters to his mother in law a few months ago emma it would not have been taken with such indifference,austen-emma
it will be natural for me he added shortly afterwards to speak my opinion aloud as i read,austen-emma
mr knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity,austen-emma
you pass it over very handsomely but you were perfectly right,austen-emma
natural enough his own mind full of intrigue that he should suspect it in others mystery finesse how they pervert the understanding,austen-emma
ah,austen-emma
i perfectly agree with you sir was then his remark,austen-emma
we must look to her one fault and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment,austen-emma
there is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends the eltons was his next observation his feelings are natural what,austen-emma
what does this mean,austen-emma
i shall soon have done,austen-emma
i hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation he is a very liberal thanker with his thousands and tens of thousands happier than i deserve,austen-emma
that was your name for him was it,austen-emma
and now let me talk to you of something else,austen-emma
while her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible for her,austen-emma
mr woodhouse taken from hartfield no he felt that it ought not to be attempted,austen-emma
she felt that in quitting donwell he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits that in living constantly with her father and in no house of his own there would be much very much to be borne with,austen-emma
i am sure william larkins will not like it,austen-emma
this proposal of his this plan of marrying and continuing at hartfield the more she contemplated it the more pleasing it became,austen-emma
she would be a loser in every way,austen-emma
mr knightley always so kind so feeling so truly considerate for every body would never deserve to be less worshipped than now and it really was too much to hope even of harriet that she could be in love with more than men in one year,austen-emma
harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed without reproaches or apparent sense of ill usage and yet emma fancied there was a something of resentment a something bordering on it in her style which increased the desirableness of their being separate it might be only her own consciousness but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke,austen-emma
the difference of harriet at mrs goddard s or in london made perhaps an unreasonable difference in emma s sensations but she could not think of her in london without objects of curiosity and employment which must be averting the past and carrying her out of herself,austen-emma
it would be a satisfaction but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing jane might communicate,austen-emma
mrs bates and mrs elton were together,austen-emma
we can finish this some other time you know,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
now i say my dear in case for read mum,austen-emma
no cautious as a minister of state,austen-emma
do not you think miss woodhouse our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered do not you think her cure does perry the highest credit here was a side glance of great meaning at jane,austen-emma
i have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you miss woodhouse she shortly afterwards began since the party to box hill,austen-emma
what say you both to our collecting the same party and exploring to box hill again while the fine weather lasts it must be the same party you know quite the same party not exception,austen-emma
and from her great her more than commonly thankful delight towards mrs elton for being there emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards jane from the vicarage quarter which was now graciously overcome after a few whispers indeed which placed it beyond a guess mrs elton speaking louder said,austen-emma
elton that will be a favour indeed,austen-emma
and putting up her hand to screen her words from emma a congratulatory visit you know oh,austen-emma
emma would not have smiled for the world and only said is mr elton gone on foot to donwell he will have a hot walk,austen-emma
said emma,austen-emma
we never heard of such things at maple grove,austen-emma
you clever creature that s very true,austen-emma
the wish of distinguishing her as far as civility permitted was very evident though it could not often proceed beyond a look,austen-emma
mr elton was so hot and tired that all this wit seemed thrown away,austen-emma
after the note i sent him this morning and the message he returned that he should certainly be at home till one,austen-emma
i assure you i am not at all pleased,austen-emma
i cannot imagine said mrs elton feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do i cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you of all people in the world,austen-emma
he did not know what was come to his master lately he said but he could hardly ever get the speech of him,austen-emma
it is as well perhaps that i have not had the possibility,austen-emma
you could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest,austen-emma
oh,austen-emma
i feel that all the apologies should be on my side,austen-emma
and the next news i suppose will be that we are to lose you just as i begin to know you,austen-emma
nothing can be actually settled yet perhaps replied emma smiling but excuse me it must be thought of,austen-emma
thank you thank you this is just what i wanted to be assured of oh,austen-emma
she would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her hereafter with either of isabella s sons but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best,austen-emma
poor child,austen-emma
i who am owing all my happiness to would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them,austen-emma
you must have done well,austen-emma
i could not think about you so much without doating on you faults and all and by dint of fancying so many errors have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least,austen-emma
how often when you were a girl have you said to me with one of your saucy looks mr knightley i am going to do so and so papa says i may or i have miss taylor s leave something which you knew i did not approve,austen-emma
you always called me mr knightley and from habit it has not so very formal a sound and yet it is formal,austen-emma
impossible i never can call you any thing but mr,austen-emma
this on his side might merely proceed from her not being thought of but emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy and a suspicion from some appearances that their friendship were declining,austen-emma
emma s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on by harriet s being to stay longer her fortnight was likely to be a month at least,austen-emma
emma accepted it with a very eager hand with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned,austen-emma
it is very plain that he considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side but that he is not without hope of my growing in time as worthy of your affection as you think me already,austen-emma
emma my dear emma,austen-emma
i wish i may not sink into poor emma with him at once his tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther,austen-emma
he had no idea of me,austen-emma
i believe i did not play with the children quite so much as usual,austen-emma
she must not appear to think it a misfortune with all the spirits she could command she prepared him first for something strange and then in a few words said that if his consent and approbation could be obtained which she trusted would be attended with no difficulty since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all she and mr knightley meant to marry by which means hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person s company whom she knew he loved next to his daughters and mrs weston best in the world,austen-emma
that was all very true,austen-emma
how to settle the claims of enscombe and hartfield had been a continual impediment less acknowledged by mr weston than by herself but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying those matters will take care of themselves the young people will find a way,austen-emma
mrs weston with her baby on her knee indulging in such reflections as these was one of the happiest women in the world,austen-emma
only let me be told when i may speak out i wonder whether jane has any suspicion,austen-emma
in general it was a very well approved match,austen-emma
poor fellow sad business for him she was extremely concerned for though very eccentric he had a thousand good qualities how could he be so taken in did not think him at all in love not in the least poor knightley there would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him how happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him,austen-emma
it would never do,austen-emma
it was an alarming change and emma was thinking of it one morning as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her when mr knightley came in and distressing thoughts were put by,austen-emma
i do not know which it ought to be called,austen-emma
indeed,austen-emma
her cheeks flushed at the name and she felt afraid of something though she knew not what,austen-emma
you are prepared for the worst i see and very bad it is,austen-emma
he left me not half an hour ago,austen-emma
you mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself,austen-emma
i mean that he has done it answered mr knightley with smiling but determined decision and been accepted,austen-emma
i never was more surprized but it does not make me unhappy i assure you how how has it been possible,austen-emma
my friend robert could not resist,austen-emma
he stopped emma dared not attempt any immediate reply,austen-emma
his situation is an evil but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend and i will answer for your thinking better and better of him as you know him more,austen-emma
i think harriet is doing extremely well,austen-emma
how peculiarly unprepared i was for i had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him much more than she was before,austen-emma
it could not be otherwise,austen-emma
i always deserve the best treatment because i never put up with any other and therefore you must give me a plain direct answer,austen-emma
could i mention any thing more fit to be done than to go to mrs goddard,austen-emma
i hope so for at that time i was a fool,austen-emma
sometimes indeed i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor martin s cause which was never the case but from all my observations i am convinced of her being an artless amiable girl with very good notions very seriously good principles and placing her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life much of this i have no doubt she may thank you for,austen-emma
their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father,austen-emma
her father s business was to announce james s being gone out to put the horses to preparatory to their now daily drive to randalls and she had therefore an immediate excuse for disappearing,austen-emma
serious she was very serious in her thankfulness and in her resolutions and yet there was no preventing a laugh sometimes in the very midst of them,austen-emma
it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin,austen-emma
they arrived mrs,austen-emma
in half a minute they were in the room,austen-emma
i hope time has not made you less willing to pardon,austen-emma
is not she looking well,austen-emma
the shame he answered is all mine or ought to be,austen-emma
i was once very near and i wish i had it would have been better,austen-emma
do not you pity me,austen-emma
let me return your congratulations i assure you that i have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction he is a man whom i cannot presume to praise,austen-emma
so peculiarly the lady in it just colour enough for beauty,austen-emma
i do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you had very great amusement in tricking us all i am sure you had i am sure it was a consolation to you,austen-emma
i am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you to feel that you were taking us all in perhaps i am the readier to suspect because to tell you the truth i think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation,austen-emma
no not true on your side,austen-emma
observe her eyes as she is looking up at my father you will be glad to hear inclining his head and whispering seriously that my uncle means to give her all my aunt s jewels,austen-emma
how delighted i am to see you again,austen-emma
perhaps she ought to be ashamed but mr weston had been almost as uneasy as herself in ten minutes however the child had been perfectly well again,austen-emma
frank churchill caught the name,austen-emma
perry has he been here this morning and how does he travel now has he set up his carriage,austen-emma
i see it in her cheek her smile her vain attempt to frown,austen-emma
he had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly but emma s feelings were chiefly with jane in the argument and on leaving randalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men she felt that pleased as she had been to see frank churchill and really regarding him as she did with friendship she had never been more sensible of mr knightley s high superiority of character,austen-emma
harriet was a little distressed did look a little foolish at first but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly and self deceived before her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words and leave her without a care for the past and with the fullest exultation in the present and future for as to her friend s approbation emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at astley s and the dinner the next day she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight,austen-emma
no objection was raised on the father s side the young man was treated liberally it was all as it should be and as emma became acquainted with robert martin who was now introduced at hartfield she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend,austen-emma
harriet necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins was less and less at hartfield which was not to be regretted the intimacy between her and emma must sink their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill and fortunately what ought to be and must be seemed already beginning and in the most gradual natural manner,austen-emma
but mr woodhouse how was mr woodhouse to be induced to consent he who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event,austen-emma
in this state of suspense they were befriended not by any sudden illumination of mr woodhouse s mind or any wonderful change of his nervous system but by the operation of the same system in another way mrs weston s poultry house was robbed one night of all her turkeys evidently by the ingenuity of man,austen-emma
the wedding was very much like other weddings where the parties have no taste for finery or parade and mrs elton from the particulars detailed by her husband thought it all extremely shabby and very inferior to her own very little white satin very few lace veils a most pitiful business selina would stare when she heard of it,austen-emma
sir walter elliot of kellynch hall in somersetshire was a man who for his own amusement never took up any book but the baronetage there he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in a distressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents there any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century and there if every other leaf were powerless he could read his own history with an interest which never failed,austen-persuasion
precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer s hands but sir walter had improved it by adding for the information of himself and his family these words after the date of mary s birth married december 16 1810 charles son and heir of charles musgrove esq,austen-persuasion
he had been remarkably handsome in his youth and at fifty four was still a very fine man,austen-persuasion
three girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited silly father,austen-persuasion
be it known then that sir walter like a good father having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters sake,austen-persuasion
to lady russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valued god daughter favourite and friend,austen-persuasion
it sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty nine than she was ten years before and generally speaking if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely any charm is lost,austen-persuasion
for thirteen years had she been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at home and leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately after lady russell out of all the drawing rooms and dining rooms in the country,austen-persuasion
she had had a disappointment moreover which that book and especially the history of her own family must ever present the remembrance of,austen-persuasion
he was invited to kellynch hall he was talked of and expected all the rest of the year but he never came,austen-persuasion
his disapprobation was expressed but apparently very little regarded,austen-persuasion
the disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring have been got over had he not done worse but he had as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends they had been informed spoken most disrespectfully of them all most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to and the honours which were hereafter to be his own,austen-persuasion
she knew that when he now took up the baronetage it was to drive the heavy bills of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hints of mr shepherd his agent from his thoughts,austen-persuasion
does it occur to you that there is any one article in which we can retrench,austen-persuasion
there was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose of but had every acre been alienable it would have made no difference,austen-persuasion
chapter 2,austen-persuasion
she was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable of strong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notions of decorum and with manners that were held a standard of good breeding,austen-persuasion
she drew up plans of economy she made exact calculations and she did what nobody else thought of doing she consulted anne who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question,austen-persuasion
if he will adopt these regulations in seven years he will be clear and i hope we may be able to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall has a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions and that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far from lessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principle,austen-persuasion
this was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceeding his friends to be urging him,austen-persuasion
how anne s more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little consequence,austen-persuasion
to live no longer with the decencies even of a private gentleman,austen-persuasion
it did not appear to him that sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support,austen-persuasion
a small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still have lady russell s society still be near mary and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the object of her ambition,austen-persuasion
two material advantages of bath over london had of course been given all their weight its more convenient distance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russell s spending some part of every winter there and to the very great satisfaction of lady russell whose first views on the projected change had been for bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe that they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there,austen-persuasion
lady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to think it must suit them all and as to her young friend s health by passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodge every danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which must do both health and spirits good,austen-persuasion
the undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one part and a very material part of the scheme which had been happily engrafted on the beginning,austen-persuasion
mr shepherd had once mentioned the word advertise but never dared approach it again,austen-persuasion
it was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returned after an unprosperous marriage to her father s house with the additional burden of two children,austen-persuasion
from situation mrs clay was in lady russell s estimate a very unequal and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion and a removal that would leave mrs clay behind and bring a choice of more suitable intimates within miss elliot s reach was therefore an object of first rate importance,austen-persuasion
could not be a better time sir walter for having a choice of tenants very responsible tenants,austen-persuasion
mr shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added,austen-persuasion
but soon afterwards rising and pacing the room he observed sarcastically,austen-persuasion
everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of,austen-persuasion
the park would be open to him of course and few navy officers or men of any other description can have had such a range but what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure grounds is another thing,austen-persuasion
your interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands,austen-persuasion
sailors work hard enough for their comforts we must all allow,austen-persuasion
indeed,austen-persuasion
a man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than in any other line,austen-persuasion
cried sir basil it is admiral baldwin,austen-persuasion
i never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea faring life can do but to a degree i know it is the same with them all they are all knocked about and exposed to every climate and every weather till they are not fit to be seen,austen-persuasion
the sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimes i have observed it they soon lose the look of youth,austen-persuasion
it seemed as if mr shepherd in this anxiety to bespeak sir walter s good will towards a naval officer as tenant had been gifted with foresight for the very first application for the house was from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwards fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton and indeed he had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondent,austen-persuasion
he is a rear admiral of the white,austen-persuasion
he was a married man and without children the very state to be wished for,austen-persuasion
bless me,austen-persuasion
i have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i remember no gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trent,austen-persuasion
very odd indeed,austen-persuasion
wentworth was the very name,austen-persuasion
wentworth,austen-persuasion
one wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common,austen-persuasion
i have let my house to admiral croft would sound extremely well very much better than to any mere mr a mr save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needs a note of explanation,austen-persuasion
chapter 4,austen-persuasion
it would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the other or which had been the happiest she in receiving his declarations and proposals or he in having them accepted,austen-persuasion
anne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mind to throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himself to recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chances of a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing away which she grieved to think of,austen-persuasion
but he was confident that he should soon be rich full of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a ship and soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wanted,austen-persuasion
it only added a dangerous character to himself,austen-persuasion
young and gentle as she was it might yet have been possible to withstand her father s ill will though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister but lady russell whom she had always loved and relied on could not with such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of manner be continually advising her in vain,austen-persuasion
he had left the country in consequence,austen-persuasion
no second attachment the only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cure at her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mind the fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the society around them,austen-persuasion
she was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home and every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fears delays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of it and this she fully believed had the usual share had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs without reference to the actual results of their case which as it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on,austen-persuasion
she had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority but she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancy she had no reason to believe him married,austen-persuasion
she often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the crofts and their business no evil,austen-persuasion
with these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herself and the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynch and mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipated need not involve any particular awkwardness,austen-persuasion
the house and grounds and furniture were approved the crofts were approved terms time every thing and every body was right and mr shepherd s clerks were set to work without there having been a single preliminary difference to modify of all that this indenture sheweth,austen-persuasion
lady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any use or any importance in the choice of the house which they were going to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might convey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagements of her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeks she was unable to give the full invitation she wished and anne though dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glare of bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the autumnal months in the country did not think that everything considered she wished to remain,austen-persuasion
to be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least better than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad to be thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country and her own dear country readily agreed to stay,austen-persuasion
with a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledge which she often wished less of her father s character she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible,austen-persuasion
she spoke and seemed only to offend,austen-persuasion
but poor mrs clay who with all her merits can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poor mrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety,austen-persuasion
you must have heard him notice mrs clay s freckles,austen-persuasion
elizabeth though resenting the suspicion might yet be made observant by it,austen-persuasion
their respectability was as dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had become precious by habit,austen-persuasion
she knew the ways of uppercross as well as those of kellynch,austen-persuasion
in person she was inferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reached the dignity of being a fine girl,austen-persuasion
i have not seen a creature the whole morning,austen-persuasion
so lady russell would not get out,austen-persuasion
i have not seen him since seven o clock,austen-persuasion
yes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good,austen-persuasion
i can give you no account of them,austen-persuasion
i never want them i assure you,austen-persuasion
my dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself,austen-persuasion
more than i can recollect in a moment but i can tell you some,austen-persuasion
but all these things took up a great deal of time,austen-persuasion
i have made no enquiries because i concluded you must have been obliged to give up the party,austen-persuasion
i am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant party,austen-persuasion
so there was i crowded into the back seat with henrietta and louise and i think it very likely that my illness to day may be owing to it,austen-persuasion
said she when they were ready,austen-persuasion
but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible,austen-persuasion
oh,austen-persuasion
mr and mrs musgrove were a very good sort of people friendly and hospitable not much educated and not at all elegant,austen-persuasion
they were received with great cordiality,austen-persuasion
she had never been staying there before without being struck by it or without wishing that other elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs which at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest yet with all this experience she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her for certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeks she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgrove so miss anne sir walter and your sister are gone and what part of bath do you think they will settle in,austen-persuasion
she acknowledged it to be very fitting that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of discourse and hoped ere long to become a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into,austen-persuasion
charles musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation or grace to make the past as they were connected together at all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time anne could believe with lady russell that a more equal match might have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness rationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits,austen-persuasion
i could manage them very well if it were not for mary s interference was what anne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in but when listening in turn to mary s reproach of charles spoils the children so that i cannot get them into any order she never had the smallest temptation to say very true,austen-persuasion
mary s declaration was i hate sending the children to the great house though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them for she humours and indulges them to such a degree and gives them so much trash and sweet things that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day,austen-persuasion
it is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them,austen-persuasion
i assure you miss anne it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as i otherwise should,austen-persuasion
if jemima were not the trustiest steadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil her for she tells me they are always tempting her to take a walk with them,austen-persuasion
nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mamma but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it,austen-persuasion
her own spirits improved by change of place and subject by being removed three miles from kellynch mary s ailments lessened by having a constant companion and their daily intercourse with the other family since there was neither superior affection confidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it was rather an advantage,austen-persuasion
in music she had been always used to feel alone in the world and mr and mrs musgrove s fond partiality for their own daughters performance and total indifference to any other person s gave her much more pleasure for their sakes than mortification for her own,austen-persuasion
there was a family of cousins within a walk of uppercross in less affluent circumstances who depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures they would come at any time and help play at anything or dance anywhere and anne very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post played country dances to them by the hour together a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrove more than anything else and often drew this compliment well done miss anne,austen-persuasion
michaelmas came and now anne s heart must be in kellynch again,austen-persuasion
the crofts took possession with true naval alertness and were to be visited,austen-persuasion
she wished however to see the crofts and was glad to be within when the visit was returned,austen-persuasion
anne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration towards herself in all that related to kellynch and it pleased her especially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute in the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs croft s side to give a bias of any sort,austen-persuasion
added mrs croft,austen-persuasion
he was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys clinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets c to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun anne was left to persuade herself as well as she could that the same brother must still be in question,austen-persuasion
i am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma are out of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so much of poor richard,austen-persuasion
and upon looking over his letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man and her head is quite full of it and of poor richard,austen-persuasion
in each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yet so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships that it had made scarcely any impression at the time and that mrs musgrove should have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollection of the name of wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of those extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur,austen-persuasion
since he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself to be insensible on such points,austen-persuasion
it had been a great disappointment to mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed so impatient was he to shew his gratitude by seeing captain wentworth under his own roof and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars,austen-persuasion
his collar bone was found to be dislocated and such injury received in the back as roused the most alarming ideas,austen-persuasion
and in short he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace that they could assure them all their heads were both turned by him and off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparently more full of captain wentworth than of little charles,austen-persuasion
no indeed charles i cannot bear to have you go away,austen-persuasion
this was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in him who could be of no use at home to shut himself up,austen-persuasion
anne will send for me if anything is the matter,austen-persuasion
i knew how it would be,austen-persuasion
talks of his being going on so well,austen-persuasion
i am not at all equal to it,austen-persuasion
i perfectly understand mr robinson s directions and have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husband,austen-persuasion
but could you be comfortable yourself to be spending the whole evening away from the poor boy,austen-persuasion
i was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different to day,austen-persuasion
cried mary her eyes brightening,austen-persuasion
you who have not a mother s feelings are a great deal the properest person,austen-persuasion
an excellent thought of yours indeed anne,austen-persuasion
i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at home than you are,austen-persuasion
anne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction was at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening when the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable and this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits,austen-persuasion
he must be either indifferent or unwilling,austen-persuasion
anne understood it,austen-persuasion
and it was soon over,austen-persuasion
it is over,austen-persuasion
they had met,austen-persuasion
what might not eight years do,austen-persuasion
now how were his sentiments to be read,austen-persuasion
henrietta asked him what he thought of you when they went away and he said you were so altered he should not have known you again,austen-persuasion
she had already acknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently let him think of her as he would,austen-persuasion
yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them,austen-persuasion
she had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided confident temper could not endure,austen-persuasion
her power with him was gone for ever,austen-persuasion
yes here i am sophia quite ready to make a foolish match,austen-persuasion
his bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice and anne elliot was not out of his thoughts when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with,austen-persuasion
chapter 8,austen-persuasion
there must be the same immediate association of thought though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain,austen-persuasion
with the exception perhaps of admiral and mrs croft who seemed particularly attached and happy anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples there could have been no two hearts so open no tastes so similar no feelings so in unison no countenances so beloved,austen-persuasion
from thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisper of mrs musgrove s who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying,austen-persuasion
your first was the asp i remember we will look for the asp,austen-persuasion
reported fit for home service for a year or two and so i was sent off to the west indies,austen-persuasion
phoo,austen-persuasion
he knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time,austen-persuasion
to be sure you did,austen-persuasion
i had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember and which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourself,austen-persuasion
i knew that we should either go to the bottom together or that she would be the making of me and i never had two days of foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigate i wanted,austen-persuasion
and so then i suppose said mrs musgrove in a low voice as if thinking aloud so then he went away to the laconia and there he met with our poor boy,austen-persuasion
oh,austen-persuasion
those were pleasant days when i had the laconia,austen-persuasion
he had a wife,austen-persuasion
and i am sure sir,austen-persuasion
poor dear fellow,austen-persuasion
there was a momentary expression in captain wentworth s face at this speech a certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth which convinced anne that instead of sharing in mrs musgrove s kind wishes as to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him but it was too transient an indulgence of self amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa on which she and mrs musgrove were sitting took a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her in a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent s feelings,austen-persuasion
a large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction as the most graceful set of limbs in the world,austen-persuasion
i am glad i was not a week later then,austen-persuasion
there can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high and this is what i do,austen-persuasion
but i cannot believe it of you,austen-persuasion
nothing to the purpose replied her brother,austen-persuasion
i would assist any brother officer s wife that i could and i would bring anything of harville s from the world s end if he wanted it,austen-persuasion
my dear frederick you are talking quite idly,austen-persuasion
ah,austen-persuasion
now i have done cried captain wentworth,austen-persuasion
what a great traveller you must have been ma am,austen-persuasion
we do not call bermuda or bahama you know the west indies,austen-persuasion
thank god,austen-persuasion
aye to be sure,austen-persuasion
i know what it is for mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad when they are over and he is safe back again,austen-persuasion
the miss hayters the females of the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admitted to the honour of being in love with him and as for henrietta and louisa they both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing but the continued appearance of the most perfect good will between themselves could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals,austen-persuasion
she had rather play,austen-persuasion
i beg your pardon madam this is your seat and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative he was not to be induced to sit down again,austen-persuasion
he had intended on first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshire and visit the brother settled in that country but the attractions of uppercross induced him to put this off,austen-persuasion
it was unvarying warm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not more than established when a certain charles hayter returned among them to be a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain wentworth very much in the way,austen-persuasion
they had each had money but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence,austen-persuasion
henrietta fully thought so herself before captain wentworth came but from that time cousin charles had been very much forgotten,austen-persuasion
charles gave it for louisa mary for henrietta but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful,austen-persuasion
upon my word it would replied mary,austen-persuasion
that would be a noble thing indeed for henrietta,austen-persuasion
she looked down very decidedly upon the hayters and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed very sad for herself and her children,austen-persuasion
a most improper match for miss musgrove of uppercross,austen-persuasion
i grant you that any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henrietta and indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possible but he is a very good natured good sort of a fellow and whenever winthrop comes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of it and live in a very different sort of way and with that property he will never be a contemptible man good freehold property,austen-persuasion
and as to captain wentworth s liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsense to say so for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the best,austen-persuasion
as to captain wentworth s views she deemed it of more consequence that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering the happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honour than that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henrietta,austen-persuasion
he had been absent only two sundays and when they parted had left her interested even to the height of his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy and obtaining that of uppercross instead,austen-persuasion
louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirley she was at a window looking out for captain wentworth and even henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation,austen-persuasion
the surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliot deprived his manners of their usual composure he started and could only say i thought the miss musgroves had been here mrs musgrove told me i should find them here before he walked to the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behave,austen-persuasion
she only attempted to say how do you do,austen-persuasion
the younger boy a remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the door opened for him by some one without made his determined appearance among them and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away,austen-persuasion
you are extremely troublesome,austen-persuasion
but not a bit did walter stir,austen-persuasion
his kindness in stepping forward to her relief the manner the silence in which it had passed the little particulars of the circumstance with the conviction soon forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather sought to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants produced such a confusion of varying but very painful agitation as she could not recover from till enabled by the entrance of mary and the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares and leave the room,austen-persuasion
but neither charles hayter s feelings nor anybody s feelings could interest her till she had a little better arranged her own,austen-persuasion
they were more in love with him yet there it was not love,austen-persuasion
it was the highest satisfaction to her to believe captain wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he was occasioning,austen-persuasion
three days had passed without his coming once to uppercross a most decided change,austen-persuasion
it was a very fine november day and the miss musgroves came through the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to say that they were going to take a long walk and therefore concluded mary could not like to go with them and when mary immediately replied with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker oh yes i should like to join you very much i am very fond of a long walk anne felt persuaded by the looks of the two girls that it was precisely what they did not wish and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce of everything being to be communicated and everything being to be done together however undesired and inconvenient,austen-persuasion
just as they were setting off the gentlemen returned,austen-persuasion
her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedges and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness that season which had drawn from every poet worthy of being read some attempt at description or some lines of feeling,austen-persuasion
this distinction appeared to increase and there was one speech of louisa s which struck her,austen-persuasion
i wonder whereabouts they will upset to day,austen-persuasion
if i loved a man as she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should ever separate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else,austen-persuasion
anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again,austen-persuasion
winthrop without beauty and without dignity was stretched before them an indifferent house standing low and hemmed in by the barns and buildings of a farm yard,austen-persuasion
henrietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin charles walking along any path or leaning against any gate was ready to do as mary wished but no,austen-persuasion
no indeed,austen-persuasion
but i assure you i have never been in the house above twice in my life,austen-persuasion
mary sat down for a moment but it would not do she was sure louisa had found a better seat somewhere else and she would go on till she overtook her,austen-persuasion
what anne first heard was,austen-persuasion
no i have no idea of being so easily persuaded,austen-persuasion
happy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand,austen-persuasion
but this no doubt you have been always doing,austen-persuasion
to exemplify a beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strength has outlived all the storms of autumn,austen-persuasion
he had done and was unanswered,austen-persuasion
before they were beyond her hearing however louisa spoke again,austen-persuasion
after a moment s pause captain wentworth said,austen-persuasion
i do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the time but i believe about a year before he married mary,austen-persuasion
her own emotions still kept her fixed,austen-persuasion
her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give,austen-persuasion
in a long strip of meadow land where there was ample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct parties and to that party of the three which boasted least animation and least complaisance anne necessarily belonged,austen-persuasion
upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired it would save her a full mile and they were going through uppercross,austen-persuasion
miss elliot i am sure you are tired cried mrs croft,austen-persuasion
anne was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to decline she was not allowed to proceed,austen-persuasion
this little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before,austen-persuasion
her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given,austen-persuasion
ay this comes of the peace,austen-persuasion
i had known you by character however long before,austen-persuasion
and very nice young ladies they both are i hardly know one from the other,austen-persuasion
but by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut nor ran foul of a dung cart and anne with some amusement at their style of driving which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs found herself safely deposited by them at the cottage,austen-persuasion
she wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing captain wentworth at the hall those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell and captain wentworth never meeting anywhere,austen-persuasion
captain wentworth after being unseen and unheard of at uppercross for two whole days appeared again among them to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away,austen-persuasion
the young people were all wild to see lyme,austen-persuasion
after securing accommodations and ordering a dinner at one of the inns the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly down to the sea,austen-persuasion
captain wentworth turned in to call on his friend the others walked on and he was to join them on the cobb,austen-persuasion
fortune came his prize money as lieutenant being great promotion too came at last but fanny harville did not live to know it,austen-persuasion
captain harville had taken his present house for half a year his taste and his health and his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpensive and by the sea and the grandeur of the country and the retirement of lyme in the winter appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick s state of mind,austen-persuasion
he will rally again and be happy with another,austen-persuasion
captain harville though not equalling captain wentworth in manners was a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obliging,austen-persuasion
on quitting the cobb they all went in doors with their new friends and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart could think capable of accommodating so many,austen-persuasion
he drew he varnished he carpentered he glued he made toys for the children he fashioned new netting needles and pins with improvements and if everything else was done sat down to his large fishing net at one corner of the room,austen-persuasion
he ventured among them again however though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth of the party in general,austen-persuasion
his looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusion to his situation she was emboldened to go on and feeling in herself the right of seniority of mind she ventured to recommend a larger allowance of prose in his daily study and on being requested to particularize mentioned such works of our best moralists such collections of the finest letters such memoirs of characters of worth and suffering as occurred to her at the moment as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances,austen-persuasion
they went to the sands to watch the flowing of the tide which a fine south easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted,austen-persuasion
he declares himself that coming to lyme for a month did him more good than all the medicine he took and that being by the sea always makes him feel young again,austen-persuasion
she has cousins here you know and many acquaintance which would make it cheerful for her and i am sure she would be glad to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand in case of his having another seizure,austen-persuasion
my only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish,austen-persuasion
anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech and entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was good of a lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescence,austen-persuasion
i am afraid of her as i have told you before quite afraid of her because she is so very clever but i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbour at uppercross,austen-persuasion
they ascended and passed him and as they passed anne s face caught his eye and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible of,austen-persuasion
after attending louisa through her business and loitering about a little longer they returned to the inn and anne in passing afterwards quickly from her own chamber to their dining room had nearly run against the very same gentleman as he came out of an adjoining apartment,austen-persuasion
anne felt that she should like to know who he was,austen-persuasion
ah,austen-persuasion
yes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last night from sidmouth,austen-persuasion
cried mary it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliot it must indeed,austen-persuasion
anne must not it be our mr elliot,austen-persuasion
you see,austen-persuasion
but anne only conceive how extraordinary,austen-persuasion
i hardly looked at him i was looking at the horses but i think he had something of the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me,austen-persuasion
at the same time however it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good sense,austen-persuasion
the offence which had been given her father many years back she knew elizabeth s particular share in it she suspected and that mr elliot s idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt,austen-persuasion
their conversation the preceding evening did not disincline him to seek her again and they walked together some time talking as before of mr scott and lord byron and still as unable as before and as unable as any other two readers to think exactly alike of the merits of either till something occasioned an almost general change amongst their party and instead of captain benwick she had captain harville by her side,austen-persuasion
no said anne that i can easily believe to be impossible but in time perhaps we know what time does in every case of affliction and you must remember captain harville that your friend may yet be called a young mourner only last summer i understand,austen-persuasion
there the news must follow him but who was to tell it,austen-persuasion
that s what he did and nobody else could have saved poor james,austen-persuasion
anne found captain benwick again drawing near her,austen-persuasion
the hardness of the pavement for her feet made him less willing upon the present occasion he did it however,austen-persuasion
captain wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her in his arms looking on her with a face as pallid as her own in an agony of silence,austen-persuasion
were the first words which burst from captain wentworth in a tone of despair and as if all his own strength were gone,austen-persuasion
captain benwick obeyed and charles at the same moment disengaging himself from his wife they were both with him and louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them and everything was done that anne had prompted but in vain while captain wentworth staggering against the wall for his support exclaimed in the bitterest agony,austen-persuasion
he caught the word it seemed to rouse him at once and saying only true true a surgeon this instant was darting away when anne eagerly suggested,austen-persuasion
anne attending with all the strength and zeal and thought which instinct supplied to henrietta still tried at intervals to suggest comfort to the others tried to quiet mary to animate charles to assuage the feelings of captain wentworth,austen-persuasion
had not she better be carried to the inn,austen-persuasion
by this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen and boatmen about the cobb and many were collected near them to be useful if wanted at any rate to enjoy the sight of a dead young lady nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fine as the first report,austen-persuasion
she must be taken to their house all must go to their house and await the surgeon s arrival there,austen-persuasion
the surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible,austen-persuasion
was uttered by captain wentworth anne was sure could never be forgotten by her nor the sight of him afterwards as he sat near a table leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them,austen-persuasion
that louisa must remain where she was however distressing to her friends to be involving the harvilles in such trouble did not admit a doubt,austen-persuasion
they were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more and yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maid s room or swinging a cot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of not finding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish to stay though with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove there need not be the least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harville s care entirely,austen-persuasion
uppercross the necessity of some one s going to uppercross the news to be conveyed how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrove the lateness of the morning an hour already gone since they ought to have been off the impossibility of being in tolerable time,austen-persuasion
musgrove either you or i must go,austen-persuasion
the usefulness of her staying,austen-persuasion
but as to the rest as to the others if one stays to assist mrs harville i think it need be only one,austen-persuasion
she coloured deeply and he recollected himself and moved away,austen-persuasion
though it was rather desirable that mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay yet the time required by the uppercross horses to take them back would be a dreadful extension of suspense and captain wentworth proposed and charles musgrove agreed that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn and leave mr musgrove s carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of louisa s night,austen-persuasion
and to go home without charles too without her husband,austen-persuasion
there she had listened to henrietta s schemes for dr shirley s leaving uppercross farther on she had first seen mr elliot a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but louisa or those who were wrapt up in her welfare,austen-persuasion
in the mean while she was in the carriage,austen-persuasion
in general his voice and manner were studiously calm,austen-persuasion
that i had not given way to her at the fatal moment,austen-persuasion
she thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character,austen-persuasion
in a low cautious voice he said,austen-persuasion
do you think this is a good plan,austen-persuasion
chapter 13,austen-persuasion
charles came a few hours afterwards to bring a later and more particular account,austen-persuasion
he and mary had been persuaded to go early to their inn last night,austen-persuasion
it would be going only to multiply trouble to the others and increase his own distress and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon,austen-persuasion
the intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger,austen-persuasion
and so much was said in this way that anne thought she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to lyme at once,austen-persuasion
if louisa recovered it would all be well again,austen-persuasion
scenes had passed in uppercross which made it precious,austen-persuasion
her first return was to resume her place in the modern and elegant apartments of the lodge and to gladden the eyes of its mistress,austen-persuasion
the subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynch and which she had felt slighted and been compelled to smother among the musgroves were now become but of secondary interest,austen-persuasion
they must speak of the accident at lyme,austen-persuasion
lady russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happy but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in pleased contempt that the man who at twenty three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an anne elliot should eight years afterwards be charmed by a louisa musgrove,austen-persuasion
anne did not shrink from it on the contrary she truly felt as she said in observing,austen-persuasion
in such moments anne had no power of saying to herself these rooms ought to belong only to us,austen-persuasion
no except when she thought of her mother and remembered where she had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that description to heave,austen-persuasion
as to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady sensible women whose judgements had to work on ascertained events and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence that its effects were most alarming and that it was frightful to think how long miss musgrove s recovery might yet be doubtful and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter,austen-persuasion
admiral croft s manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russell but they delighted anne,austen-persuasion
get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it,austen-persuasion
but checking himself you will not think it a good place for yours were always kept in the butler s room,austen-persuasion
we have made very few changes either continued the admiral after thinking a moment,austen-persuasion
you will tell sir walter what we have done and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had,austen-persuasion
such a number of looking glasses,austen-persuasion
the next time you write to your good father miss elliot pray give him my compliments and mrs croft s and say that we are settled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to find with the place,austen-persuasion
lady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each other but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present for when it was returned the crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks to visit their connexions in the north of the county and probably might not be at home again before lady russell would be removing to bath,austen-persuasion
they had left louisa beginning to sit up but her head though clear was exceedingly weak and her nerves susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness and though she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear the removal home and her father and mother who must return in time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidays had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them,austen-persuasion
she had been taken to charmouth too and she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercross and all this joined to the sense of being so very useful had made really an agreeable fortnight,austen-persuasion
i do not know what he would be at,austen-persuasion
it was all your doing turning to anne,austen-persuasion
she boldly acknowledged herself flattered and continued her enquiries,austen-persuasion
no admitted charles i do not know that he ever does in a general way but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly,austen-persuasion
oh,austen-persuasion
i am sure you will agree with me,austen-persuasion
so i give you notice lady russell,austen-persuasion
you will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you ma am,austen-persuasion
there we differ mary said anne,austen-persuasion
he is just lady russell s sort,austen-persuasion
do you think lady russell would like that,austen-persuasion
and when he does mary you may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determined not to judge him beforehand,austen-persuasion
his declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me,austen-persuasion
he had not seen louisa and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her from an interview that he did not press for it at all and on the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a week or ten days till her head was stronger,austen-persuasion
he was either less disposed for it than charles had imagined or he was too shy and after giving him a week s indulgence lady russell determined him to be unworthy of the interest which he had been beginning to excite,austen-persuasion
immediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilles whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from the cottage expressly arrived to amuse them,austen-persuasion
but mrs musgrove who got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially again and again for all her attentions to them concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing with a happy glance round the room that after all she had gone through nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home,austen-persuasion
i hope i shall remember in future said lady russell as soon as they were reseated in the carriage not to call at uppercross in the christmas holidays,austen-persuasion
she persisted in a very determined though very silent disinclination for bath caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings smoking in rain without any wish of seeing them better felt their progress through the streets to be however disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad to see her when she arrived,austen-persuasion
if elizabeth and her father did not deceive themselves had been taking much pains to seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connection as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect,austen-persuasion
she was put down in camden place and lady russell then drove to her own lodgings in rivers street,austen-persuasion
a degree of unexpected cordiality however in the welcome she received did her good,austen-persuasion
they were evidently in excellent spirits and she was soon to listen to the causes,austen-persuasion
their house was undoubtedly the best in camden place their drawing rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting up or the taste of the furniture,austen-persuasion
could anne wonder that her father and sister were happy,austen-persuasion
he was not only pardoned they were delighted with him,austen-persuasion
he had never had an idea of throwing himself off he had feared that he was thrown off but knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent,austen-persuasion
the circumstances of his marriage too were found to admit of much extenuation,austen-persuasion
she had sought him,austen-persuasion
mr elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them once evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for they gave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proof of cousinly notice and placing his whole happiness in being on intimate terms in camden place,austen-persuasion
still however she had the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared in mr elliot s wishing after an interval of so many years to be well received by them,austen-persuasion
there might really have been a liking formerly though convenience and accident had drawn him a different way and now that he could afford to please himself he might mean to pay his addresses to her,austen-persuasion
oh,austen-persuasion
they were describing him themselves sir walter especially,austen-persuasion
mr elliot and his friends in marlborough buildings were talked of the whole evening,austen-persuasion
he longed to see her,austen-persuasion
it had been a frosty morning to be sure a sharp frost which hardly one woman in a thousand could stand the test of,austen-persuasion
he had never walked anywhere arm in arm with colonel wallis who was a fine military figure though sandy haired without observing that every woman s eye was upon him every woman s eye was sure to be upon colonel wallis,austen-persuasion
said sir walter in the height of his good humour,austen-persuasion
if i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds and grow coarse i would send her a new hat and pelisse,austen-persuasion
could it be mr elliot,austen-persuasion
mrs clay was right,austen-persuasion
he looked completely astonished but not more astonished than pleased his eyes brightened,austen-persuasion
there could be no doubt of his being a sensible man,austen-persuasion
his regret increased as he listened,austen-persuasion
the notions of a young man of one or two and twenty said he as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing are more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beings in the world,austen-persuasion
when he questioned sir walter and elizabeth began to question also but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt,austen-persuasion
chapter 16,austen-persuasion
she is nothing to me compared with you and she was in full time to hear her father say my dear madam this must not be,austen-persuasion
to your fine mind i well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification,austen-persuasion
had she been using any thing in particular,austen-persuasion
he was surprised at that and added certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are you cannot be better than well or i should recommend gowland the constant use of gowland during the spring months,austen-persuasion
but everything must take its chance,austen-persuasion
as mr elliot became known to her she grew more charitable or more indifferent towards the others,austen-persuasion
he was steady observant moderate candid never run away with by spirits or by selfishness which fancied itself strong feeling and yet with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely and a value for all the felicities of domestic life which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess,austen-persuasion
in lady russell s view it was perfectly natural that mr elliot at a mature time of life should feel it a most desirable object and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people to be on good terms with the head of his family the simplest process in the world of time upon a head naturally clear and only erring in the heyday of youth,austen-persuasion
she could determine nothing at present,austen-persuasion
however it might end he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in bath she saw nobody equal to him and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lyme which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again and to see more of as herself,austen-persuasion
his value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers,austen-persuasion
sir walter had once been in company with the late viscount but had never seen any of the rest of the family and the difficulties of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscount when in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walter s at the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynch,austen-persuasion
she had been at bath the year before and lady russell had heard her spoken of as a charming woman,austen-persuasion
the toils of the business were over the sweets began,austen-persuasion
lady dalrymple had acquired the name of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody,austen-persuasion
you are mistaken said he gently that is not good company that is the best,austen-persuasion
she is fastidious,austen-persuasion
yes sighed anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them,austen-persuasion
well said anne i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place,austen-persuasion
we must feel that every addition to your father s society among his equals or superiors may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him,austen-persuasion
miss hamilton now mrs smith had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her life when it had been most valuable,austen-persuasion
she had had difficulties of every sort to contend with and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legs had made her for the present a cripple,austen-persuasion
she only consulted lady russell who entered thoroughly into her sentiments and was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smith s lodgings in westgate buildings as anne chose to be taken,austen-persuasion
anne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation,austen-persuasion
she had been used to affluence it was gone,austen-persuasion
she watched observed reflected and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only,austen-persuasion
then she had indeed been a pitiable object for she had caught cold on the journey and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain and all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense,austen-persuasion
as soon as i could use my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great amusement and she put me in the way of making these little thread cases pin cushions and card racks which you always find me so busy about and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood,austen-persuasion
hers is a line for seeing human nature and she has a fund of good sense and observation which as a companion make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received the best education in the world know nothing worth attending to,austen-persuasion
women of that class have great opportunities and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to,austen-persuasion
yes said mrs smith more doubtingly sometimes it may though i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe,austen-persuasion
the husband had not been what he ought and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved,austen-persuasion
she has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy all the high priced things i have in hand now,austen-persuasion
they were only asked she was sure because lady dalrymple being kept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationship which had been so pressed on her and she declined on her own account with great alacrity she was engaged to spend the evening with an old schoolfellow,austen-persuasion
a widow mrs smith and who was her husband,austen-persuasion
everything that revolts other people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associations are inviting to you,austen-persuasion
she goes into the warm bath to morrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engaged,austen-persuasion
sir henry russell s widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her arms but still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well known to convey a miss elliot,austen-persuasion
mrs clay who had been present while all this passed now thought it advisable to leave the room and anne could have said much and did long to say a little in defence of her friend s not very dissimilar claims to theirs but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her,austen-persuasion
anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from lady russell,austen-persuasion
lady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliot,austen-persuasion
i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept him i think there would be every possibility of your being happy together,austen-persuasion
my dearest anne it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life,austen-persuasion
the same image of mr elliot speaking for himself brought anne to composure again,austen-persuasion
that he was a sensible man an agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinions seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was all clear enough,austen-persuasion
how could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed,austen-persuasion
she prized the frank the open hearted the eager character beyond all others,austen-persuasion
he endured too well stood too well with every body,austen-persuasion
it was the beginning of february and anne having been a month in bath was growing very eager for news from uppercross and lyme,austen-persuasion
a circumstance to interest her,austen-persuasion
the crofts who rent kellynch,austen-persuasion
they secure an introduction,austen-persuasion
february 1st,austen-persuasion
the holidays however are over at last i believe no children ever had such long ones,austen-persuasion
they are not at all nice children in my opinion but mrs musgrove seems to like them quite as well if not better than her grandchildren,austen-persuasion
the carriage is gone to day to bring louisa and the harvilles to morrow,austen-persuasion
but perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant we might not be invited,austen-persuasion
charles heard it quite by chance they have not had the civility to give me any notice or of offering to take anything,austen-persuasion
mary m,austen-persuasion
in the first place i had a note from mrs croft yesterday offering to convey anything to you a very kind friendly note indeed addressed to me just as it ought i shall therefore be able to make my letter as long as i like,austen-persuasion
i have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little,austen-persuasion
i shall be surprised at least if you ever received a hint of it for i never did,austen-persuasion
charles wonders what captain wentworth will say but if you remember i never thought him attached to louisa i never could see anything of it,austen-persuasion
mary need not have feared her sister s being in any degree prepared for the news,austen-persuasion
sir walter wanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horses and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bath as it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in but had little curiosity beyond,austen-persuasion
gout and decrepitude,austen-persuasion
i do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral croft s time of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this,austen-persuasion
situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousins we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance she might not approve,austen-persuasion
this was sir walter and elizabeth s share of interest in the letter when mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention in an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove and her fine little boys anne was at liberty,austen-persuasion
she could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly,austen-persuasion
the answer soon presented itself,austen-persuasion
she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have received the same compliment,austen-persuasion
he would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast for scott and lord byron nay that was probably learnt already of course they had fallen in love over poetry,austen-persuasion
she had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate,austen-persuasion
he was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal more about the admiral than the admiral ever thought or talked about him,austen-persuasion
lady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning and she never failed to think of them and never failed to see them,austen-persuasion
when he did perceive and acknowledge her however it was done with all his usual frankness and good humour,austen-persuasion
here i am you see staring at a picture,austen-persuasion
what queer fellows your fine painters must be to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless old cockleshell as that,austen-persuasion
can i go anywhere for you or with you,austen-persuasion
yes yes we will have a snug walk together and i have something to tell you as we go along,austen-persuasion
did you say that you had something to tell me sir,austen-persuasion
how d ye do,austen-persuasion
shabby fellows both of them,austen-persuasion
there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandson,austen-persuasion
how do you like bath miss elliot,austen-persuasion
when they were got a little farther anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate,austen-persuasion
that young lady you know that we have all been so concerned for,austen-persuasion
i wish young ladies had not such a number of fine christian names,austen-persuasion
but even then there was something odd in their way of going on,austen-persuasion
but now the matter has take the strangest turn of all for this young lady the same miss musgrove instead of being to marry frederick is to marry james benwick,austen-persuasion
nay most likely they are married already for i do not know what they should wait for,austen-persuasion
an excellent good hearted fellow i assure you a very active zealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhaps for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice,austen-persuasion
anne was caught,austen-persuasion
his sister had a letter from him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had it in a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercross,austen-persuasion
not at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end,austen-persuasion
but what i mean is that i hope there is nothing in captain wentworth s manner of writing to make you suppose he thinks himself ill used by his friend which might appear you know without its being absolutely said,austen-persuasion
no you would not guess from his way of writing that he had ever thought of this miss what s her name,austen-persuasion
poor frederick,austen-persuasion
here are pretty girls enough i am sure,austen-persuasion
before mrs croft had written he was arrived and the very next time anne walked out she saw him,austen-persuasion
her ladyship s carriage was a barouche and did not hold more than four with any comfort,austen-persuasion
but the rain was also a mere trifle to mrs clay she would hardly allow it even to drop at all and her boots were so thick,austen-persuasion
she was lost and when she had scolded back her senses she found the others still waiting for the carriage and mr elliot always obliging just setting off for union street on a commission of mrs clay s,austen-persuasion
she would see if it rained,austen-persuasion
all the overpowering blinding bewildering first effects of strong surprise were over with her,austen-persuasion
she could not have called it either cold or friendly or anything so certainly as embarrassed,austen-persuasion
there was consciousness of some sort or other,austen-persuasion
it was beginning to rain again and altogether there was a delay and a bustle and a talking which must make all the little crowd in the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to convey miss elliot,austen-persuasion
but it rains,austen-persuasion
he will be here in a moment i am sure,austen-persuasion
being all that she had time for as she passed away,austen-persuasion
one can guess what will happen there,austen-persuasion
it is not the fashion to say so but i confess i admire her more than her sister,austen-persuasion
but the men are all wild after miss elliot,austen-persuasion
she could not understand his present feelings whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not and till that point were settled she could not be quite herself,austen-persuasion
he might be only passing through,austen-persuasion
she had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrove was to marry captain benwick,austen-persuasion
no it was not to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite,austen-persuasion
you will wonder said she what has been fixing my eye so long but i was looking after some window curtains which lady alicia and mrs frankland were telling me of last night,austen-persuasion
the theatre or the rooms where he was most likely to be were not fashionable enough for the elliots whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties in which they were getting more and more engaged and anne wearied of such a state of stagnation sick of knowing nothing and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried was quite impatient for the concert evening,austen-persuasion
elizabeth had turned from him lady russell overlooked him her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances she felt that she owed him attention,austen-persuasion
anne named them all,austen-persuasion
but hardly were they so settled when the door opened again and captain wentworth walked in alone,austen-persuasion
while they were speaking a whispering between her father and elizabeth caught her ear,austen-persuasion
i am afraid you must have suffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering you at the time,austen-persuasion
certainly i could have none,austen-persuasion
they have no difficulties to contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delays,austen-persuasion
after clearing his throat however he proceeded thus,austen-persuasion
but i have no reason to suppose it so,austen-persuasion
a man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman,austen-persuasion
about a fortnight,austen-persuasion
the country round lyme is very fine,austen-persuasion
the horror and distress you were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits,austen-persuasion
so much novelty and beauty,austen-persuasion
the others joined them and it was a group in which anne found herself also necessarily included,austen-persuasion
she had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all and to pity every one as being less happy than herself,austen-persuasion
he would look for her he would find her out before the evening were over and at present perhaps it was as well to be asunder,austen-persuasion
anne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room,austen-persuasion
his opinion of louisa musgrove s inferiority an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give his wonder at captain benwick his feelings as to a first strong attachment sentences begun which he could not finish his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance all all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least that anger resentment avoidance were no more and that they were succeeded not merely by friendship and regard but by the tenderness of the past,austen-persuasion
when their places were determined on and they were all properly arranged she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room but he was not her eye could not reach him and the concert being just opening she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way,austen-persuasion
they had a concert bill between them,austen-persuasion
you have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clear comprehensible elegant english,austen-persuasion
for shame,austen-persuasion
indeed,austen-persuasion
i have been acquainted with you by character many years,austen-persuasion
she wondered and questioned him eagerly but in vain,austen-persuasion
anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkford captain wentworth s brother,austen-persuasion
her father and lady dalrymple were speaking,austen-persuasion
irish i dare say,austen-persuasion
before sir walter had reached this point anne s eyes had caught the right direction and distinguished captain wentworth standing among a cluster of men at a little distance,austen-persuasion
he could not have come nearer to her if he would she was so surrounded and shut in but she would rather have caught his eye,austen-persuasion
now she hoped for some beneficial change and after a period of nothing saying amongst the party some of them did decide on going in quest of tea,austen-persuasion
anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance but he never came,austen-persuasion
in re settling themselves there were now many changes the result of which was favourable for her,austen-persuasion
he saw her too yet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her,austen-persuasion
she thought of her father of lady russell,austen-persuasion
it came from mr elliot,austen-persuasion
he must wish her good night he was going he should get home as fast as he could,austen-persuasion
jealousy of mr elliot,austen-persuasion
but alas,austen-persuasion
it was misery to think of mr elliot s attentions,austen-persuasion
in spite of the mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard perhaps compassion,austen-persuasion
their union she believed could not divide her more from other men than their final separation,austen-persuasion
all that she could tell she told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been there and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith who had already heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company,austen-persuasion
the ibbotsons were they there,austen-persuasion
i need not ask after her,austen-persuasion
but happily lady dalrymple always chooses to be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that is for hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seen very little,austen-persuasion
you were a large party in yourselves and you wanted nothing beyond,austen-persuasion
i perfectly see how the hours passed that you had always something agreeable to listen to,austen-persuasion
a blush overspread anne s cheeks,austen-persuasion
she was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend s penetration unable to imagine how any report of captain wentworth could have reached her,austen-persuasion
repeated anne looking up surprised,austen-persuasion
i was not at all aware of this,austen-persuasion
i want your interest with him,austen-persuasion
if in that light there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him i beg you would not hesitate to employ me,austen-persuasion
to be sure by next week i may be allowed to think it all settled and build my own selfish schemes on mr elliot s good fortune,austen-persuasion
mrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiled shook her head and exclaimed,austen-persuasion
it is a thing of course among us that every man is refused till he offers,austen-persuasion
let me recommend mr elliot,austen-persuasion
if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archly mr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about him,austen-persuasion
well my dear miss elliot i hope and trust you will be very happy,austen-persuasion
no said anne i can readily believe all that of my cousin,austen-persuasion
will not this manner of speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to me,austen-persuasion
i assure you mr elliot had not the share which you have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that,austen-persuasion
it first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how much you were together and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way,austen-persuasion
was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid,austen-persuasion
she sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole history,austen-persuasion
shall i mention to him your being in bath,austen-persuasion
i think you spoke of having known mr elliot many years,austen-persuasion
intimately,austen-persuasion
i have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smith s answer given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity,austen-persuasion
there were many things to be taken into the account,austen-persuasion
you might some time or other be differently affected towards him,austen-persuasion
he is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion,austen-persuasion
you must allow for an injured angry woman,austen-persuasion
he was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved him and thought him as good as himself,austen-persuasion
he was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor one he had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman,austen-persuasion
i never knew him myself i only heard of him but there was a something in his conduct then with regard to my father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage which i never could quite reconcile with present times,austen-persuasion
i can satisfy you perhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriage i knew all about it at the time,austen-persuasion
my father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him,austen-persuasion
that was his motive for drawing back i can assure you,austen-persuasion
perhaps cried anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes spoke of me to mr elliot,austen-persuasion
this explains it,austen-persuasion
but i beg your pardon i have interrupted you,austen-persuasion
those things are too common,austen-persuasion
to do the best for himself passed as a duty,austen-persuasion
she was a fine woman had had a decent education was brought forward by some cousins thrown by chance into mr elliot s company and fell in love with him and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side with respect to her birth,austen-persuasion
it would not be fair and yet you ought to have proof for what is all this but assertion and you shall have proof,austen-persuasion
but for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for mary stay i am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet,austen-persuasion
but he was careless and immethodical like other men about those things and when i came to examine his papers i found it with others still more trivial from different people scattered here and there while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed,austen-persuasion
dear smith i have received yours,austen-persuasion
they are gone back to kellynch and almost made me swear to visit them this summer but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyor to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer,austen-persuasion
i am sick of it,austen-persuasion
the language i know is highly disrespectful,austen-persuasion
anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father,austen-persuasion
i can explain this too cried mrs smith smiling,austen-persuasion
he is no hypocrite now,austen-persuasion
you are acquainted with him,austen-persuasion
she in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it all to her nurse and the nurse knowing my acquaintance with you very naturally brings it all to me,austen-persuasion
mr elliot s having any views on me will not in the least account for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father,austen-persuasion
facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in another can hardly have much truth left,austen-persuasion
so says my historian at least,austen-persuasion
at lyme,austen-persuasion
if there is anything in my story which you know to be either false or improbable stop me,austen-persuasion
upon all points of blood and connexion he is a completely altered man,austen-persuasion
this was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assist in every way that he could,austen-persuasion
yes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with what i have known or could imagine,austen-persuasion
i should like to know his present opinion as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not,austen-persuasion
a scheme worthy of mrs wallis s understanding by all accounts but my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it,austen-persuasion
it will be more painful to me in some respects to be in company with him but i shall know better what to do,austen-persuasion
she learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by mr elliot s marriage they had been as before always together and mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune,austen-persuasion
they had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship of their friends and to prove that mr elliot s had better not be tried but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs was fully known,austen-persuasion
anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend s usual state of mind,austen-persuasion
she had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law,austen-persuasion
after listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not but express some surprise at mrs smith s having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation,austen-persuasion
he was very unkind to his first wife,austen-persuasion
it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady russell,austen-persuasion
in one point her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliot,austen-persuasion
in every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward she saw more to distrust and to apprehend,austen-persuasion
could the knowledge have been extended through her family,austen-persuasion
indeed i do say it,austen-persuasion
cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman s hints,austen-persuasion
quite delightful,austen-persuasion
i lay no embargo on any body s words,austen-persuasion
well my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about him,austen-persuasion
it was impossible but that mrs clay must hate the sight of mr elliot and yet she could assume a most obliging placid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would have done otherwise,austen-persuasion
it was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retrace as quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along,austen-persuasion
he was invited again to camden place the very evening of his return but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certain,austen-persuasion
she saw mrs clay fairly off therefore before she began to talk of spending the morning in rivers street,austen-persuasion
lady russell quite bores one with her new publications,austen-persuasion
my best love of course,austen-persuasion
morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life who make themselves up so little,austen-persuasion
after the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heard and mr and mrs charles musgrove were ushered into the room,austen-persuasion
he gave her a very plain intelligible account of the whole a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding,austen-persuasion
they had arrived late the night before,austen-persuasion
in the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom surrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealous than the other and to two of the three at least charles hayter might get a special recommendation,austen-persuasion
oh,austen-persuasion
it is very fit they should have daughters shares and i am sure he has always been a very kind liberal father to me,austen-persuasion
it is a very fair match as times go and i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off now,austen-persuasion
i hope you think louisa perfectly recovered now,austen-persuasion
to be sure he is,austen-persuasion
i got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did before,austen-persuasion
mary was in excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the change and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother in law s carriage with four horses and with her own complete independence of camden place that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house as they were detailed to her,austen-persuasion
these were her internal persuasions old fashioned notions country hospitality we do not profess to give dinners few people in bath do lady alicia never does did not even ask her own sister s family though they were here a month and i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgrove put her quite out of her way,austen-persuasion
it shall be a regular party small but most elegant,austen-persuasion
they all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutes but anne convinced herself that a day s delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence and hastened forward to the white hart to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn with an eagerness of good will which many associations contributed to form,austen-persuasion
a morning of thorough confusion was to be expected,austen-persuasion
their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings she had derived from it a delightful conviction but she feared from his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which had hastened him away from the concert room still governed,austen-persuasion
anne cried mary still at her window there is mrs clay i am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her,austen-persuasion
good heavens,austen-persuasion
as she spoke she felt that captain wentworth was looking at her the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret that she had said so much simple as it was,austen-persuasion
you will be too late if you do not make haste,austen-persuasion
to pacify mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment anne did move quietly to the window,austen-persuasion
i have been to the theatre and secured a box for to morrow night,austen-persuasion
anne will not be sorry to join us i am sure,austen-persuasion
how can you think of such a thing,austen-persuasion
phoo,austen-persuasion
you may do as you like but i shall go to the play,austen-persuasion
there was no promise,austen-persuasion
nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately,austen-persuasion
i am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising sun,austen-persuasion
mrs musgrove interposed,austen-persuasion
if it depended only on my inclination ma am the party at home excepting on mary s account would not be the smallest impediment,austen-persuasion
captain wentworth left his seat and walked to the fire place probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards and taking a station with less bare faced design by anne,austen-persuasion
i am no card player,austen-persuasion
eight years and a half is a period,austen-persuasion
alarming sounds were heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown open for sir walter and miss elliot whose entrance seemed to give a general chill,austen-persuasion
captain wentworth was acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than before,austen-persuasion
to morrow evening to meet a few friends no formal party,austen-persuasion
the card was pointedly given and sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappeared,austen-persuasion
he held the card in his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering it,austen-persuasion
anne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt and turned away that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her,austen-persuasion
they were reckoning him as certain but with her it was a gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together,austen-persuasion
oh,austen-persuasion
he turned back and walked with me to the pump yard,austen-persuasion
one day only had passed since anne s conversation with mrs smith but a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched by mr elliot s conduct except by its effects in one quarter that it became a matter of course the next morning still to defer her explanatory visit in rivers street,austen-persuasion
the party before her were mrs musgrove talking to mrs croft and captain harville to captain wentworth and she immediately heard that mary and henrietta too impatient to wait had gone out the moment it had cleared but would be back again soon and that the strictest injunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her there till they returned,austen-persuasion
we will write the letter we were talking of harville now if you will give me materials,austen-persuasion
anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self occupied to hear,austen-persuasion
i always think that no mutual,austen-persuasion
yes dear ma am said mrs croft or an uncertain engagement an engagement which may be long,austen-persuasion
captain harville who had in truth been hearing none of it now left his seat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch him though it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood,austen-persuasion
look here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displaying a small miniature painting do you know who that is,austen-persuasion
i little thought then but no matter,austen-persuasion
i hope i can allow for him,austen-persuasion
no replied anne in a low feeling voice,austen-persuasion
captain harville smiled as much as to say do you claim that for your sex,austen-persuasion
we live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon us,austen-persuasion
the peace turned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with us in our little family circle ever since,austen-persuasion
i believe the reverse,austen-persuasion
you have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle with,austen-persuasion
we shall never agree upon this question captain harville was beginning to say when a slight noise called their attention to captain wentworth s hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room,austen-persuasion
i shall have done in five minutes,austen-persuasion
well miss elliot lowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agree i suppose upon this point,austen-persuasion
but perhaps you will say these were all written by men,austen-persuasion
i will not allow books to prove anything,austen-persuasion
we each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sex and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstances perhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence or in some respect saying what should not be said,austen-persuasion
i speak you know only of such men as have hearts,austen-persuasion
i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman,austen-persuasion
she could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heart was too full her breath too much oppressed,austen-persuasion
mrs croft was taking leave,austen-persuasion
captain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste and either could not or would not answer fully,austen-persuasion
anne knew not how to understand it,austen-persuasion
he begged their pardon but he had forgotten his gloves and instantly crossing the room to the writing table he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper placed it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time and hastily collecting his gloves was again out of the room almost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in it the work of an instant,austen-persuasion
anything was possible anything might be defied rather than suspense,austen-persuasion
i am half agony half hope,austen-persuasion
unjust i may have been weak and resentful i have been but never inconstant,austen-persuasion
i had not waited even these ten days could i have read your feelings as i think you must have penetrated mine,austen-persuasion
you do us justice indeed,austen-persuasion
such a letter was not to be soon recovered from,austen-persuasion
the absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle but after a while she could do no more,austen-persuasion
by all means my dear cried mrs musgrove go home directly and take care of yourself that you may be fit for the evening,austen-persuasion
worse than all,austen-persuasion
pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening,austen-persuasion
do you think so,austen-persuasion
to be sure i will if you wish it,austen-persuasion
it could not be very lasting however,austen-persuasion
but she could not be long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith s to be of use to her and she set off with him with no feeling but gratitude apparent,austen-persuasion
he walked by her side,austen-persuasion
are you going as high as belmont,austen-persuasion
by his description a good deal like the second size double barrel of mine which you shot with one day round winthrop,austen-persuasion
there they returned again into the past more exquisitely happy perhaps in their re union than when it had been first projected more tender more tried more fixed in a knowledge of each other s character truth and attachment more equal to act more justified in acting,austen-persuasion
that had begun to operate in the very hour of first meeting her in bath that had returned after a short suspension to ruin the concert and that had influenced him in everything he had said and done or omitted to say and do in the last four and twenty hours,austen-persuasion
he never even believed himself to see her equal,austen-persuasion
the passing admiration of mr elliot had at least roused him and the scenes on the cobb and at captain harville s had fixed her superiority,austen-persuasion
he had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of louisa s accident no sooner begun to feel himself alive again than he had begun to feel himself though alive not at liberty,austen-persuasion
i was hers in honour if she wished it,austen-persuasion
he found too late in short that he had entangled himself and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for louisa at all he must regard himself as bound to her if her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposed,austen-persuasion
i deserved none,austen-persuasion
he had remained in shropshire lamenting the blindness of his own pride and the blunders of his own calculations till at once released from louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with benwick,austen-persuasion
and to arrive with some degree of hope,austen-persuasion
that evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments,austen-persuasion
was it not enough to make the fool of me which i appeared,austen-persuasion
if i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of risk,austen-persuasion
i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmed buried lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting under year after year,austen-persuasion
i should have thought said anne that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this,austen-persuasion
at last anne was at home again and happier than any one in that house could have conceived,austen-persuasion
glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her,austen-persuasion
with the musgroves there was the happy chat of perfect ease with captain harville the kind hearted intercourse of brother and sister with lady russell attempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut short with admiral and mrs croft everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest which the same consciousness sought to conceal and with captain wentworth some moments of communications continually occurring and always the hope of more and always the knowledge of his being there,austen-persuasion
i am not saying that she did not err in her advice,austen-persuasion
not yet,austen-persuasion
tell me if when i returned to england in the year eight with a few thousand pounds and was posted into the laconia if i had then written to you would you have answered my letter,austen-persuasion
he cried you would,austen-persuasion
six years of separation and suffering might have been spared,austen-persuasion
i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune,austen-persuasion
this may be bad morality to conclude with but i believe it to be truth and if such parties succeed how should a captain wentworth and an anne elliot with the advantage of maturity of mind consciousness of right and one independent fortune between them fail of bearing down every opposition,austen-persuasion
sir walter indeed though he had no affection for anne and no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasion was very far from thinking it a bad match for her,austen-persuasion
she must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each that because captain wentworth s manners had not suited her own ideas she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity and that because mr elliot s manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness their general politeness and suavity she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well regulated mind,austen-persuasion
of all the family mary was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance,austen-persuasion
she had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdraw and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him,austen-persuasion
mrs clay s affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificed for the young man s sake the possibility of scheming longer for sir walter,austen-persuasion
there she felt her own inferiority very keenly,austen-persuasion
while he was not obliged to say that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour and as for mrs smith she had claims of various kinds to recommend her quickly and permanently,austen-persuasion
her spring of felicity was in the glow of her spirits as her friend anne s was in the warmth of her heart,austen-persuasion
sense and sensibility by jane austen 1811,austen-sense
but her death which happened ten years before his own produced a great alteration in his home for to supply her loss he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew mr henry dashwood the legal inheritor of the norland estate and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it,austen-sense
the son a steady respectable young man was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother which had been large and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age,austen-sense
he was neither so unjust nor so ungrateful as to leave his estate from his nephew but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest,austen-sense
but the fortune which had been so tardy in coming was his only one twelvemonth,austen-sense
he was not an ill disposed young man unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill disposed but he was in general well respected for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties,austen-sense
the prospect of four thousand a year in addition to his present income besides the remaining half of his own mother s fortune warmed his heart and made him feel capable of generosity yes he would give them three thousand pounds it would be liberal and handsome,austen-sense
no sooner was his father s funeral over than mrs john dashwood without sending any notice of her intention to her mother in law arrived with her child and their attendants,austen-sense
she had an excellent heart her disposition was affectionate and her feelings were strong but she knew how to govern them it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught,austen-sense
elinor saw with concern the excess of her sister s sensibility but by mrs dashwood it was valued and cherished,austen-sense
she could consult with her brother could receive her sister in law on her arrival and treat her with proper attention and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion and encourage her to similar forbearance,austen-sense
he really pressed them with some earnestness to consider norland as their home and as no plan appeared so eligible to mrs dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood his invitation was accepted,austen-sense
to take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree,austen-sense
it was my father s last request to me replied her husband that i should assist his widow and daughters,austen-sense
he could hardly suppose i should neglect them,austen-sense
consider she added that when the money is once parted with it never can return,austen-sense
if he should have a numerous family for instance it would be a very convenient addition,austen-sense
what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters even if really his sisters,austen-sense
there is no knowing what they may expect said the lady but we are not to think of their expectations the question is what you can afford to do,austen-sense
if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they do not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds,austen-sense
but then if mrs dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in,austen-sense
you are not aware of what you are doing,austen-sense
it has given me such an abhorrence of annuities that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world,austen-sense
they think themselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raises no gratitude at all,austen-sense
it will certainly be much the best way,austen-sense
i ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did,austen-sense
only conceive how comfortable they will be,austen-sense
my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say,austen-sense
but however one thing must be considered,austen-sense
and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here,austen-sense
and i must say this that you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention to his wishes for we very well know that if he could he would have left almost everything in the world to them,austen-sense
but she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income which her mother would have approved,austen-sense
the contempt which she had very early in their acquaintance felt for her daughter in law was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character which half a year s residence in her family afforded and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility according to the opinions of mrs dashwood to her daughters continuance at norland,austen-sense
it was contrary to every doctrine of her s that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition and that elinor s merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her was to her comprehension impossible,austen-sense
but he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister who longed to see him distinguished as they hardly knew what,austen-sense
all his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life,austen-sense
she was first called to observe and approve him farther by a reflection which elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister,austen-sense
i think you will like him said elinor when you know more of him,austen-sense
i have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love,austen-sense
in a few months my dear marianne,austen-sense
my love it will be scarcely a separation,austen-sense
perhaps said marianne i may consider it with some surprise,austen-sense
music seems scarcely to attract him and though he admires elinor s drawings very much it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth,austen-sense
he must enter into all my feelings the same books the same music must charm us both,austen-sense
i could hardly keep my seat,austen-sense
nay mamma if he is not to be animated by cowper but we must allow for difference of taste,austen-sense
he must have all edward s virtues and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm,austen-sense
chapter 4,austen-sense
had he ever been in the way of learning i think he would have drawn very well,austen-sense
indeed i think i may say that you cannot for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial and if that were your opinion i am sure you could never be civil to him,austen-sense
i have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind his inclinations and tastes as you have but i have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense,austen-sense
of his sense and his goodness continued elinor no one can i think be in doubt who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation,austen-sense
i have seen a great deal of him have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste and upon the whole i venture to pronounce that his mind is well informed enjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and correct and his taste delicate and pure,austen-sense
i shall very soon think him handsome elinor if i do not now,austen-sense
she knew that what marianne and her mother conjectured one moment they believed the next that with them to wish was to hope and to hope was to expect,austen-sense
like him,austen-sense
use those words again and i will leave the room this moment,austen-sense
i am by no means assured of his regard for me,austen-sense
what his mother really is we cannot know but from fanny s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions we have never been disposed to think her amiable and i am very much mistaken if edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank,austen-sense
but two advantages will proceed from this delay,austen-sense
she could not consider her partiality for edward in so prosperous a state as marianne had believed it,austen-sense
she knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement,austen-sense
she took the first opportunity of affronting her mother in law on the occasion talking to her so expressively of her brother s great expectations of mrs ferrars s resolution that both her sons should marry well and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to draw him in that mrs dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious nor endeavor to be calm,austen-sense
he understood that she was in need of a dwelling and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary if the situation pleased her,austen-sense
the situation of barton in a county so far distant from sussex as devonshire which but a few hours before would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place was now its first recommendation,austen-sense
the house too as described by sir john was on so simple a scale and the rent so uncommonly moderate as to leave her no right of objection on either point and therefore though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy though it was a removal from the vicinity of norland beyond her wishes she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence,austen-sense
she had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into devonshire edward turned hastily towards her on hearing this and in a voice of surprise and concern which required no explanation to her repeated devonshire,austen-sense
it was within four miles northward of exeter,austen-sense
to separate edward and elinor was as far from being her object as ever and she wished to show mrs john dashwood by this pointed invitation to her brother how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match,austen-sense
mrs dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth it was ready furnished and she might have immediate possession,austen-sense
her eagerness to be gone from norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter in law in the prospect of her removal a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure,austen-sense
in a very few weeks from the day which brought sir john middleton s first letter to norland every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable mrs dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey,austen-sense
chapter 6,austen-sense
a small green court was the whole of its demesne in front and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it,austen-sense
it had not been built many years and was in good repair,austen-sense
high hills rose immediately behind and at no great distance on each side some of which were open downs the others cultivated and woody,austen-sense
as for the house itself to be sure said she it is too small for our family but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present as it is too late in the year for improvements,austen-sense
i shall see how much i am before hand with the world in the spring and we will plan our improvements accordingly,austen-sense
he had formerly visited at stanhill but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him,austen-sense
he insisted moreover on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day,austen-sense
but they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration by shewing that though perfectly well bred she was reserved cold and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common place inquiry or remark,austen-sense
chapter 7,austen-sense
they were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood,austen-sense
continual engagements at home and abroad however supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education supported the good spirits of sir john and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife,austen-sense
the miss dashwoods were young pretty and unaffected,austen-sense
they would see he said only one gentleman there besides himself a particular friend who was staying at the park but who was neither very young nor very gay,austen-sense
mrs jennings lady middleton s mother was a good humoured merry fat elderly woman who talked a great deal seemed very happy and rather vulgar,austen-sense
his appearance however was not unpleasing in spite of his being in the opinion of marianne and margaret an absolute old bachelor for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty but though his face was not handsome his countenance was sensible and his address was particularly gentlemanlike,austen-sense
marianne s performance was highly applauded,austen-sense
his pleasure in music though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment,austen-sense
in the promotion of this object she was zealously active as far as her ability reached and missed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance,austen-sense
it would be an excellent match for he was rich and she was handsome,austen-sense
mrs dashwood who could not think a man five years younger than herself so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter ventured to clear mrs jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age,austen-sense
infirmity,austen-sense
my dearest child said her mother laughing at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty,austen-sense
perhaps said elinor thirty five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together,austen-sense
in my eyes it would be no marriage at all but that would be nothing,austen-sense
had he been only in a violent fever you would not have despised him half so much,austen-sense
nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay,austen-sense
on the contrary if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation when i talked of his coming to barton,austen-sense
what can be the meaning of it,austen-sense
twice did i leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room,austen-sense
chapter 9,austen-sense
there were but few who could be so classed and it was not all of them that were attainable,austen-sense
the weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book in spite of marianne s declaration that the day would be lastingly fair and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills and the two girls set off together,austen-sense
they set off,austen-sense
the gentleman offered his services and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary took her up in his arms without farther delay and carried her down the hill,austen-sense
but this he declined as he was dirty and wet,austen-sense
but she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others and with an energy which always adorned her praise,austen-sense
sir john called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors and marianne s accident being related to him he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of willoughby at allenham,austen-sense
know him,austen-sense
a very decent shot and there is not a bolder rider in england,austen-sense
sir john was rather puzzled,austen-sense
but who is he,austen-sense
miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself,austen-sense
i am glad to find however from what you say that he is a respectable young man and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible,austen-sense
yes and he was up again at eight to ride to covert,austen-sense
that is an expression sir john said marianne warmly which i particularly dislike,austen-sense
poor brandon,austen-sense
of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced,austen-sense
from willoughby their expression was at first held back by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created,austen-sense
encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions she proceeded to question him on the subject of books her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a delight that any young man of five and twenty must have been insensible indeed not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works however disregarded before,austen-sense
you have already ascertained mr willoughby s opinion in almost every matter of importance,austen-sense
,austen-sense
i have been too much at my ease too happy too frank,austen-sense
willoughby on his side gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance which an evident wish of improving it could offer,austen-sense
he was exactly formed to engage marianne s heart for with all this he joined not only a captivating person but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own and which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else,austen-sense
marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection had been rash and unjustifiable,austen-sense
elinor was obliged though unwillingly to believe that the sentiments which mrs jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction were now actually excited by her sister and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of mr willoughby an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of colonel brandon,austen-sense
sir john had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man and she regarded him with respect and compassion,austen-sense
he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park and i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him,austen-sense
in defence of your protege you can even be saucy,austen-sense
that is to say cried marianne contemptuously he has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot and the mosquitoes are troublesome,austen-sense
i do not dislike him,austen-sense
i can only pronounce him to be a sensible man well bred well informed of gentle address and i believe possessing an amiable heart,austen-sense
i have three unanswerable reasons for disliking colonel brandon he threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle and i cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare,austen-sense
yet such was the case,austen-sense
she only wished that it were less openly shewn and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self command to marianne,austen-sense
every thing he said was clever,austen-sense
to her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind,austen-sense
they afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind nor that could teach her to think of norland with less regret than ever,austen-sense
towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired,austen-sense
her admiration and regard even her sisterly regard was all his own but he was a lover his attentions were wholly marianne s and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing,austen-sense
no replied elinor her opinions are all romantic,austen-sense
this will probably be the case he replied and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions,austen-sense
does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment,austen-sense
this said he cannot hold but a change a total change of sentiments no no do not desire it for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common and too dangerous,austen-sense
elinor attempted no more,austen-sense
marianne told her with the greatest delight that willoughby had given her a horse one that he had bred himself on his estate in somersetshire and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman,austen-sense
most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair and for some time she refused to submit to them,austen-sense
i have not known him long indeed but i am much better acquainted with him than i am with any other creature in the world except yourself and mama,austen-sense
elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more,austen-sense
the reasons for this alteration were at the same time related and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible,austen-sense
from that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she or any of their friends should be left by tempers so frank to discover it by accident,austen-sense
i am sure she will be married to mr willoughby very soon,austen-sense
it may be only the hair of some great uncle of his,austen-sense
margaret s sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister,austen-sense
marianne felt for her most sincerely but she did more harm than good to the cause by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to margaret,austen-sense
pray miss margaret let us know all about it said mrs jennings,austen-sense
he is the curate of the parish i dare say,austen-sense
most grateful did elinor feel to lady middleton for observing at this moment that it rained very hard though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her than from her ladyship s great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother,austen-sense
the grounds were declared to be highly beautiful and sir john who was particularly warm in their praise might be allowed to be a tolerable judge for he had formed parties to visit them at least twice every summer for the last ten years,austen-sense
she was prepared to be wet through fatigued and frightened but the event was still more unfortunate for they did not go at all,austen-sense
among the rest there was one for colonel brandon he took it looked at the direction changed colour and immediately left the room,austen-sense
it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly,austen-sense
i hope it is not to say that your sister is worse,austen-sense
my dear madam said lady middleton recollect what you are saying,austen-sense
and i hope she is well,austen-sense
i am particularly sorry ma am said he addressing lady middleton that i should receive this letter today for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town,austen-sense
what a blow upon them all was this,austen-sense
i wish it could be so easily settled,austen-sense
,austen-sense
i have no doubt of it replied marianne,austen-sense
well then when will you come back again,austen-sense
he must and shall come back cried sir john,austen-sense
colonel brandon s horses were announced,austen-sense
i shall then go post,austen-sense
is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter miss dashwood,austen-sense
he wished her a good morning and attended by sir john left the room,austen-sense
yes it is about miss williams i am sure,austen-sense
i am sure you must have heard of her before,austen-sense
oh yes and as like him as she can stare,austen-sense
they both seemed delighted with their drive but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes while the others went on the downs,austen-sense
i know where you spent the morning,austen-sense
it is a very large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you will have new furnished it for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago,austen-sense
marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it,austen-sense
mr willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house and as he went in an open carriage it was impossible to have any other companion,austen-sense
if the impertinent remarks of mrs jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct we are all offending every moment of our lives,austen-sense
she blushed at this hint but it was even visibly gratifying to her and after a ten minutes interval of earnest thought she came to her sister again and said with great good humour perhaps elinor it was rather ill judged in me to go to allenham but mr willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place and it is a charming house i assure you there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs of a nice comfortable size for constant use and with modern furniture it would be delightful,austen-sense
chapter 14,austen-sense
poor man,austen-sense
i would give anything to know the truth of it,austen-sense
i wonder what it can be,austen-sense
her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture and all seeming equally probable as they arose,austen-sense
she could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power for though willoughby was independent there was no reason to believe him rich,austen-sense
the cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home many more of his hours were spent there than at allenham and if no general engagement collected them at the park the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of marianne and by his favourite pointer at her feet,austen-sense
that i will never consent to,austen-sense
thank you willoughby,austen-sense
to me it is faultless,austen-sense
i flatter myself replied elinor that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this,austen-sense
how little did i then think that the very first news i should hear from mrs smith when i next came into the country would be that barton cottage was taken and i felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness i should experience from it can account for,austen-sense
and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford,austen-sense
tell me that not only your house will remain the same but that i shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me,austen-sense
he engaged to be with them by four o clock,austen-sense
they were no sooner in the passage than marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction with her handkerchief at her eyes and without noticing them ran up stairs,austen-sense
i hope not he replied trying to look cheerful and with a forced smile presently added it is i who may rather expect to be ill for i am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment,austen-sense
to london and are you going this morning,austen-sense
my visits to mrs smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth,austen-sense
mrs dashwood looked at elinor with surprise,austen-sense
my engagements at present replied willoughby confusedly are of such a nature that i dare not flatter myself,austen-sense
he then hastily took leave of them all and left the room,austen-sense
willoughby s behaviour in taking leave of them his embarrassment and affectation of cheerfulness and above all his unwillingness to accept her mother s invitation a backwardness so unlike a lover so unlike himself greatly disturbed her,austen-sense
it is all very strange,austen-sense
he did not speak he did not behave like himself,austen-sense
,austen-sense
yes,austen-sense
you will tell me i know that this may or may not have happened but i will listen to no cavil unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this,austen-sense
you had rather take evil upon credit than good,austen-sense
is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love and no reason in the world to think ill of,austen-sense
there is great truth however in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body,austen-sense
but you really do admit the justice of what i have said in his defence i am happy and he is acquitted,austen-sense
my dear child do you accuse willoughby and marianne of concealment,austen-sense
i have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly,austen-sense
how could such a thought occur to you,austen-sense
has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time,austen-sense
you must remember my dear mother that i have never considered this matter as certain,austen-sense
ungracious girl,austen-sense
but why,austen-sense
i love willoughby sincerely love him and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me,austen-sense
in such a case a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour i think as well as more consistent with his general character but i will not raise objections against any one s conduct on so illiberal a foundation as a difference in judgment from myself or a deviation from what i may think right and consistent,austen-sense
it is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance and even secrecy as far as it can be observed may now be very advisable,austen-sense
this violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening,austen-sense
she would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than when she lay down in it,austen-sense
when breakfast was over she walked out by herself and wandered about the village of allenham indulging the recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning,austen-sense
she read nothing but what they had been used to read together,austen-sense
remember elinor said she how very often sir john fetches our letters himself from the post and carries them to it,austen-sense
from you her mother and so kind so indulgent a mother the question could not give offence,austen-sense
at any rate it would be most ungenerous,austen-sense
it was several days before willoughby s name was mentioned before marianne by any of her family sir john and mrs jennings indeed were not so nice their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour but one evening mrs dashwood accidentally taking up a volume of shakespeare exclaimed,austen-sense
no nor many weeks,austen-sense
but at length she was secured by the exertions of elinor who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion,austen-sense
it is he it is indeed i know it is,austen-sense
he has he has cried marianne i am sure he has,austen-sense
marianne looked again her heart sunk within her and abruptly turning round she was hurrying back when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her a third almost as well known as willoughby s joined them in begging her to stop and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome edward ferrars,austen-sense
on edward s side more particularly there was a deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion,austen-sense
no he had been in devonshire a fortnight,austen-sense
said elinor,austen-sense
the woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves,austen-sense
they are seen only as a nuisance swept hastily off and driven as much as possible from the sight,austen-sense
look up to it and be tranquil if you can,austen-sense
and there beneath that farthest hill which rises with such grandeur is our cottage,austen-sense
said marianne to herself as she walked on,austen-sense
how can you be so unjust,austen-sense
his coldness and reserve mortified her severely she was vexed and half angry but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure and treated him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection,austen-sense
they had begun to fail him before he entered the house and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of mrs dashwood,austen-sense
what are mrs ferrars s views for you at present edward,austen-sense
for famous you must be to satisfy all your family and with no inclination for expense no affection for strangers no profession and no assurance you may find it a difficult matter,austen-sense
you have no ambition i well know,austen-sense
strange that it would,austen-sense
said marianne money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it,austen-sense
come what is your competence,austen-sense
i guessed how it would end,austen-sense
elinor smiled again to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at combe magna,austen-sense
i wish said margaret striking out a novel thought that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece,austen-sense
cried margaret how happy i should be,austen-sense
what magnificent orders would travel from this family to london said edward in such an event,austen-sense
forgive me if i am very saucy,austen-sense
no edward i should have something else to do with it,austen-sense
marianne is as steadfast as ever you see said elinor she is not at all altered,austen-sense
replied he with a sigh,austen-sense
sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves and very frequently by what other people say of them without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge,austen-sense
my doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding,austen-sense
quite the contrary replied elinor looking expressively at marianne,austen-sense
she knows her own worth too well for false shame replied edward,austen-sense
am i reserved marianne,austen-sense
what can you suppose,austen-sense
chapter 18,austen-sense
but before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open and turning round was astonished to see edward himself come out,austen-sense
i shall call hills steep which ought to be bold surfaces strange and uncouth which ought to be irregular and rugged and distant objects out of sight which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere,austen-sense
i am afraid it is but too true said marianne but why should you boast of it,austen-sense
every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was,austen-sense
i do not like crooked twisted blasted trees,austen-sense
marianne looked with amazement at edward with compassion at her sister,austen-sense
is that fanny s hair,austen-sense
the setting always casts a different shade on it you know,austen-sense
he was particularly grave the whole morning,austen-sense
sir john never came to the dashwoods without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day or to drink tea with them that evening,austen-sense
and that will tempt you miss marianne,austen-sense
who,austen-sense
and who is willoughby,austen-sense
shall i tell you my guess,austen-sense
marianne was surprised and confused yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner and after a moment s silence said,austen-sense
edward remained a week at the cottage he was earnestly pressed by mrs dashwood to stay longer but as if he were bent only on self mortification he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height,austen-sense
he valued their kindness beyond any thing and his greatest happiness was in being with them,austen-sense
the shortness of his visit the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them originated in the same fettered inclination the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother,austen-sense
some inconvenience to your friends indeed might result from it you would not be able to give them so much of your time,austen-sense
we never could agree in our choice of a profession,austen-sense
the law was allowed to be genteel enough many young men who had chambers in the temple made a very good appearance in the first circles and drove about town in very knowing gigs,austen-sense
they will be brought up said he in a serious accent to be as unlike myself as is possible,austen-sense
know your own happiness,austen-sense
this desponding turn of mind though it could not be communicated to mrs dashwood gave additional pain to them all in the parting which shortly took place and left an uncomfortable impression on elinor s feelings especially which required some trouble and time to subdue,austen-sense
the business of self command she settled very easily with strong affections it was impossible with calm ones it could have no merit,austen-sense
from a reverie of this kind as she sat at her drawing table she was roused one morning soon after edward s leaving them by the arrival of company,austen-sense
well said he we have brought you some strangers,austen-sense
it is only the palmers,austen-sense
has she run away because we are come,austen-sense
how does mrs dashwood do,austen-sense
i have brought my other son and daughter to see you,austen-sense
mrs palmer was several years younger than lady middleton and totally unlike her in every respect,austen-sense
he entered the room with a look of self consequence slightly bowed to the ladies without speaking a word and after briefly surveying them and their apartments took up a newspaper from the table and continued to read it as long as he staid,austen-sense
only think mamma how it is improved since i was here last,austen-sense
should not you mr,austen-sense
this was quite a new idea to mrs dashwood she had never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one and could not help looking with surprise at them both,austen-sense
mrs palmer laughed and said it would not do her any harm,austen-sense
now palmer you shall see a monstrous pretty girl,austen-sense
she got up to examine them,austen-sense
do but look mama how sweet,austen-sense
said his wife laughing,austen-sense
but they had no curiosity to see how mr and mrs palmer ate their dinner and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way,austen-sense
why should they ask us,austen-sense
we must look for the change elsewhere,austen-sense
said she seating herself between elinor and marianne for it is so bad a day i was afraid you might not come which would be a shocking thing as we go away again tomorrow,austen-sense
i am so sorry we cannot stay longer however we shall meet again in town very soon i hope,austen-sense
you must come indeed,austen-sense
how horrid all this is,austen-sense
what the devil does sir john mean by not having a billiard room in his house,austen-sense
marianne looked very grave and said nothing,austen-sense
ah well,austen-sense
is it very ugly,austen-sense
did not i tell you sir john when you spoke to me about it before that it could not be done,austen-sense
do you know that you are quite rude,austen-sense
it was impossible for any one to be more thoroughly good natured or more determined to be happy than mrs palmer,austen-sense
elinor was not inclined after a little observation to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill natured or ill bred as he wished to appear,austen-sense
will you come and spend some time at cleveland this christmas,austen-sense
there now said his lady you see mr palmer expects you so you cannot refuse to come,austen-sense
you cannot think what a sweet place cleveland is and we are so gay now for mr palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election and so many people came to dine with us that i never saw before it is quite charming,austen-sense
how charming it will be said charlotte when he is in parliament won t it,austen-sense
palmer,austen-sense
there now you see how droll he is,austen-sense
well i am so glad you do,austen-sense
oh dear yes i know him extremely well replied mrs palmer not that i ever spoke to him indeed but i have seen him for ever in town,austen-sense
i know why you inquire about him very well your sister is to marry him,austen-sense
my dear mrs,austen-sense
surely you must be mistaken,austen-sense
for of course you must know as you have been in devonshire so lately,austen-sense
mr brandon was very well i hope,austen-sense
so do i he is such a charming man that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull,austen-sense
yes extremely well that is i do not believe many people are acquainted with him because combe magna is so far off but they all think him extremely agreeable i assure you,austen-sense
i am so glad we are got acquainted at last continued charlotte and now i hope we shall always be great friends,austen-sense
i hope you will be a great deal at combe magna,austen-sense
sir john and lady middleton wished it very much,austen-sense
he had not seen me then above twice for it was before i left school,austen-sense
but this did not last long elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head had hardly done wondering at charlotte s being so happy without a cause at mr palmer s acting so simply with good abilities and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife before sir john s and mrs jennings s active zeal in the cause of society procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe,austen-sense
the young ladies arrived their appearance was by no means ungenteel or unfashionable,austen-sense
sir john wanted the whole family to walk to the park directly and look at his guests,austen-sense
the children are all hanging about her already as if she was an old acquaintance,austen-sense
why they are your cousins you know after a fashion,austen-sense
with her children they were in continual raptures extolling their beauty courting their notice and humouring their whims and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing if she happened to be doing any thing or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight,austen-sense
john is in such spirits today,austen-sense
the mother s consternation was excessive but it could not surpass the alarm of the miss steeles and every thing was done by all three in so critical an emergency which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer,austen-sense
said miss steele as soon as they were gone,austen-sense
said lucy steele,austen-sense
she merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly,austen-sense
i confess replied elinor that while i am at barton park i never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence,austen-sense
added miss steele,austen-sense
but why should you think said lucy looking ashamed of her sister that there are not as many genteel young men in devonshire as sussex,austen-sense
but i can t bear to see them dirty and nasty,austen-sense
dear,austen-sense
this specimen of the miss steeles was enough,austen-sense
twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure said she and i hear he is quite a beau and prodigious handsome,austen-sense
but sir john did not sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name as miss steele had in hearing it,austen-sense
your sister in law s brother miss dashwood,austen-sense
elinor heard all this with attention and surprise,austen-sense
the manner in which miss steele had spoken of edward increased her curiosity for it struck her as being rather ill natured and suggested the suspicion of that lady s knowing or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage but her curiosity was unavailing for no farther notice was taken of mr ferrars s name by miss steele when alluded to or even openly mentioned by sir john,austen-sense
you will think my question an odd one i dare say said lucy to her one day as they were walking together from the park to the cottage but pray are you personally acquainted with your sister in law s mother mrs,austen-sense
then perhaps you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is,austen-sense
i cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious,austen-sense
i am sorry i do not said elinor in great astonishment if it could be of any use to you to know my opinion of her,austen-sense
she looked down as she said this amiably bashful with only one side glance at her companion to observe its effect on her,austen-sense
and she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a sister in law,austen-sense
you may well be surprised continued lucy for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before for i dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family because it was always meant to be a great secret and i am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour,austen-sense
her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words but at length forcing herself to speak and to speak cautiously she said with calmness of manner which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude may i ask if your engagement is of long standing,austen-sense
i did not know said she that you were even acquainted till the other day,austen-sense
did you never hear him talk of mr,austen-sense
i was very unwilling to enter into it as you may imagine without the knowledge and approbation of his mother but i was too young and loved him too well to be so prudent as i ought to have been though you do not know him so well as me miss dashwood you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him,austen-sense
mr edward ferrars the eldest son of mrs ferrars of park street and brother of your sister in law mrs john dashwood is the person i mean you must allow that i am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends,austen-sense
four years you have been engaged said she with a firm voice,austen-sense
it does not do him justice to be sure but yet i think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was drew for i have had it above these three years,austen-sense
you are quite in the right replied elinor calmly,austen-sense
i certainly did not seek your confidence said elinor but you do me no more than justice in imagining that i may be depended on,austen-sense
i have not known you long to be sure personally at least but i have known you and all your family by description a great while and as soon as i saw you i felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance,austen-sense
i only wonder that i am alive after what i have suffered for edward s sake these last four years,austen-sense
continued lucy after wiping her eyes i think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely,austen-sense
what would you do yourself,austen-sense
he was so miserable when he left us at longstaple to go to you that i was afraid you would think him quite ill,austen-sense
she remembered too her own surprise at the time at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends at his total silence with respect even to their names,austen-sense
i heard from him just before i left exeter taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to elinor,austen-sense
yes i have one other comfort in his picture but poor edward has not even that,austen-sense
she was mortified shocked confounded,austen-sense
however small elinor s general dependence on lucy s veracity might be it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description,austen-sense
was his engagement to lucy an engagement of the heart,austen-sense
he certainly loved her,austen-sense
his imprudence had made her miserable for a while but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise,austen-sense
these difficulties indeed with a heart so alienated from lucy might not press very hard upon his patience but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness could be felt as a relief,austen-sense
on the contrary it was a relief to her to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of edward which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself and which was more than she felt equal to support,austen-sense
that lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable it was plain that edward had always spoken highly in her praise not merely from lucy s assertion but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance with a secret so confessedly and evidently important,austen-sense
and as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already been told she did not mistrust her own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure,austen-sense
elinor who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view in such a party as this was likely to be more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well bred direction of lady middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose immediately accepted the invitation margaret with her mother s permission was equally compliant and marianne though always unwilling to join any of their parties was persuaded by her mother who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement to go likewise,austen-sense
they all rose up in preparation for a round game,austen-sense
you are very good i hope it won t hurt your eyes will you ring the bell for some working candles,austen-sense
i shall go to the piano forte i have not touched it since it was tuned,austen-sense
perhaps continued elinor if i should happen to cut out i may be of some use to miss lucy steele in rolling her papers for her and there is so much still to be done to the basket that it must be impossible i think for her labour singly to finish it this evening,austen-sense
you are very kind said lady middleton to elinor and as you really like the work perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber or will you take your chance now,austen-sense
in a firm though cautious tone elinor thus began,austen-sense
how could you suppose so,austen-sense
but i am very glad to find it was only my own fancy and that you really do not blame me,austen-sense
he has only two thousand pounds of his own it would be madness to marry upon that though for my own part i could give up every prospect of more without a sigh,austen-sense
if the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed as between many people and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years engagement your situation would have been pitiable indeed,austen-sense
lucy went on,austen-sense
or have you none but that of waiting for mrs ferrars s death which is a melancholy and shocking extremity is her son determined to submit to this and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth,austen-sense
do you know mr robert ferrars,austen-sense
no sister cried lucy you are mistaken there our favourite beaux are not great coxcombs,austen-sense
a mutual silence took place for some time,austen-sense
i should always be happy replied elinor to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for mr ferrars but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary,austen-sense
at length lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh,austen-sense
you know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you unless it were on the side of your wishes,austen-sense
if you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings your opinion would not be worth having,austen-sense
certainly not,austen-sense
how unlucky that is,austen-sense
elinor was soon called to the card table by the conclusion of the first rubber and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end to which both of them submitted without any reluctance for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before and elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage which sincere affection on her side would have given for self interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary,austen-sense
though mrs jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends she was not without a settled habitation of her own,austen-sense
mrs jennings received the refusal with some surprise and repeated her invitation immediately,austen-sense
we three shall be able to go very well in my chaise and when we are in town if you do not like to go wherever i do well and good you may always go with one of my daughters,austen-sense
so i would advise you two to set off for town when you are tired of barton without saying a word to miss dashwood about it,austen-sense
come miss marianne let us strike hands upon the bargain and if miss dashwood will change her mind by and bye why so much the better,austen-sense
mrs jennings repeated her assurance that mrs dashwood could spare them perfectly well and elinor who now understood her sister and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with willoughby again made no farther direct opposition to the plan and merely referred it to her mother s decision from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit which she could not approve of for marianne and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid,austen-sense
margaret and i shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves,austen-sense
you will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman of whose kindness to you i can have no doubt,austen-sense
what formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward,austen-sense
i have no such scruples and i am sure i could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort,austen-sense
elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother s dependence on the attachment of edward and herself that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed and now on this attack though almost hopeless of success she forced herself to begin her design by saying as calmly as she could i like edward ferrars very much and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether i am ever known to them or not,austen-sense
sir john was delighted for to a man whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone the acquisition of two to the number of inhabitants in london was something,austen-sense
her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive,austen-sense
chapter 26,austen-sense
should the result of her observations be unfavourable she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister should it be otherwise her exertions would be of a different nature she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of marianne,austen-sense
the house was handsome and handsomely fitted up and the young ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment,austen-sense
i am not going to write to my mother replied marianne hastily and as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry,austen-sense
this decided the matter at once,austen-sense
every thing was silent this could not be borne many seconds she opened the door advanced a few steps towards the stairs and after listening half a minute returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming oh elinor it is willoughby indeed it is,austen-sense
is your sister ill,austen-sense
elinor wished very much to ask whether willoughby were then in town but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival and at length by way of saying something she asked if he had been in london ever since she had seen him last,austen-sense
colonel said she with her usual noisy cheerfulness i am monstrous glad to see you sorry i could not come before beg your pardon but i have been forced to look about me a little and settle my matters for it is a long while since i have been at home and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time and then i have had cartwright to settle with lord i have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner,austen-sense
i warrant you she is a fine size by this time,austen-sense
i do not know what you and mr willoughby will do between you about her,austen-sense
ah,austen-sense
come come let s have no secrets among friends,austen-sense
marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks,austen-sense
i forget what it was now but it was something so droll,austen-sense
it was late in the morning before they returned home and no sooner had they entered the house than marianne flew eagerly up stairs and when elinor followed she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance which declared that no willoughby had been there,austen-sense
she replied,austen-sense
how odd indeed,austen-sense
i long to inquire and how will my interference be borne,austen-sense
she sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read but the book was soon thrown aside and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window in hopes of distinguishing the long expected rap,austen-sense
that is true cried marianne in a cheerful voice and walking to the window as she spoke to examine the day,austen-sense
how much they must enjoy it,austen-sense
at any rate said elinor wishing to prevent mrs jennings from seeing her sister s thoughts as clearly as she did i dare say we shall have sir john and lady middleton in town by the end of next week,austen-sense
whatever the truth of it might be and far as elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it yet while she saw marianne in spirits she could not be very uncomfortable herself,austen-sense
i can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff,austen-sense
every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan and excepting a few old city friends whom to lady middleton s regret she had never dropped she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions,austen-sense
about a week after their arrival it became certain that willoughby was also arrived,austen-sense
but marianne seemed hardly to hear her and on mrs jenning s entrance escaped with the precious card,austen-sense
a note was just then brought in and laid on the table,austen-sense
it is indeed for mrs jennings how provoking,austen-sense
you have no confidence in me marianne,austen-sense
we have neither of us any thing to tell you because you do not communicate and i because i conceal nothing,austen-sense
the invitation was accepted but when the hour of appointment drew near necessary as it was in common civility to mrs jennings that they should both attend her on such a visit elinor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go for still she had seen nothing of willoughby and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence,austen-sense
he looked at them slightly without seeming to know who they were and merely nodded to mrs jennings from the other side of the room,austen-sense
replied elinor,austen-sense
she complained of it as they returned to berkeley street,austen-sense
marianne said no more but looked exceedingly hurt,austen-sense
marianne who had seen him from the window and who hated company of any kind left the room before he entered it,austen-sense
elinor was not prepared for such a question and having no answer ready was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient of asking what he meant,austen-sense
by whom can you have heard it mentioned,austen-sense
is it impossible to,austen-sense
these words which conveyed to elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister affected her very much,austen-sense
he listened to her with silent attention and on her ceasing to speak rose directly from his seat and after saying in a voice of emotion to your sister i wish all imaginable happiness to willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her took leave and went away,austen-sense
she sat by the drawing room fire after tea till the moment of lady middleton s arrival without once stirring from her seat or altering her attitude lost in her own thoughts and insensible of her sister s presence and when at last they were told that lady middleton waited for them at the door she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected,austen-sense
she soon caught his eye and he immediately bowed but without attempting to speak to her or to approach marianne though he could not but see her and then continued his discourse with the same lady,austen-sense
why does he not look at me,austen-sense
she sat in an agony of impatience which affected every feature,austen-sense
her face was crimsoned over and she exclaimed in a voice of the greatest emotion good god,austen-sense
during all this time he was evidently struggling for composure,austen-sense
but have you not received my notes,austen-sense
he made no reply his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned but as if on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking he felt the necessity of instant exertion he recovered himself again and after saying yes i had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town which you were so good as to send me turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined his friend,austen-sense
no my dearest marianne you must wait,austen-sense
she instantly begged her sister would entreat lady middleton to take them home as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer,austen-sense
that some kind of engagement had subsisted between willoughby and marianne she could not doubt and that willoughby was weary of it seemed equally clear for however marianne might still feed her own wishes she could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or misapprehension of any kind,austen-sense
her own situation gained in the comparison for while she could esteem edward as much as ever however they might be divided in future her mind might be always supported,austen-sense
marianne may i ask,austen-sense
in such circumstances it was better for both that they should not be long together and the restless state of marianne s mind not only prevented her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place made her wander about the house till breakfast time avoiding the sight of every body,austen-sense
of elinor s distress she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug to see any thing at all and calmly continuing her talk as soon as marianne disappeared she said,austen-sense
elinor though never less disposed to speak than at that moment obliged herself to answer such an attack as this and therefore trying to smile replied and have you really ma am talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister s being engaged to mr willoughby,austen-sense
don t we all know that it must be a match that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met,austen-sense
indeed ma am said elinor very seriously you are mistaken,austen-sense
elinor who knew that such grief shocking as it was to witness it must have its course watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent itself and then turning eagerly to willoughby s letter read as follows,austen-sense
i shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in devonshire without the most grateful pleasure and flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of my actions,austen-sense
with what indignation such a letter as this must be read by miss dashwood may be imagined,austen-sense
mrs jennings with a thoroughly good humoured concern for its cause admitted the excuse most readily and elinor after seeing her safe off returned to marianne whom she found attempting to rise from the bed and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food for it was many days since she had any appetite and many nights since she had really slept and now when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head a weakened stomach and a general nervous faintness,austen-sense
this as every thing else would have been was too much for marianne who could only exclaim in the anguish of her heart oh,austen-sense
i cannot i cannot cried marianne leave me leave me if i distress you leave me hate me forget me,austen-sense
do you call me happy marianne,austen-sense
no no no cried marianne wildly he loves you and only you,austen-sense
you must not talk so marianne,austen-sense
every additional day of unhappy confidence on your side would have made the blow more dreadful,austen-sense
he has broken no faith with me,austen-sense
yet you wrote to him,austen-sense
berkeley street january,austen-sense
for the present adieu,austen-sense
pray call again as soon as possible and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain,austen-sense
you must be very much altered indeed since we parted if that could be the case and you not there,austen-sense
again i demand an explanation of it,austen-sense
tell me what it is explain the grounds on which you acted and i shall be satisfied in being able to satisfy you,austen-sense
that such letters so full of affection and confidence could have been so answered elinor for willoughby s sake would have been unwilling to believe,austen-sense
i know he did,austen-sense
the morning that we parted too,austen-sense
by whom can he have been instigated,austen-sense
elinor would not contend and only replied whoever may have been so detestably your enemy let them be cheated of their malignant triumph my dear sister by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits,austen-sense
elinor elinor they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like may resist insult or return mortification but i cannot,austen-sense
who can require it,austen-sense
cruel cruel nothing can acquit you,austen-sense
willoughby where was your heart when you wrote those words,austen-sense
another pause ensued marianne was greatly agitated and it ended thus,austen-sense
yes why should i stay here,austen-sense
well then another day or two perhaps but i cannot stay here long i cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people,austen-sense
some lavender drops however which she was at length persuaded to take were of use and from that time till mrs jennings returned she continued on the bed quiet and motionless,austen-sense
how is she miss dashwood poor thing,austen-sense
mrs taylor told me of it half an hour ago and she was told it by a particular friend of miss grey herself else i am sure i should not have believed it and i was almost ready to sink as it was,austen-sense
well poor thing,austen-sense
elinor even advised her against it,austen-sense
elinor who did justice to mrs jennings s kindness though its effusions were often distressing and sometimes almost ridiculous made her those acknowledgments and returned her those civilities which her sister could not make or return for herself,austen-sense
as soon however as the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on marianne she could stay no longer,austen-sense
and the dried cherries too,austen-sense
but when there is plenty of money on one side and next to none on the other lord bless you,austen-sense
a smart stylish girl they say but not handsome,austen-sense
no wonder,austen-sense
but that won t do now a days nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age,austen-sense
and who are the ellisons,austen-sense
well by and by we shall have a few friends and that will amuse her a little,austen-sense
i shall persuade her if i can to go early to bed for i am sure she wants rest,austen-sense
and so the letter that came today finished it,austen-sense
lord,austen-sense
their own good nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject the more my feelings will be spared as you my dear madam will easily believe,austen-sense
you saw i did not all dinner time,austen-sense
i must do this justice to mr willoughby he has broken no positive engagement with my sister,austen-sense
elinor for her sister s sake could not press the subject farther and she hoped it was not required of her for willoughby s since though marianne might lose much he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth,austen-sense
lord,austen-sense
delaford is a nice place i can tell you exactly what i call a nice old fashioned place full of comforts and conveniences quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit trees in the country and such a mulberry tree in one corner,austen-sense
tis a nice place,austen-sense
if we can but put willoughby out of her head,austen-sense
but this from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering she at first refused to do,austen-sense
how fond he was of it,austen-sense
mrs jennings though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier was satisfied with the compromise and elinor as she swallowed the chief of it reflected that though its effects on a colicky gout were at present of little importance to her its healing powers on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister,austen-sense
marianne is not well said she,austen-sense
if you know it already as surely you must i may be spared,austen-sense
where did you hear it,austen-sense
my astonishment but it would be impossible to describe what i felt,austen-sense
it may be so but willoughby is capable at least i think he stopped a moment then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself and your sister how did she,austen-sense
he has been very deceitful,austen-sense
you know her disposition and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could,austen-sense
elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt and before breakfast was ready they had gone through the subject again and again and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on elinor s side the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on marianne s as before,austen-sense
no no no it cannot be she cried she cannot feel,austen-sense
she expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself,austen-sense
in one moment her imagination placed before her a letter from willoughby full of tenderness and contrition explanatory of all that had passed satisfactory convincing and instantly followed by willoughby himself rushing eagerly into the room to inforce at her feet by the eloquence of his eyes the assurances of his letter,austen-sense
willoughby filled every page,austen-sense
elinor with a very heavy heart aware of the pain she was going to communicate and perceiving by marianne s letter how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed and entreat her directions for the future while marianne who came into the drawing room on mrs jennings s going away remained fixed at the table where elinor wrote watching the advancement of her pen grieving over her for the hardship of such a task and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother,austen-sense
i thought we had been safe,austen-sense
he will not come in as mrs jennings is from home,austen-sense
my object my wish my sole wish in desiring it i hope i believe it is is to be a means of giving comfort no i must not say comfort not present comfort but conviction lasting conviction to your sister s mind,austen-sense
your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn marianne,austen-sense
a short account of myself i believe will be necessary and it shall be a short one,austen-sense
he looked pleased by this remembrance and added,austen-sense
i cannot remember the time when i did not love eliza and my affection for her as we grew up was such as perhaps judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity you might think me incapable of having ever felt,austen-sense
and this i fear is all that can be said for the conduct of one who was at once her uncle and guardian,austen-sense
the treachery or the folly of my cousin s maid betrayed us,austen-sense
the consequence of this upon a mind so young so lively so inexperienced as mrs brandon s was but too natural,austen-sense
it was that which threw this gloom even now the recollection of what i suffered,austen-sense
it was nearly three years after this unhappy period before i returned to england,austen-sense
at last however and after i had been six months in england i did find her,austen-sense
that she was to all appearance in the last stage of a consumption was yes in such a situation it was my greatest comfort,austen-sense
their fates their fortunes cannot be the same and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind or a happier marriage she might have been all that you will live to see the other be,austen-sense
i will be more collected more concise,austen-sense
i called her a distant relation but i am well aware that i have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her,austen-sense
he her father a well meaning but not a quick sighted man could really i believe give no information for he had been generally confined to the house while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose and he tried to convince me as thoroughly as he was convinced himself of his daughter s being entirely unconcerned in the business,austen-sense
,austen-sense
no he had already done that which no man who can feel for another would do,austen-sense
his character is now before you expensive dissipated and worse than both,austen-sense
i had no hope of interfering with success and sometimes i thought your sister s influence might yet reclaim him,austen-sense
they proceed from no misconduct and can bring no disgrace,austen-sense
elinor s thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to marianne from the communication of what had passed,austen-sense
one meeting was unavoidable,austen-sense
eliza had confessed to me though most reluctantly the name of her lover and when he returned to town which was within a fortnight after myself we met by appointment he to defend i to punish his conduct,austen-sense
is she still in town,austen-sense
not that marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention made neither objection nor remark attempted no vindication of willoughby and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible,austen-sense
long letters from her quickly succeeding each other arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought to express her anxious solicitude for marianne and entreat she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune,austen-sense
a variety of occupations of objects and of company which could not be procured at barton would be inevitable there and might yet she hoped cheat marianne at times into some interest beyond herself and even into some amusement much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her,austen-sense
but it was a matter of great consolation to her that what brought evil to herself would bring good to her sister and elinor on the other hand suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid edward entirely comforted herself by thinking that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness it would be better for marianne than an immediate return into devonshire,austen-sense
a man of whom he had always had such reason to think well,austen-sense
he would not speak another word to him meet him where he might for all the world,austen-sense
and this was the end of it,austen-sense
she could soon tell at what coachmaker s the new carriage was building by what painter mr willoughby s portrait was drawn and at what warehouse miss grey s clothes might be seen,austen-sense
and by the means of this continual though gentle vent was able not only to see the miss dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies and therefore determined though rather against the opinion of sir john that as mrs willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune to leave her card with her as soon as she married,austen-sense
the good understanding between the colonel and miss dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry tree the canal and the yew arbour would all be made over to her and mrs jennings had for some time ceased to think at all of mrs ferrars,austen-sense
about this time the two miss steeles lately arrived at their cousin s house in bartlett s buildings holburn presented themselves again before their more grand relations in conduit and berkeley streets and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality,austen-sense
i was almost sure you would not leave london yet awhile though you told me you know at barton that you should not stay above a month,austen-sense
elinor perfectly understood her and was forced to use all her self command to make it appear that she did not,austen-sense
cried mrs jennings very pretty indeed,austen-sense
here comes your beau nancy my cousin said t other day when she saw him crossing the street to the house,austen-sense
no indeed,austen-sense
oh yes i dare say you will,austen-sense
why their visit is but just begun,austen-sense
my sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head aches which make her unfit for company or conversation,austen-sense
oh if that s all cried miss steele we can just as well go and see her,austen-sense
when they stopped at the door mrs jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call and as she had no business at gray s it was resolved that while her young friends transacted their s she should pay her visit and return for them,austen-sense
marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment on this impertinent examination of their features and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick cases presented to his inspection by remaining unconscious of it all for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herself and be as ignorant of what was passing around her in mr gray s shop as in her own bedroom,austen-sense
their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in mr gray s shop,austen-sense
this morning i had fully intended to call on you if i could possibly find a spare half hour but one has always so much to do on first coming to town,austen-sense
as my mother in law s relations i shall be happy to show them every respect,austen-sense
but so it ought to be they are people of large fortune they are related to you and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected,austen-sense
mr dashwood attended them down stairs was introduced to mrs jennings at the door of her carriage and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day took leave,austen-sense
after staying with them half an hour he asked elinor to walk with him to conduit street and introduce him to sir john and lady middleton,austen-sense
yes he has very good property in dorsetshire,austen-sense
he likes you,austen-sense
indeed i believe you replied elinor but i am very sure that colonel brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying me,austen-sense
and there can be no reason why you should not try for him,austen-sense
recollecting himself however he added that is i mean to say your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled fanny particularly for she has your interest very much at heart i assure you,austen-sense
is mr edward ferrars said elinor with resolution going to be married,austen-sense
miss morton only daughter of the late lord morton with thirty thousand pounds,austen-sense
he paused for her assent and compassion and she forced herself to say,austen-sense
and then i have made a little purchase within this half year east kingham farm you must remember the place where old gibson used to live,austen-sense
why i hope not that,austen-sense
far be it from me to repine at his doing so he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose but in consequence of it we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen china c to supply the place of what was taken away,austen-sense
where is the green house to be,austen-sense
elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself and was very thankful that marianne was not present to share the provocation,austen-sense
few people of common prudence will do that and whatever she saves she will be able to dispose of,austen-sense
but she raises none in those most concerned,austen-sense
she is not well she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks,austen-sense
there was something in her style of beauty to please them particularly,austen-sense
i know very little of dorsetshire but my dear elinor i shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it and i think i can answer for your having fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors,austen-sense
sir john was ready to like anybody and though mr dashwood did not seem to know much about horses he soon set him down as a very good natured fellow while lady middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having and mr dashwood went away delighted with both,austen-sense
your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting her which to say the truth has been a little the case and very naturally for we only knew that mrs jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way and fanny and mrs ferrars were both strongly prepossessed that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as fanny would like to associate with,austen-sense
there was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides which mutually attracted them and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor and a general want of understanding,austen-sense
he dared not come to bartlett s buildings for fear of detection and though their mutual impatience to meet was not to be told they could do nothing at present but write,austen-sense
their sisters and mrs jennings were invited likewise and john dashwood was careful to secure colonel brandon who always glad to be where the miss dashwoods were received his eager civilities with some surprise but much more pleasure,austen-sense
their claims to the notice of mrs john dashwood as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother might not have done much however towards procuring them seats at her table but as lady middleton s guests they must be welcome and lucy who had long wanted to be personally known to the family to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them had seldom been happier in her life than she was on receiving mrs john dashwood s card,austen-sense
the important tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies to this formidable mother in law,austen-sense
elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of its being miss morton s mother rather than her own whom they were about to behold but instead of doing that she assured her and with great sincerity that she did pity her to the utter amazement of lucy who though really uncomfortable herself hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to elinor,austen-sense
she could not but smile to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person for lucy was particularly distinguished whom of all others had they known as much as she did they would have been most anxious to mortify while she herself who had comparatively no power to wound them sat pointedly slighted by both,austen-sense
john dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing and his wife had still less,austen-sense
the two mothers though each really convinced that her own son was the tallest politely decided in favour of the other,austen-sense
these are done by my eldest sister said he and you as a man of taste will i dare say be pleased with them,austen-sense
perhaps fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude enough for colouring a little she immediately said,austen-sense
but she does every thing well,austen-sense
fanny looked very angry too and her husband was all in a fright at his sister s audacity,austen-sense
don t let them make you unhappy,austen-sense
in a few minutes however marianne was recovered enough to put an end to the bustle and sit down among the rest though her spirits retained the impression of what had passed the whole evening,austen-sense
elinor s curiosity to see mrs ferrars was satisfied she had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable she had seen enough of her pride her meanness and her determined prejudice against herself to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement and retarded the marriage of edward and herself had he been otherwise free and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her own sake that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of mrs ferrars s creation preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice or any solicitude for her good opinion,austen-sense
my dear friend cried lucy as soon as they were by themselves i come to talk to you of my happiness,austen-sense
civil did you see nothing but only civility i saw a vast deal more,austen-sense
you shan t talk me out of my satisfaction,austen-sense
are you ill miss dashwood you seem low you don t speak sure you an t well,austen-sense
elinor tried to make a civil answer though doubting her own success,austen-sense
i am sure i should have seen it in a moment if mrs ferrars had took a dislike to me,austen-sense
it was a very awkward moment and the countenance of each shewed that it was so,austen-sense
she could therefore only look her tenderness and after slightly addressing him said no more,austen-sense
lucy with a demure and settled air seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others and would not say a word and almost every thing that was said proceeded from elinor who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother s health their coming to town c which edward ought to have inquired about but never did,austen-sense
dear edward,austen-sense
oh don t think of me,austen-sense
do you like london,austen-sense
you are what you always were,austen-sense
but marianne who saw his agitation and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself was perfectly satisfied and soon talked of something else,austen-sense
i was engaged elsewhere,austen-sense
not so indeed for seriously speaking i am very sure that conscience only kept edward from harley street,austen-sense
are you never to hear yourself praised then you must be no friend of mine for those who will accept of my love and esteem must submit to my open commendation,austen-sense
but even this encouragement failed for he would go and lucy who would have outstaid him had his visit lasted two hours soon afterwards went away,austen-sense
it is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves,austen-sense
all that she could hope was that edward would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing marianne s mistaken warmth nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting and this she had every reason to expect,austen-sense
for their own comfort they would much rather have remained at least all the morning in mrs jennings s house but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody,austen-sense
it was censure in common use and easily given,austen-sense
would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between marianne and mr willoughby she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner which their arrival occasioned,austen-sense
all these jealousies and discontents however were so totally unsuspected by mrs jennings that she thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together and generally congratulated her young friends every night on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long,austen-sense
it so happened that while her two sisters with mrs jennings were first calling on her in harley street another of her acquaintance had dropt in a circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her,austen-sense
but that was not enough for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from them,austen-sense
with such encouragement as this was she dismissed on the present occasion to her brother s carriage which they were ready to enter five minutes after it stopped at the door a punctuality not very agreeable to their sister in law who had preceded them to the house of her acquaintance and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman,austen-sense
she perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself and speaking familiarly to her brother and had just determined to find out his name from the latter when they both came towards her and mr dashwood introduced him to her as mr robert ferrars,austen-sense
why they were different robert exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour s conversation for talking of his brother and lamenting the extreme gaucherie which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any natural deficiency than to the misfortune of a private education while he himself though probably without any particular any material superiority by nature merely from the advantage of a public school was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man,austen-sense
if you had only sent him to westminster as well as myself instead of sending him to mr pratt s all this would have been prevented,austen-sense
he bestowed his hearty approbation however on their species of house,austen-sense
i was to decide on the best of them,austen-sense
lady elliott wished to give a dance,austen-sense
the dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease card tables may be placed in the drawing room the library may be open for tea and other refreshments and let the supper be set out in the saloon,austen-sense
as john dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else and a thought struck him during the evening which he communicated to his wife for her approbation when they got home,austen-sense
you know i am always ready to pay them any attention in my power as my taking them out this evening shews,austen-sense
fanny paused a moment and then with fresh vigor said,austen-sense
i am sure you will like them indeed you do like them you know very much already and so does my mother and they are such favourites with harry,austen-sense
mrs dashwood seemed actually working for her herself cherishing all her hopes and promoting all her views,austen-sense
the miss steeles removed to harley street and all that reached elinor of their influence there strengthened her expectation of the event,austen-sense
mrs palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her and contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day returned from that period to her own home and her own habits in which she found the miss dashwoods very ready to resume their former share,austen-sense
no ma am,austen-sense
so i looked at it directly and lord,austen-sense
what,austen-sense
so then it all came out and the long and the short of the matter by all i can learn seems to be this,austen-sense
so you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride,austen-sense
and i must say i think she was used very hardly for your sister scolded like any fury and soon drove her into a fainting fit,austen-sense
i declare i have no patience with your sister and i hope with all my heart it will be a match in spite of her,austen-sense
i should not wonder if he was to be in the greatest passion and mr donavan thinks just the same,austen-sense
lord,austen-sense
what mrs ferrars would say and do though there could not be a doubt of its nature she was anxious to hear and still more anxious to know how edward would conduct himself,austen-sense
but unwelcome as such a task must be it was necessary to be done and elinor therefore hastened to perform it,austen-sense
edward seemed a second willoughby and acknowledging as elinor did that she had loved him most sincerely could she feel less than herself,austen-sense
how long has this been known to you elinor,austen-sense
after a pause of wonder she exclaimed,austen-sense
it was not fit that you should then know how much i was the reverse,austen-sense
i owed it to her therefore to avoid giving any hint of the truth and i owed it to my family and friends not to create in them a solicitude about me which it could not be in my power to satisfy,austen-sense
yes,austen-sense
i am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own i have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther,austen-sense
if such is your way of thinking said marianne if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else your resolution your self command are perhaps a little less to be wondered at they are brought more within my comprehension,austen-sense
oh,austen-sense
she listened to her praise of lucy with only moving from one chair to another and when mrs jennings talked of edward s affection it cost her only a spasm in her throat such advances towards heroism in her sister made elinor feel equal to any thing herself,austen-sense
mrs ferrars too in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress but i will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome,austen-sense
she has borne it all with the fortitude of an angel,austen-sense
here he stopped to be thanked which being done he went on,austen-sense
she was quite in an agony,austen-sense
duty affection every thing was disregarded,austen-sense
can this be possible,austen-sense
edward said very little but what he did say was in the most determined manner,austen-sense
i have some little concern in the business as well as yourself for lucy steele is my cousin and i believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world nor one who more deserves a good husband,austen-sense
and to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle s care the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as mrs ferrars is perhaps altogether a little extraordinary,austen-sense
marianne sighed out her similar apprehension and elinor s heart wrung for the feelings of edward while braving his mother s threats for a woman who could not reward him,austen-sense
what indeed ma am,austen-sense
we must all feel for him and the more so because it is totally out of our power to assist him,austen-sense
if he would only have done as well by himself said john dashwood as all his friends were disposed to do by him he might now have been in his proper situation and would have wanted for nothing,austen-sense
said mrs jennings that is her revenge,austen-sense
poor edward,austen-sense
mrs jennings was very warm in her praise of edward s conduct but only elinor and marianne understood its true merit,austen-sense
she felt all the force of that comparison but not as her sister had hoped to urge her to exertion now she felt it with all the pain of continual self reproach regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before but it brought only the torture of penitence without the hope of amendment,austen-sense
mrs jennings and elinor were of the number but marianne who knew that the willoughbys were again in town and had a constant dread of meeting them chose rather to stay at home than venture into so public a place,austen-sense
get it all out of her my dear,austen-sense
i am so glad to meet you said miss steele taking her familiarly by the arm for i wanted to see you of all things in the world,austen-sense
and lady middleton is she angry,austen-sense
i never saw lucy in such a rage in my life,austen-sense
i do not care if it is the doctor s favourite colour,austen-sense
well but miss dashwood speaking triumphantly people may say what they chuse about mr ferrars s declaring he would not have lucy for it is no such thing i can tell you and it is quite a shame for such ill natured reports to be spread abroad,austen-sense
and besides that my cousin richard said himself that when it came to the point he was afraid mr ferrars would be off and when edward did not come near us for three days i could not tell what to think myself and i believe in my heart lucy gave it up all for lost for we came away from your brother s wednesday and we saw nothing of him not all thursday friday and saturday and did not know what was become of him,austen-sense
i heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be,austen-sense
so then he was monstrous happy and talked on some time about what they should do and they agreed he should take orders directly and they must wait to be married till he got a living,austen-sense
miss dashwood do you think people make love when any body else is by,austen-sense
cried elinor have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door,austen-sense
i only stood at the door and heard what i could,austen-sense
what an ill natured woman his mother is an t she,austen-sense
i wonder what curacy he will get good gracious,austen-sense
i write to the doctor indeed,austen-sense
here come the richardsons,austen-sense
i suppose lady middleton won t ask us any more this bout,austen-sense
such was her parting concern for after this she had time only to pay her farewell compliments to mrs jennings before her company was claimed by mrs richardson and elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind,austen-sense
and lord help em,austen-sense
bartlett s building march,austen-sense
i am c,austen-sense
she is a good hearted girl as ever lived very well upon my word,austen-sense
chapter 39,austen-sense
the palmers were to remove to cleveland about the end of march for the easter holidays and mrs jennings with both her friends received a very warm invitation from charlotte to go with them,austen-sense
no i cannot go to cleveland,austen-sense
from cleveland which was within a few miles of bristol the distance to barton was not beyond one day though a long day s journey and their mother s servant might easily come there to attend them down and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at cleveland they might now be at home in little more than three weeks time,austen-sense
colonel i do not know what you and i shall do without the miss dashwoods was mrs jennings s address to him when he first called on her after their leaving her was settled for they are quite resolved upon going home from the palmers and how forlorn we shall be when i come back lord,austen-sense
she wondered indeed at his thinking it necessary to do so but supposed it to be the proper etiquette,austen-sense
what should hinder it,austen-sense
mrs jennings was delighted with her gratitude and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence the colonel should be able to take leave of them as he immediately did with the utmost sang froid and go away without making her any reply she had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor,austen-sense
i have seen mr ferrars two or three times in harley street and am much pleased with him,austen-sense
pray assure him of it,austen-sense
it was an office in short from which unwilling to give edward the pain of receiving an obligation from her she would have been very glad to be spared herself but colonel brandon on motives of equal delicacy declining it likewise still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means that she would not on any account make farther opposition,austen-sense
by which the colonel was surprised to find that she was considering mr ferrars s marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation for he did not suppose it possible that delaford living could supply such an income as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on and he said so,austen-sense
his marriage must still be a distant good at least i am afraid it cannot take place very soon,austen-sense
thank you ma am said elinor,austen-sense
lord,austen-sense
repeated mrs jennings oh,austen-sense
and as to the house being a bad one i do not know what the colonel would be at for it is as good a one as ever i saw,austen-sense
well my dear i must be gone before i have had half my talk out,austen-sense
oh,austen-sense
i shall do that directly,austen-sense
oh ho i understand you,austen-sense
should not the colonel write himself sure he is the proper person,austen-sense
however i will not disturb you seeing her preparing to write,austen-sense
i have just been thinking of betty s sister my dear,austen-sense
certainly ma am replied elinor not hearing much of what she said and more anxious to be alone than to be mistress of the subject,austen-sense
her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance,austen-sense
you would not have gone however said elinor recovering herself and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible without receiving our good wishes even if we had not been able to give them in person,austen-sense
allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well judging a friend and to join in his wish that the living it is about two hundred a year were much more considerable and such as might better enable you to as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself such in short as might establish all your views of happiness,austen-sense
colonel brandon give me a living can it be possible,austen-sense
i have had no hand in it,austen-sense
colonel brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability,austen-sense
colonel brandon i think lodges in st james street said he soon afterwards rising from his chair,austen-sense
and with this pleasing anticipation she sat down to reconsider the past recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of edward and of course to reflect on her own with discontent,austen-sense
well and how soon will he be ready for it seems all to depend upon that,austen-sense
lord bless me i am sure it would put me quite out of patience and though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor mr ferrars i do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him,austen-sense
ferrars,austen-sense
the colonel is a ninny my dear because he has two thousand a year himself he thinks that nobody else can marry on less,austen-sense
her own happiness and her own spirits were at least very certain and she joined mrs jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in delaford parsonage before michaelmas,austen-sense
the consequence was that elinor set out by herself to pay a visit for which no one could really have less inclination and to run the risk of a tete a tete with a woman whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike,austen-sense
now especially there cannot be but however you and marianne were always great favourites why would not marianne come,austen-sense
it is perfectly true colonel brandon has given the living of delaford to edward,austen-sense
i suppose however on recollection that the case may probably be this,austen-sense
a very simple one to be of use to mr,austen-sense
but why should such precaution be used though it is not to be supposed that mrs ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon for that must be quite out of the question yet why upon her late behaviour is she supposed to feel at all she has done with her son she cast him off for ever and has made all those over whom she had any influence cast him off likewise,austen-sense
mrs ferrars can never forget that edward is her son,austen-sense
we think now said mr dashwood after a short pause of robert s marrying miss morton,austen-sense
certainly there can be no difference for robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son and as to any thing else they are both very agreeable young men i do not know that one is superior to the other,austen-sense
it would have been beyond comparison she said the least evil of the two and she would be glad to compound now for nothing worse,austen-sense
has colonel brandon been with you lately,austen-sense
he laughed most immoderately,austen-sense
we may treat it as a joke said he at last recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment but upon my soul it is a most serious business,austen-sense
i could not believe it my mother was the first person who told me of it and i feeling myself called on to act with resolution immediately said to her my dear madam i do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion but as for myself i must say that if edward does marry this young woman i never will see him again,austen-sense
the merest awkward country girl without style or elegance and almost without beauty i remember her perfectly,austen-sense
my dear fellow i should have said consider what you are doing,austen-sense
he had just settled this point with great composure when the entrance of mrs john dashwood put an end to the subject,austen-sense
it amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send her to delaford a place in which of all others she would now least chuse to visit or wish to reside for not only was it considered as her future home by her brother and mrs jennings but even lucy when they parted gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there,austen-sense
elinor s satisfaction at the moment of removal was more positive,austen-sense
it had no park but the pleasure grounds were tolerably extensive and like every other place of the same degree of importance it had its open shrubbery and closer wood walk a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation led to the front the lawn was dotted over with timber the house itself was under the guardianship of the fir the mountain ash and the acacia and a thick screen of them altogether interspersed with tall lombardy poplars shut out the offices,austen-sense
with great surprise therefore did she find herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner,austen-sense
nothing was wanting on mrs palmer s side that constant and friendly good humour could do to make them feel themselves welcome,austen-sense
for the rest of his character and habits they were marked as far as elinor could perceive with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life,austen-sense
two delighful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery but all over the grounds and especially in the most distant parts of them where there was something more of wildness than in the rest where the trees were the oldest and the grass was the longest and wettest had assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings given marianne a cold so violent as though for a day or two trifled with or denied would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body and the notice of herself,austen-sense
but a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand which she was unable to read or in lying weary and languid on a sofa did not speak much in favour of her amendment and when at last she went early to bed more and more indisposed colonel brandon was only astonished at her sister s composure who though attending and nursing her the whole day against marianne inclination and forcing proper medicines on her at night trusted like marianne to the certainty and efficacy of sleep and felt no real alarm,austen-sense
mrs jennings however with a kindness of heart which made elinor really love her declared her resolution of not stirring from cleveland as long as marianne remained ill and of endeavouring by her own attentive care to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from and elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate desirous to share in all her fatigues and often by her better experience in nursing of material use,austen-sense
marianne was of course kept in ignorance of all these arrangements,austen-sense
mrs jennings had determined very early in the seizure that marianne would never get over it and colonel brandon who was chiefly of use in listening to mrs jennings s forebodings was not in a state of mind to resist their influence,austen-sense
but the day did not close so auspiciously as it began towards the evening marianne became ill again growing more heavy restless and uncomfortable than before,austen-sense
is mama coming,austen-sense
elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself and while attempting to soothe her eagerly felt her pulse,austen-sense
her fears and her difficulties were immediately before him,austen-sense
he meanwhile whatever he might feel acted with all the firmness of a collected mind made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch and calculated with exactness the time in which she might look for his return,austen-sense
hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on marianne s side and in the most cruel anxiety on elinor s before mr harris appeared,austen-sense
he promised to call again in the course of three or four hours and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them,austen-sense
on mrs jennings s compassion she had other claims,austen-sense
elinor catching all and more than all his fears in a moment proposed to call in further advice,austen-sense
mrs jennings though forced on examination to acknowledge a temporary revival tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance and elinor conning over every injunction of distrust told herself likewise not to hope,austen-sense
her breath her skin her lips all flattered elinor with signs of amendment and marianne fixed her eyes on her with a rational though languid gaze,austen-sense
her joy was of a different kind and led to any thing rather than to gaiety,austen-sense
the time was now drawing on when colonel brandon might be expected back,austen-sense
mrs jennings would have persuaded her at its conclusion to take some rest before her mother s arrival and allow her to take her place by marianne but elinor had no sense of fatigue no capability of sleep at that moment about her and she was not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant,austen-sense
the clock struck eight,austen-sense
never in her life had elinor found it so difficult to be calm as at that moment,austen-sense
chapter 44,austen-sense
the servants i suppose forgot to tell you that mr palmer was not in the house,austen-sense
sit down and i will be both,austen-sense
he took the opposite chair and for half a minute not a word was said by either,austen-sense
god be praised but is it true,austen-sense
we hope she is,austen-sense
mr willoughby i advise you at present to return to combe i am not at leisure to remain with you longer whatever your business may be with me will it be better recollected and explained to morrow,austen-sense
the steadiness of his manner and the intelligence of his eye as he spoke convincing elinor that whatever other unpardonable folly might bring him to cleveland he was not brought there by intoxication she said after a moment s recollection,austen-sense
is this the real reason of your coming,austen-sense
but she shall forgive me again and on more reasonable grounds now will you listen to me,austen-sense
but at first i must confess my vanity only was elevated by it,austen-sense
i insist on you hearing the whole of it he replied my fortune was never large and i had always been expensive always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself,austen-sense
you did then said elinor a little softened believe yourself at one time attached to her,austen-sense
at last however my resolution was taken and i had determined as soon as i could engage her alone to justify the attentions i had so invariably paid her and openly assure her of an affection which i had already taken such pains to display,austen-sense
and how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business i confess is beyond my comprehension,austen-sense
if the violence of her passions the weakness of her understanding i do not mean however to defend myself,austen-sense
how infinitely superior,austen-sense
but upon my soul i did not know it he warmly replied i did not recollect that i had omitted to give her my direction and common sense might have told her how to find it out,austen-sense
the matter itself i could not deny and vain was every endeavour to soften it,austen-sense
she offered to forgive the past if i would marry eliza,austen-sense
i had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife if i chose to address her and i persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do,austen-sense
why did you call mr,austen-sense
the sight of your dear sister however was really dreadful and to heighten the matter i found her alone,austen-sense
her sorrow her disappointment her deep regret when i told her that i was obliged to leave devonshire so immediately i never shall forget it united too with such reliance such confidence in me oh god what a hard hearted rascal i was,austen-sense
i cannot think of it it won t do then came your dear mother to torture me farther with all her kindness and confidence,austen-sense
i owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid rascally folly of my own heart that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now,austen-sense
ah no have you forgot what passed in town that infamous letter did she shew it you,austen-sense
this is not right mr,austen-sense
but this note made me know myself better,austen-sense
i sent no answer to marianne intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice and for some time i was even determined not to call in berkeley street but at last judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool common acquaintance than anything else i watched you all safely out of the house one morning and left my name,austen-sense
lodging as i did in bond street there was hardly a day in which i did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight could have separated us so long,austen-sense
i could not answer it,austen-sense
well at last as i need not tell you you were forced on me and what a sweet figure i cut what an evening of agony it was marianne beautiful as an angel on one side calling me willoughby in such a tone oh god holding out her hand to me asking me for an explanation with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face and sophia jealous as the devil on the other hand looking all that was well it does not signify it is over now such an evening i ran away from you all as soon as i could but not before i had seen marianne s sweet face as white as death that was the last last look i ever had of her the last manner in which she appeared to me,austen-sense
well let me make haste and be gone,austen-sense
yes yes that in particular,austen-sense
some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in devonshire and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was and made her more jealous than ever,austen-sense
and in short what do you think of my wife s style of letter writing delicate tender truly feminine was it not,austen-sense
preparation day in honest words her money was necessary to me and in a situation like mine any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture,austen-sense
and the lock of hair that too i had always carried about me in the same pocket book which was now searched by madam with the most ingratiating virulence the dear lock all every memento was torn from me,austen-sense
she must be attached to you or she would not have married you,austen-sense
you have proved your heart less wicked much less wicked,austen-sense
tell her of my misery and my penitence tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her and if you will that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever,austen-sense
as bluntly as he could speak it therefore he told me that marianne dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at cleveland a letter that morning received from mrs jennings declared her danger most imminent the palmers are all gone off in a fright c i was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning sir john,austen-sense
elinor made no answer,austen-sense
the attachment from which against honour against feeling against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself now when no longer allowable governed every thought and the connection for the sake of which he had with little scruple left her sister to misery was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature,austen-sense
i have business there from thence to town in a day or two,austen-sense
said he letting it fall and leaning against the mantel piece as if forgetting he was to go,austen-sense
if however i am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions it may be the means it may put me on my guard at least it may be something to live for,austen-sense
i shall now go away and live in dread of one event,austen-sense
but she will be gained by some one else,austen-sense
elinor for some time after he left her for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died away remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas widely differing in themselves but of which sadness was the general result to think even of her sister,austen-sense
elinor s heart was full,austen-sense
he shared it however in a silence even greater than her own,austen-sense
willoughby poor willoughby as she now allowed herself to call him was constantly in her thoughts she would not but have heard his vindication for the world and now blamed now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before,austen-sense
marianne continued to mend every day and the brilliant cheerfulness of mrs dashwood s looks and spirits proved her to be as she repeatedly declared herself one of the happiest women in the world,austen-sense
at last we are alone,austen-sense
you are never like me dear elinor or i should wonder at your composure now,austen-sense
it came out quite unawares quite undesignedly,austen-sense
colonel brandon s character said elinor as an excellent man is well established,austen-sense
what answer did you give him did you allow him to hope,austen-sense
his was an involuntary confidence an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend not an application to a parent,austen-sense
there however he is quite mistaken,austen-sense
and his manners the colonel s manners are not only more pleasing to me than willoughby s ever were but they are of a kind i well know to be more solidly attaching to marianne,austen-sense
poor elinor here was a new scheme for getting her to delaford but her spirit was stubborn,austen-sense
when there at her own particular request for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother colonel brandon was invited to visit her,austen-sense
at his and mrs jennings s united request in return mrs dashwood was prevailed on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back for the better accommodation of her sick child and the colonel at the joint invitation of mrs dashwood and mrs jennings whose active good nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage in the course of a few weeks,austen-sense
to elinor the observation of the latter was particularly grateful,austen-sense
after dinner she would try her piano forte,austen-sense
we will walk to the farm at the edge of the down and see how the children go on we will walk to sir john s new plantations at barton cross and the abbeyland and we will often go the old ruins of the priory and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached,austen-sense
our own library is too well known to me to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement,austen-sense
willing therefore to delay the evil hour she resolved to wait till her sister s health were more secure before she appointed it,austen-sense
there exactly there pointing with one hand on that projecting mound there i fell and there i first saw willoughby,austen-sense
elinor tenderly invited her to be open,austen-sense
if you could be assured of that you think you should be easy,austen-sense
elinor said no more,austen-sense
no,austen-sense
long before i was enough recovered to talk i was perfectly able to reflect,austen-sense
i did not know my danger till the danger was removed but with such feelings as these reflections gave me i wonder at my recovery wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live to have time for atonement to my god and to you all did not kill me at once,austen-sense
the kindness the unceasing kindness of mrs jennings i had repaid with ungrateful contempt,austen-sense
here ceased the rapid flow of her self reproving spirit and elinor impatient to soothe though too honest to flatter gave her instantly that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved,austen-sense
i shall now live solely for my family,austen-sense
but it shall be regulated it shall be checked by religion by reason by constant employment,austen-sense
a thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart but she dared not urge one,austen-sense
chapter 47,austen-sense
nothing could replace him therefore in her former esteem nor injure the interests of colonel brandon,austen-sense
i wish to assure you both said she that i see every thing as you can desire me to do,austen-sense
i never could have been happy with him after knowing as sooner or later i must have known all this i should have had no confidence no esteem,austen-sense
you consider the matter said elinor exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it and i dare say you perceive as well as myself not only in this but in many other circumstances reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection on his side much less certain,austen-sense
marianne s lips quivered and she repeated the word selfish,austen-sense
it is very true,austen-sense
his circumstances are now unembarrassed he suffers from no evil of that kind and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself,austen-sense
rather say your mother s imprudence my child said mrs dashwood she must be answerable,austen-sense
her daughter did not look however as if much of it were heard by her,austen-sense
some letters had passed between her and her brother in consequence of marianne s illness and in the first of john s there had been this sentence we know nothing of our unfortunate edward and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject but conclude him to be still at oxford which was all the intelligence of edward afforded her by the correspondence for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters,austen-sense
mrs dashwood whose eyes as she answered the servant s inquiry had intuitively taken the same direction was shocked to perceive by elinor s countenance how much she really suffered and a moment afterwards alike distressed by marianne s situation knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention,austen-sense
i see mr ferrars myself ma am this morning in exeter and his lady too miss steele as was,austen-sense
she smiled and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts,austen-sense
elinor s heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward and mrs dashwood probably found the same explanation,austen-sense
and are they going farther westward,austen-sense
she observed in a low voice to her mother that they were probably going down to mr pratt s near plymouth,austen-sense
did mrs ferrars look well,austen-sense
when the dessert and the wine were arranged and mrs dashwood and elinor were left by themselves they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence,austen-sense
chapter 48,austen-sense
but she soon saw how likely it was that lucy in her self provident care in her haste to secure him should overlook every thing but the risk of delay,austen-sense
in edward she knew not what she saw nor what she wished to see happy or unhappy nothing pleased her she turned away her head from every sketch of him,austen-sense
was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on,austen-sense
scarcely had she so determined it when the figure of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window,austen-sense
were it possible she must say it must be edward,austen-sense
i will be calm i will be mistress of myself,austen-sense
they all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor,austen-sense
he coloured and stammered out an unintelligible reply,austen-sense
it was put an end to by mrs dashwood who felt obliged to hope that he had left mrs ferrars very well,austen-sense
at longstaple,austen-sense
perhaps you mean my brother you mean mrs mrs robert ferrars,austen-sense
his words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but elinor who sat with her head leaning over her work in a state of such agitation as made her hardly know where she was,austen-sense
chapter 49,austen-sense
this only need be said that when they all sat down to table at four o clock about three hours after his arrival he had secured his lady engaged her mother s consent and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover but in the reality of reason and truth one of the happiest of men,austen-sense
his heart was now open to elinor all its weaknesses all its errors confessed and his first boyish attachment to lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty four,austen-sense
she was pretty too at least i thought so then and i had seen so little of other women that i could make no comparisons and see no defects,austen-sense
comparisons would occur regrets would arise and her joy though sincere as her love for her sister was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language,austen-sense
lucy s marriage the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers and elinor s particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard,austen-sense
she repeated it to edward,austen-sense
not the smallest suspicion therefore had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed and when at last it burst on him in a letter from lucy herself he had been for some time he believed half stupified between the wonder the horror and the joy of such a deliverance,austen-sense
i can safely say i owe you no ill will and am sure you will be too generous to do us any ill offices,austen-sense
elinor read and returned it without any comment,austen-sense
she will hardly be less hurt i suppose by robert s marrying lucy than she would have been by your marrying her,austen-sense
it was his business however to say that he did and he said it very prettily,austen-sense
i thought it my duty said he independent of my feelings to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not when i was renounced by my mother and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me,austen-sense
and at any rate she lost nothing by continuing the engagement for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions,austen-sense
he could only plead an ignorance of his own heart and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement,austen-sense
edward heard with pleasure of colonel brandon s being expected at the cottage as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of delaford which at present said he after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion he must think i have never forgiven him for offering,austen-sense
edward had two thousand pounds and elinor one which with delaford living was all that they could call their own for it was impossible that mrs dashwood should advance anything and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a year would supply them with the comforts of life,austen-sense
a three weeks residence at delaford where in his evening hours at least he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty six and seventeen brought him to barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in marianne s looks all the kindness of her welcome and all the encouragement of her mother s language to make it cheerful,austen-sense
their resemblance in good principles and good sense in disposition and manner of thinking would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship without any other attraction but their being in love with two sisters and two sisters fond of each other made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment,austen-sense
and i must say that lucy s crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all,austen-sense
robert s offence was unpardonable but lucy s was infinitely worse,austen-sense
this paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of edward,austen-sense
he agreed that he might,austen-sense
after a proper resistance on the part of mrs ferrars just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring the reproach of being too amiable edward was admitted to her presence and pronounced to be again her son,austen-sense
mrs ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying miss dashwood by every argument in her power told him that in miss morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune and enforced the assertion by observing that miss morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds while miss dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than three but when she found that though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation he was by no means inclined to be guided by it she judged it wisest from the experience of the past to submit and therefore after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity and as served to prevent every suspicion of good will she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of edward and elinor,austen-sense
mrs jennings s prophecies though rather jumbled together were chiefly fulfilled for she was able to visit edward and his wife in their parsonage by michaelmas and she found in elinor and her husband as she really believed one of the happiest couples in the world,austen-sense
but i confess it would give me great pleasure to call colonel brandon brother,austen-sense
the selfish sagacity of the latter which had at first drawn robert into the scrape was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it for her respectful humility assiduous attentions and endless flatteries as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise reconciled mrs ferrars to his choice and re established him completely in her favour,austen-sense
some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted which could only be removed by another half hour s discourse with himself,austen-sense
they passed some months in great happiness at dawlish for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages and from thence returning to town procured the forgiveness of mrs ferrars by the simple expedient of asking it which at lucy s instigation was adopted,austen-sense
what edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son might have puzzled many people to find out and what robert had done to succeed to it might have puzzled them still more,austen-sense
precious as was the company of her daughter to her she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend and to see marianne settled at the mansion house was equally the wish of edward and elinor,austen-sense
she was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship voluntarily to give her hand to another and that other a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment whom two years before she had considered too old to be married and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat,austen-sense
willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang and his punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of mrs smith who by stating his marriage with a woman of character as the source of her clemency gave him reason for believing that had he behaved with honour towards marianne he might at once have been happy and rich,austen-sense
for marianne however in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing that befell her and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after days as bearing no comparison with mrs brandon,austen-sense
the old testament of the king james bible,bible-kjv
1 3 and god said let there be light and there was light,bible-kjv
1 7 and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so,bible-kjv
1 11 and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so,bible-kjv
1 17 and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth 1 18 and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good,bible-kjv
1 23 and the evening and the morning were the fifth day,bible-kjv
1 28 and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth,bible-kjv
2 1 thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them,bible-kjv
2 7 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul,bible-kjv
2 13 and the name of the second river is gihon the same is it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia,bible-kjv
2 18 and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him an help meet for him,bible-kjv
2 24 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh,bible-kjv
3 4 and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die 3 5 for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil,bible-kjv
3 10 and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself,bible-kjv
and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat,bible-kjv
3 21 unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothed them,bible-kjv
and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground,bible-kjv
4 6 and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth,bible-kjv
4 8 and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him,bible-kjv
4 11 and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother s blood from thy hand 4 12 when thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth,bible-kjv
4 16 and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden,bible-kjv
4 21 and his brother s name was jubal he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ,bible-kjv
4 26 and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord,bible-kjv
5 9 and enos lived ninety years and begat cainan 5 10 and enos lived after he begat cainan eight hundred and fifteen years and begat sons and daughters 5 11 and all the days of enos were nine hundred and five years and he died,bible-kjv
5 25 and methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years and begat lamech,bible-kjv
6 1 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them 6 2 that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose,bible-kjv
6 7 and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them,bible-kjv
6 12 and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth,bible-kjv
6 17 and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven and every thing that is in the earth shall die,bible-kjv
6 22 thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so did he,bible-kjv
7 5 and noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him,bible-kjv
7 11 in the six hundredth year of noah s life in the second month the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened,bible-kjv
7 17 and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters increased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth,bible-kjv
7 23 and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark,bible-kjv
8 6 and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made 8 7 and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth,bible-kjv
8 14 and in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth dried,bible-kjv
8 21 and the lord smelled a sweet savour and the lord said in his heart i will not again curse the ground any more for man s sake for the imagination of man s heart is evil from his youth neither will i again smite any more every thing living as i have done,bible-kjv
9 4 but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eat,bible-kjv
9 11 and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth,bible-kjv
9 18 and the sons of noah that went forth of the ark were shem and ham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan,bible-kjv
9 24 and noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done unto him,bible-kjv
9 29 and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years and he died,bible-kjv
10 5 by these were the isles of the gentiles divided in their lands every one after his tongue after their families in their nations,bible-kjv
10 10 and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and erech and accad and calneh in the land of shinar,bible-kjv
10 20 these are the sons of ham after their families after their tongues in their countries and in their nations,bible-kjv
10 25 and unto eber were born two sons the name of one was peleg for in his days was the earth divided and his brother s name was joktan,bible-kjv
11 1 and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech,bible-kjv
11 5 and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded,bible-kjv
11 10 these are the generations of shem shem was an hundred years old and begat arphaxad two years after the flood 11 11 and shem lived after he begat arphaxad five hundred years and begat sons and daughters,bible-kjv
11 20 and reu lived two and thirty years and begat serug 11 21 and reu lived after he begat serug two hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters,bible-kjv
11 28 and haran died before his father terah in the land of his nativity in ur of the chaldees,bible-kjv
12 1 now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father s house unto a land that i will shew thee 12 2 and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing 12 3 and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed,bible-kjv
12 7 and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i give this land and there builded he an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him,bible-kjv
12 13 say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee,bible-kjv
12 18 and pharaoh called abram and said what is this that thou hast done unto me,bible-kjv
13 1 and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south,bible-kjv
13 7 and there was a strife between the herdmen of abram s cattle and the herdmen of lot s cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land,bible-kjv
13 11 then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other,bible-kjv
13 17 arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for i will give it unto thee,bible-kjv
14 5 and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him and smote the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim and the zuzims in ham and the emins in shaveh kiriathaim 14 6 and the horites in their mount seir unto elparan which is by the wilderness,bible-kjv
14 12 and they took lot abram s brother s son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed,bible-kjv
14 17 and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him at the valley of shaveh which is the king s dale,bible-kjv
14 22 and abram said to the king of sodom i have lift up mine hand unto the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth 14 23 that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet and that i will not take any thing that is thine lest thou shouldest say i have made abram rich 14 24 save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with me aner eshcol and mamre let them take their portion,bible-kjv
15 5 and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be,bible-kjv
15 10 and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not,bible-kjv
15 16 but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full,bible-kjv
and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai,bible-kjv
and when sarai dealt hardly with her she fled from her face,bible-kjv
16 9 and the angel of the lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands,bible-kjv
16 14 wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi behold it is between kadesh and bered,bible-kjv
17 3 and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying 17 4 as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations,bible-kjv
17 9 and god said unto abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations,bible-kjv
17 14 and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant,bible-kjv
17 18 and abraham said unto god o that ishmael might live before thee,bible-kjv
17 23 and abraham took ishmael his son and all that were born in his house and all that were bought with his money every male among the men of abraham s house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day as god had said unto him,bible-kjv
18 1 and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamre and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day 18 2 and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground 18 3 and said my lord if now i have found favour in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant 18 4 let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree 18 5 and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come to your servant,bible-kjv
18 9 and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife,bible-kjv
18 12 therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also,bible-kjv
and he said nay but thou didst laugh,bible-kjv
18 22 and the men turned their faces from thence and went toward sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord,bible-kjv
18 27 and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord which am but dust and ashes 18 28 peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five,bible-kjv
and he said i will not do it if i find thirty there,bible-kjv
18 33 and the lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with abraham and abraham returned unto his place,bible-kjv
bring them out unto us that we may know them,bible-kjv
and they pressed sore upon the man even lot and came near to break the door,bible-kjv
19 14 and lot went out and spake unto his sons in law which married his daughters and said up get you out of this place for the lord will destroy this city,bible-kjv
19 18 and lot said unto them oh not so my lord 19 19 behold now thy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life and i cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and i die 19 20 behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one oh let me escape thither is it not a little one,bible-kjv
19 23 the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into zoar,bible-kjv
19 30 and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters,bible-kjv
19 36 thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father,bible-kjv
20 3 but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to him behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou hast taken for she is a man s wife,bible-kjv
20 7 now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine,bible-kjv
20 10 and abimelech said unto abraham what sawest thou that thou hast done this thing,bible-kjv
20 15 and abimelech said behold my land is before thee dwell where it pleaseth thee,bible-kjv
21 2 for sarah conceived and bare abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him,bible-kjv
21 7 and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah should have given children suck,bible-kjv
21 11 and the thing was very grievous in abraham s sight because of his son,bible-kjv
21 16 and she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as it were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of the child,bible-kjv
21 19 and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink,bible-kjv
21 25 and abraham reproved abimelech because of a well of water which abimelech s servants had violently taken away,bible-kjv
21 30 and he said for these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand that they may be a witness unto me that i have digged this well,bible-kjv
22 1 and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am,bible-kjv
22 6 and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together,bible-kjv
22 10 and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son,bible-kjv
22 15 and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time 22 16 and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son 22 17 that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies 22 18 and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice,bible-kjv
23 1 and sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old these were the years of the life of sarah,bible-kjv
23 8 and he communed with them saying if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and intreat for me to ephron the son of zohar 23 9 that he may give me the cave of machpelah which he hath which is in the end of his field for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you,bible-kjv
bury therefore thy dead,bible-kjv
24 1 and abraham was old and well stricken in age and the lord had blessed abraham in all things,bible-kjv
24 8 and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither again,bible-kjv
24 13 behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water 24 14 and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master,bible-kjv
24 19 and when she had done giving him drink she said i will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking,bible-kjv
24 24 and she said unto him i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah which she bare unto nahor,bible-kjv
24 29 and rebekah had a brother and his name was laban and laban ran out unto the man unto the well,bible-kjv
24 33 and there was set meat before him to eat but he said i will not eat until i have told mine errand,bible-kjv
24 37 and my master made me swear saying thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell 24 38 but thou shalt go unto my father s house and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son,bible-kjv
24 46 and she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said drink and i will give thy camels drink also so i drank and she made the camels drink also,bible-kjv
24 50 then laban and bethuel answered and said the thing proceedeth from the lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good,bible-kjv
24 55 and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at the least ten after that she shall go,bible-kjv
24 59 and they sent away rebekah their sister and her nurse and abraham s servant and his men,bible-kjv
24 64 and rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she lighted off the camel,bible-kjv
25 1 then again abraham took a wife and her name was keturah,bible-kjv
all these were the children of keturah,bible-kjv
25 9 and his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite which is before mamre 25 10 the field which abraham purchased of the sons of heth there was abraham buried and sarah his wife,bible-kjv
25 19 and these are the generations of isaac abraham s son abraham begat isaac 25 20 and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah to wife the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram the sister to laban the syrian,bible-kjv
25 24 and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb,bible-kjv
25 29 and jacob sod pottage and esau came from the field and he was faint 25 30 and esau said to jacob feed me i pray thee with that same red pottage for i am faint therefore was his name called edom,bible-kjv
26 1 and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that was in the days of abraham,bible-kjv
26 9 and abimelech called isaac and said behold of a surety she is thy wife and how saidst thou she is my sister,bible-kjv
26 12 then isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year an hundredfold and the lord blessed him,bible-kjv
26 18 and isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them,bible-kjv
26 23 and he went up from thence to beersheba,bible-kjv
26 28 and they said we saw certainly that the lord was with thee and we said let there be now an oath betwixt us even betwixt us and thee and let us make a covenant with thee 26 29 that thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have sent thee away in peace thou art now the blessed of the lord,bible-kjv
26 34 and esau was forty years old when he took to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and bashemath the daughter of elon the hittite 26 35 which were a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah,bible-kjv
27 6 and rebekah spake unto jacob her son saying behold i heard thy father speak unto esau thy brother saying 27 7 bring me venison and make me savoury meat that i may eat and bless thee before the lord before my death,bible-kjv
27 14 and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and his mother made savoury meat such as his father loved,bible-kjv
and he said because the lord thy god brought it to me,bible-kjv
and he said i am,bible-kjv
27 30 and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting,bible-kjv
where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all before thou camest and have blessed him,bible-kjv
for he hath supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and behold now he hath taken away my blessing,bible-kjv
and esau lifted up his voice and wept,bible-kjv
27 46 and rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth if jacob take a wife of the daughters of heth such as these which are of the daughters of the land what good shall my life do me,bible-kjv
28 6 when esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to padanaram to take him a wife from thence and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge saying thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of canaan 28 7 and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to padanaram 28 8 and esau seeing that the daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father 28 9 then went esau unto ishmael and took unto the wives which he had mahalath the daughter of ishmael abraham s son the sister of nebajoth to be his wife,bible-kjv
28 15 and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of,bible-kjv
28 19 and he called the name of that place bethel but the name of that city was called luz at the first,bible-kjv
29 4 and jacob said unto them my brethren whence be ye,bible-kjv
and they said he is well and behold rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep,bible-kjv
29 11 and jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept,bible-kjv
and he abode with him the space of a month,bible-kjv
29 18 and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter,bible-kjv
29 23 and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her,bible-kjv
29 26 and laban said it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn,bible-kjv
29 31 and when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened her womb but rachel was barren,bible-kjv
30 1 and when rachel saw that she bare jacob no children rachel envied her sister and said unto jacob give me children or else i die,bible-kjv
30 6 and rachel said god hath judged me and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son therefore called she his name dan,bible-kjv
30 11 and leah said a troop cometh and she called his name gad,bible-kjv
30 15 and she said unto her is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband,bible-kjv
30 17 and god hearkened unto leah and she conceived and bare jacob the fifth son,bible-kjv
30 22 and god remembered rachel and god hearkened to her and opened her womb,bible-kjv
30 28 and he said appoint me thy wages and i will give it,bible-kjv
30 32 i will pass through all thy flock to day removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle and all the brown cattle among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of such shall be my hire,bible-kjv
30 37 and jacob took him rods of green poplar and of the hazel and chesnut tree and pilled white strakes in them and made the white appear which was in the rods,bible-kjv
30 42 but when the cattle were feeble he put them not in so the feebler were laban s and the stronger jacob s,bible-kjv
31 4 and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock 31 5 and said unto them i see your father s countenance that it is not toward me as before but the god of my father hath been with me,bible-kjv
31 10 and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived that i lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked speckled and grisled,bible-kjv
31 15 are we not counted of him strangers,bible-kjv
31 20 and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian in that he told him not that he fled,bible-kjv
31 25 then laban overtook jacob,bible-kjv
thou hast now done foolishly in so doing,bible-kjv
for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them,bible-kjv
31 35 and she said to her father let it not displease my lord that i cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me,bible-kjv
set it here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us both,bible-kjv
31 42 except the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had been with me surely thou hadst sent me away now empty,bible-kjv
31 46 and jacob said unto his brethren gather stones and they took stones and made an heap and they did eat there upon the heap,bible-kjv
31 51 and laban said to jacob behold this heap and behold this pillar which i have cast betwixt me and thee 31 52 this heap be witness and this pillar be witness that i will not pass over this heap to thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me for harm,bible-kjv
32 1 and jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him,bible-kjv
32 7 then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bands 32 8 and said if esau come to the one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape,bible-kjv
32 16 and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove by themselves and said unto his servants pass over before me and put a space betwixt drove and drove,bible-kjv
32 19 and so commanded he the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying on this manner shall ye speak unto esau when ye find him,bible-kjv
32 23 and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had,bible-kjv
32 27 and he said unto him what is thy name,bible-kjv
and he blessed him there,bible-kjv
and he divided the children unto leah and unto rachel and unto the two handmaids,bible-kjv
and he said the children which god hath graciously given thy servant,bible-kjv
33 9 and esau said i have enough my brother keep that thou hast unto thyself,bible-kjv
33 13 and he said unto him my lord knoweth that the children are tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if men should overdrive them one day all the flock will die,bible-kjv
33 16 so esau returned that day on his way unto seir,bible-kjv
34 1 and dinah the daughter of leah which she bare unto jacob went out to see the daughters of the land,bible-kjv
34 6 and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to commune with him,bible-kjv
34 11 and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren let me find grace in your eyes and what ye shall say unto me i will give,bible-kjv
34 19 and the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had delight in jacob s daughter and he was more honourable than all the house of his father,bible-kjv
34 24 and unto hamor and unto shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city and every male was circumcised all that went out of the gate of his city,bible-kjv
34 30 and jacob said to simeon and levi ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land among the canaanites and the perizzites and i being few in number they shall gather themselves together against me and slay me and i shall be destroyed i and my house,bible-kjv
35 5 and they journeyed and the terror of god was upon the cities that were round about them and they did not pursue after the sons of jacob,bible-kjv
35 10 and god said unto him thy name is jacob thy name shall not be called any more jacob but israel shall be thy name and he called his name israel,bible-kjv
35 16 and they journeyed from bethel and there was but a little way to come to ephrath and rachel travailed and she had hard labour,bible-kjv
35 21 and israel journeyed and spread his tent beyond the tower of edar,bible-kjv
35 29 and isaac gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people being old and full of days and his sons esau and jacob buried him,bible-kjv
36 7 for their riches were more than that they might dwell together and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of their cattle,bible-kjv
36 13 and these are the sons of reuel nahath and zerah shammah and mizzah these were the sons of bashemath esau s wife,bible-kjv
36 19 these are the sons of esau who is edom and these are their dukes,bible-kjv
36 25 and the children of anah were these dishon and aholibamah the daughter of anah,bible-kjv
36 31 and these are the kings that reigned in the land of edom before there reigned any king over the children of israel,bible-kjv
36 36 and hadad died and samlah of masrekah reigned in his stead,bible-kjv
37 1 and jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of canaan,bible-kjv
37 5 and joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his brethren and they hated him yet the more,bible-kjv
37 9 and he dreamed yet another dream and told it his brethren and said behold i have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me,bible-kjv
37 13 and israel said unto joseph do not thy brethren feed the flock in shechem,bible-kjv
37 15 and a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field and the man asked him saying what seekest thou,bible-kjv
37 19 and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh,bible-kjv
37 25 and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of ishmeelites came from gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh going to carry it down to egypt,bible-kjv
37 29 and reuben returned unto the pit and behold joseph was not in the pit and he rent his clothes,bible-kjv
37 35 and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said for i will go down into the grave unto my son mourning,bible-kjv
38 3 and she conceived and bare a son and he called his name er,bible-kjv
38 8 and judah said unto onan go in unto thy brother s wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brother,bible-kjv
38 12 and in process of time the daughter of shuah judah s wife died and judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to timnath he and his friend hirah the adullamite,bible-kjv
and she said what wilt thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me,bible-kjv
and he gave it her and came in unto her and she conceived by him,bible-kjv
38 22 and he returned to judah and said i cannot find her and also the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place,bible-kjv
38 26 and judah acknowledged them and said she hath been more righteous than i because that i gave her not to shelah my son,bible-kjv
this breach be upon thee therefore his name was called pharez,bible-kjv
39 4 and joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand,bible-kjv
39 8 but he refused and said unto his master s wife behold my master wotteth not what is with me in the house and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand 39 9 there is none greater in this house than i neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee because thou art his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god,bible-kjv
39 16 and she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home,bible-kjv
39 22 and the keeper of the prison committed to joseph s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it,bible-kjv
40 4 and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them and he served them and they continued a season in ward,bible-kjv
and joseph said unto them do not interpretations belong to god,bible-kjv
40 16 when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said unto joseph i also was in my dream and behold i had three white baskets on my head 40 17 and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for pharaoh and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head,bible-kjv
41 1 and it came to pass at the end of two full years that pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river,bible-kjv
41 5 and he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good,bible-kjv
41 9 then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh saying i do remember my faults this day 41 10 pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put me in ward in the captain of the guard s house both me and the chief baker 41 11 and we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream,bible-kjv
41 16 and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is not in me god shall give pharaoh an answer of peace,bible-kjv
41 26 the seven good kine are seven years and the seven good ears are seven years the dream is one,bible-kjv
41 33 now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt,bible-kjv
41 38 and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this is a man in whom the spirit of god is,bible-kjv
41 45 and pharaoh called joseph s name zaphnathpaaneah and he gave him to wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on,bible-kjv
41 48 and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid he up in the same,bible-kjv
41 53 and the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of egypt were ended,bible-kjv
42 1 now when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt jacob said unto his sons why do ye look one upon another,bible-kjv
42 6 and joseph was the governor over the land and he it was that sold to all the people of the land and joseph s brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth,bible-kjv
42 10 and they said unto him nay my lord but to buy food are thy servants come,bible-kjv
42 16 send one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be kept in prison that your words may be proved whether there be any truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye are spies,bible-kjv
42 22 and reuben answered them saying spake i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and ye would not hear,bible-kjv
42 26 and they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence,bible-kjv
42 33 and the man the lord of the country said unto us hereby shall i know that ye are true men leave one of your brethren here with me and take food for the famine of your households and be gone 42 34 and bring your youngest brother unto me then shall i know that ye are no spies but that ye are true men so will i deliver you your brother and ye shall traffick in the land,bible-kjv
43 1 and the famine was sore in the land,bible-kjv
43 7 and they said the man asked us straitly of our state and of our kindred saying is your father yet alive,bible-kjv
43 11 and their father israel said unto them if it must be so now do this take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carry down the man a present a little balm and a little honey spices and myrrh nuts and almonds 43 12 and take double money in your hand and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks carry it again in your hand peradventure it was an oversight 43 13 take also your brother and arise go again unto the man 43 14 and god almighty give you mercy before the man that he may send away your other brother and benjamin,bible-kjv
43 18 and the men were afraid because they were brought into joseph s house and they said because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our asses,bible-kjv
43 24 and the man brought the men into joseph s house and gave them water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender,bible-kjv
43 28 and they answered thy servant our father is in good health he is yet alive,bible-kjv
43 31 and he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and said set on bread,bible-kjv
44 1 and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the men s sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every man s money in his sack s mouth,bible-kjv
44 5 is not this it in which my lord drinketh and whereby indeed he divineth,bible-kjv
44 9 with whomsoever of thy servants it be found both let him die and we also will be my lord s bondmen,bible-kjv
44 14 and judah and his brethren came to joseph s house for he was yet there and they fell before him on the ground,bible-kjv
or how shall we clear ourselves,bible-kjv
44 20 and we said unto my lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loveth him,bible-kjv
44 25 and our father said go again and buy us a little food,bible-kjv
44 33 now therefore i pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren,bible-kjv
45 2 and he wept aloud and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard,bible-kjv
and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt,bible-kjv
45 9 haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto me tarry not 45 10 and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy children s children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast 45 11 and there will i nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty,bible-kjv
45 16 and the fame thereof was heard in pharaoh s house saying joseph s brethren are come and it pleased pharaoh well and his servants,bible-kjv
45 22 to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of raiment,bible-kjv
45 27 and they told him all the words of joseph which he had said unto them and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived 45 28 and israel said it is enough joseph my son is yet alive i will go and see him before i die,bible-kjv
46 5 and jacob rose up from beersheba and the sons of israel carried jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him,bible-kjv
46 11 and the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari,bible-kjv
46 15 these be the sons of leah which she bare unto jacob in padanaram with his daughter dinah all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three,bible-kjv
46 20 and unto joseph in the land of egypt were born manasseh and ephraim which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto him,bible-kjv
46 25 these are the sons of bilhah which laban gave unto rachel his daughter and she bare these unto jacob all the souls were seven,bible-kjv
46 31 and joseph said unto his brethren and unto his father s house i will go up and shew pharaoh and say unto him my brethren and my father s house which were in the land of canaan are come unto me 46 32 and the men are shepherds for their trade hath been to feed cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have,bible-kjv
47 3 and pharaoh said unto his brethren what is your occupation,bible-kjv
47 8 and pharaoh said unto jacob how old art thou,bible-kjv
47 13 and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very sore so that the land of egypt and all the land of canaan fainted by reason of the famine,bible-kjv
47 17 and they brought their cattle unto joseph and joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks and for the cattle of the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year,bible-kjv
47 22 only the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had a portion assigned them of pharaoh and did eat their portion which pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their lands,bible-kjv
47 27 and israel dwelt in the land of egypt in the country of goshen and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied exceedingly,bible-kjv
and he sware unto him,bible-kjv
48 5 and now thy two sons ephraim and manasseh which were born unto thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt are mine as reuben and simeon they shall be mine,bible-kjv
and he said bring them i pray thee unto me and i will bless them,bible-kjv
48 13 and joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward israel s left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israel s right hand and brought them near unto him,bible-kjv
48 19 and his father refused and said i know it my son i know it he also shall become a people and he also shall be great but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nations,bible-kjv
49 2 gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of jacob and hearken unto israel your father,bible-kjv
49 8 judah thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy father s children shall bow down before thee,bible-kjv
49 14 issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens 49 15 and he saw that rest was good and the land that it was pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto tribute,bible-kjv
49 20 out of asher his bread shall be fat and he shall yield royal dainties,bible-kjv
49 29 and he charged them and said unto them i am to be gathered unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of ephron the hittite 49 30 in the cave that is in the field of machpelah which is before mamre in the land of canaan which abraham bought with the field of ephron the hittite for a possession of a buryingplace,bible-kjv
50 2 and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed israel,bible-kjv
50 7 and joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of egypt 50 8 and all the house of joseph and his brethren and his father s house only their little ones and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen,bible-kjv
50 14 and joseph returned into egypt he and his brethren and all that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his father,bible-kjv
50 19 and joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place of god,bible-kjv
50 23 and joseph saw ephraim s children of the third generation the children also of machir the son of manasseh were brought up upon joseph s knees,bible-kjv
1 1 now these are the names of the children of israel which came into egypt every man and his household came with jacob,bible-kjv
1 8 now there arose up a new king over egypt which knew not joseph,bible-kjv
and they were grieved because of the children of israel,bible-kjv
1 19 and the midwives said unto pharaoh because the hebrew women are not as the egyptian women for they are lively and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them,bible-kjv
2 2 and the woman conceived and bare a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months,bible-kjv
and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the hebrews children,bible-kjv
and the women took the child and nursed it,bible-kjv
2 13 and when he went out the second day behold two men of the hebrews strove together and he said to him that did the wrong wherefore smitest thou thy fellow,bible-kjv
but moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of midian and he sat down by a well,bible-kjv
2 20 and he said unto his daughters and where is he,bible-kjv
2 23 and it came to pass in process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage,bible-kjv
3 3 and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt,bible-kjv
and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god,bible-kjv
3 12 and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou hast brought forth the people out of egypt ye shall serve god upon this mountain,bible-kjv
3 16 go and gather the elders of israel together and say unto them the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob appeared unto me saying i have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in egypt 3 17 and i have said i will bring you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey,bible-kjv
3 22 but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour and of her that sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters and ye shall spoil the egyptians,bible-kjv
and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and moses fled from before it,bible-kjv
4 7 and he said put thine hand into thy bosom again,bible-kjv
4 11 and the lord said unto him who hath made man s mouth,bible-kjv
4 14 and the anger of the lord was kindled against moses and he said is not aaron the levite thy brother,bible-kjv
4 17 and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand wherewith thou shalt do signs,bible-kjv
4 21 and the lord said unto moses when thou goest to return into egypt see that thou do all those wonders before pharaoh which i have put in thine hand but i will harden his heart that he shall not let the people go,bible-kjv
4 27 and the lord said to aaron go into the wilderness to meet moses,bible-kjv
5 1 and afterward moses and aaron went in and told pharaoh thus saith the lord god of israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness,bible-kjv
get you unto your burdens,bible-kjv
5 10 and the taskmasters of the people went out and their officers and they spake to the people saying thus saith pharaoh i will not give you straw,bible-kjv
5 15 then the officers of the children of israel came and cried unto pharaoh saying wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants,bible-kjv
5 20 and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from pharaoh 5 21 and they said unto them the lord look upon you and judge because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in their hand to slay us,bible-kjv
6 2 and god spake unto moses and said unto him i am the lord 6 3 and i appeared unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob by the name of god almighty but by my name jehovah was i not known to them,bible-kjv
6 9 and moses spake so unto the children of israel but they hearkened not unto moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage,bible-kjv
6 15 and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman these are the families of simeon,bible-kjv
6 20 and amram took him jochebed his father s sister to wife and she bare him aaron and moses and the years of the life of amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years,bible-kjv
6 25 and eleazar aaron s son took him one of the daughters of putiel to wife and she bare him phinehas these are the heads of the fathers of the levites according to their families,bible-kjv
7 1 and the lord said unto moses see i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet,bible-kjv
7 6 and moses and aaron did as the lord commanded them so did they,bible-kjv
7 12 for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents but aaron s rod swallowed up their rods,bible-kjv
7 17 thus saith the lord in this thou shalt know that i am the lord behold i will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river and they shall be turned to blood,bible-kjv
7 22 and the magicians of egypt did so with their enchantments and pharaoh s heart was hardened neither did he hearken unto them as the lord had said,bible-kjv
8 2 and if thou refuse to let them go behold i will smite all thy borders with frogs 8 3 and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up and come into thine house and into thy bedchamber and upon thy bed and into the house of thy servants and upon thy people and into thine ovens and into thy kneadingtroughs 8 4 and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants,bible-kjv
8 9 and moses said unto pharaoh glory over me when shall i intreat for thee and for thy servants and for thy people to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses that they may remain in the river only,bible-kjv
8 13 and the lord did according to the word of moses and the frogs died out of the houses out of the villages and out of the fields,bible-kjv
8 18 and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice but they could not so there were lice upon man and upon beast,bible-kjv
8 23 and i will put a division between my people and thy people to morrow shall this sign be,bible-kjv
8 28 and pharaoh said i will let you go that ye may sacrifice to the lord your god in the wilderness only ye shall not go very far away intreat for me,bible-kjv
9 1 then the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh and tell him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me,bible-kjv
9 7 and pharaoh sent and behold there was not one of the cattle of the israelites dead,bible-kjv
9 11 and the magicians could not stand before moses because of the boils for the boil was upon the magicians and upon all the egyptians,bible-kjv
9 16 and in very deed for this cause have i raised thee up for to shew in thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth,bible-kjv
9 22 and the lord said unto moses stretch forth thine hand toward heaven that there may be hail in all the land of egypt upon man and upon beast and upon every herb of the field throughout the land of egypt,bible-kjv
9 27 and pharaoh sent and called for moses and aaron and said unto them i have sinned this time the lord is righteous and i and my people are wicked,bible-kjv
9 32 but the wheat and the rie were not smitten for they were not grown up,bible-kjv
10 3 and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh and said unto him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me,bible-kjv
let the men go that they may serve the lord their god knowest thou not yet that egypt is destroyed,bible-kjv
and they were driven out from pharaoh s presence,bible-kjv
10 16 then pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste and he said i have sinned against the lord your god and against you,bible-kjv
10 21 and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand toward heaven that there may be darkness over the land of egypt even darkness which may be felt,bible-kjv

4 31 and this is the charge of their burden according to all their service in the tabernacle of the congregation the boards of the tabernacle and the bars thereof and the pillars thereof and sockets thereof 4 32 and the pillars of the court round about and their sockets and their pins and their cords with all their instruments and with all their service and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden,bible-kjv
4 41 these are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of gershon of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation whom moses and aaron did number according to the commandment of the lord,bible-kjv
5 1 and the lord spake unto moses saying 5 2 command the children of israel that they put out of the camp every leper and every one that hath an issue and whosoever is defiled by the dead 5 3 both male and female shall ye put out without the camp shall ye put them that they defile not their camps in the midst whereof i dwell,bible-kjv
5 10 and every man s hallowed things shall be his whatsoever any man giveth the priest it shall be his,bible-kjv
5 27 and when he hath made her to drink the water then it shall come to pass that if she be defiled and have done trespass against her husband that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter and her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot and the woman shall be a curse among her people,bible-kjv
6 4 all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree from the kernels even to the husk,bible-kjv
6 9 and if any man die very suddenly by him and he hath defiled the head of his consecration then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing on the seventh day shall he shave it,bible-kjv
6 18 and the nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and shall take the hair of the head of his separation and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings,bible-kjv
7 1 and it came to pass on the day that moses had fully set up the tabernacle and had anointed it and sanctified it and all the instruments thereof both the altar and all the vessels thereof and had anointed them and sanctified them 7 2 that the princes of israel heads of the house of their fathers who were the princes of the tribes and were over them that were numbered offered 7 3 and they brought their offering before the lord six covered wagons and twelve oxen a wagon for two of the princes and for each one an ox and they brought them before the tabernacle,bible-kjv
7 10 and the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed even the princes offered their offering before the altar,bible-kjv
7 30 on the fourth day elizur the son of shedeur prince of the children of reuben did offer 7 31 his offering was one silver charger of the weight of an hundred and thirty shekels one silver bowl of seventy shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary both of them full of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering 7 32 one golden spoon of ten shekels full of incense 7 33 one young bullock one ram one lamb of the first year for a burnt offering 7 34 one kid of the goats for a sin offering 7 35 and for a sacrifice of peace offerings two oxen five rams five he goats five lambs of the first year this was the offering of elizur the son of shedeur,bible-kjv

7 87 all the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bullocks the rams twelve the lambs of the first year twelve with their meat offering and the kids of the goats for sin offering twelve,bible-kjv
8 3 and aaron did so he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick as the lord commanded moses,bible-kjv
8 9 and thou shalt bring the levites before the tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of israel together 8 10 and thou shalt bring the levites before the lord and the children of israel shall put their hands upon the levites 8 11 and aaron shall offer the levites before the lord for an offering of the children of israel that they may execute the service of the lord,bible-kjv
8 16 for they are wholly given unto me from among the children of israel instead of such as open every womb even instead of the firstborn of all the children of israel have i taken them unto me,bible-kjv
8 21 and the levites were purified and they washed their clothes and aaron offered them as an offering before the lord and aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them,bible-kjv
9 3 in the fourteenth day of this month at even ye shall keep it in his appointed season according to all the rites of it and according to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keep it,bible-kjv
9 9 and the lord spake unto moses saying 9 10 speak unto the children of israel saying if any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body or be in a journey afar off yet he shall keep the passover unto the lord,bible-kjv
9 15 and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle namely the tent of the testimony and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until the morning,bible-kjv
9 20 and so it was when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle according to the commandment of the lord they abode in their tents and according to the commandment of the lord they journeyed,bible-kjv
10 3 and when they shall blow with them all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,bible-kjv
10 8 and the sons of aaron the priests shall blow with the trumpets and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations,bible-kjv
10 13 and they first took their journey according to the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses,bible-kjv
10 18 and the standard of the camp of reuben set forward according to their armies and over his host was elizur the son of shedeur,bible-kjv
10 23 and over the host of the tribe of the children of manasseh was gamaliel the son of pedahzur,bible-kjv
10 28 thus were the journeyings of the children of israel according to their armies when they set forward,bible-kjv
10 33 and they departed from the mount of the lord three days journey and the ark of the covenant of the lord went before them in the three days journey to search out a resting place for them,bible-kjv
11 2 and the people cried unto moses and when moses prayed unto the lord the fire was quenched,bible-kjv
11 8 and the people went about and gathered it and ground it in mills or beat it in a mortar and baked it in pans and made cakes of it and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil,bible-kjv
11 12 have i conceived all this people,bible-kjv
11 15 and if thou deal thus with me kill me i pray thee out of hand if i have found favour in thy sight and let me not see my wretchedness,bible-kjv
11 19 ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither ten days nor twenty days 11 20 but even a whole month until it come out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you because that ye have despised the lord which is among you and have wept before him saying why came we forth out of egypt,bible-kjv
thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not,bible-kjv
11 28 and joshua the son of nun the servant of moses one of his young men answered and said my lord moses forbid them,bible-kjv
11 32 and the people stood up all that day and all that night and all the next day and they gathered the quails he that gathered least gathered ten homers and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp,bible-kjv
12 2 and they said hath the lord indeed spoken only by moses,bible-kjv
and they three came out,bible-kjv
12 9 and the anger of the lord was kindled against them and he departed,bible-kjv
12 14 and the lord said unto moses if her father had but spit in her face should she not be ashamed seven days,bible-kjv
13 3 and moses by the commandment of the lord sent them from the wilderness of paran all those men were heads of the children of israel,bible-kjv
13 8 of the tribe of ephraim oshea the son of nun,bible-kjv
13 13 of the tribe of asher sethur the son of michael,bible-kjv
13 17 and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said unto them get you up this way southward and go up into the mountain 13 18 and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth therein whether they be strong or weak few or many 13 19 and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and what cities they be that they dwell in whether in tents or in strong holds 13 20 and what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether there be wood therein or not,bible-kjv
now hebron was built seven years before zoan in egypt,bible-kjv
13 27 and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it,bible-kjv
13 32 and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature,bible-kjv
14 3 and wherefore hath the lord brought us unto this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey,bible-kjv
14 8 if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us a land which floweth with milk and honey,bible-kjv
and how long will it be ere they believe me for all the signs which i have shewed among them,bible-kjv
14 19 pardon i beseech thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven this people from egypt even until now,bible-kjv
14 26 and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying 14 27 how long shall i bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me,bible-kjv
14 32 but as for you your carcases they shall fall in this wilderness,bible-kjv
14 38 but joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh which were of the men that went to search the land lived still,bible-kjv
14 42 go not up for the lord is not among you that ye be not smitten before your enemies,bible-kjv
15 5 and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice for one lamb,bible-kjv
15 11 thus shall it be done for one bullock or for one ram or for a lamb or a kid,bible-kjv
15 16 one law and one manner shall be for you and for the stranger that sojourneth with you,bible-kjv
15 25 and the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of israel and it shall be forgiven them for it is ignorance and they shall bring their offering a sacrifice made by fire unto the lord and their sin offering before the lord for their ignorance 15 26 and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of israel and the stranger that sojourneth among them seeing all the people were in ignorance,bible-kjv
15 31 because he hath despised the word of the lord and hath broken his commandment that soul shall utterly be cut off his iniquity shall be upon him,bible-kjv
15 36 and all the congregation brought him without the camp and stoned him with stones and he died as the lord commanded moses,bible-kjv
16 6 this do take you censers korah and all his company 16 7 and put fire therein and put incense in them before the lord to morrow and it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choose he shall be holy ye take too much upon you ye sons of levi,bible-kjv
16 14 moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out the eyes of these men,bible-kjv
16 19 and korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the congregation,bible-kjv
16 26 and he spake unto the congregation saying depart i pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of their s lest ye be consumed in all their sins,bible-kjv
16 31 and it came to pass as he had made an end of speaking all these words that the ground clave asunder that was under them 16 32 and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses and all the men that appertained unto korah and all their goods,bible-kjv
16 38 the censers of these sinners against their own souls let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar for they offered them before the lord therefore they are hallowed and they shall be a sign unto the children of israel,bible-kjv
16 44 and the lord spake unto moses saying 16 45 get you up from among this congregation that i may consume them as in a moment,bible-kjv
16 49 now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred beside them that died about the matter of korah,bible-kjv
17 5 and it shall come to pass that the man s rod whom i shall choose shall blossom and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel whereby they murmur against you,bible-kjv
17 10 and the lord said unto moses bring aaron s rod again before the testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me that they die not,bible-kjv
18 2 and thy brethren also of the tribe of levi the tribe of thy father bring thou with thee that they may be joined unto thee and minister unto thee but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness,bible-kjv
18 7 therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest s office for everything of the altar and within the vail and ye shall serve i have given your priest s office unto you as a service of gift and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death,bible-kjv
18 12 all the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of the wheat the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the lord them have i given thee,bible-kjv
18 17 but the firstling of a cow or the firstling of a sheep or the firstling of a goat thou shalt not redeem they are holy thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire for a sweet savour unto the lord,bible-kjv
18 22 neither must the children of israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation lest they bear sin and die,bible-kjv
18 28 thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the lord of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of israel and ye shall give thereof the lord s heave offering to aaron the priest,bible-kjv
19 1 and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying 19 2 this is the ordinance of the law which the lord hath commanded saying speak unto the children of israel that they bring thee a red heifer without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke 19 3 and ye shall give her unto eleazar the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face 19 4 and eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times 19 5 and one shall burn the heifer in his sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall he burn 19 6 and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer,bible-kjv
19 11 he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days,bible-kjv
19 16 and whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields or a dead body or a bone of a man or a grave shall be unclean seven days,bible-kjv
20 1 then came the children of israel even the whole congregation into the desert of zin in the first month and the people abode in kadesh and miriam died there and was buried there,bible-kjv
it is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates neither is there any water to drink,bible-kjv
20 11 and moses lifted up his hand and with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also,bible-kjv
20 19 and the children of israel said unto him we will go by the high way and if i and my cattle drink of thy water then i will pay for it i will only without doing anything else go through on my feet,bible-kjv
20 23 and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in mount hor by the coast of the land of edom saying 20 24 aaron shall be gathered unto his people for he shall not enter into the land which i have given unto the children of israel because ye rebelled against my word at the water of meribah,bible-kjv
21 1 and when king arad the canaanite which dwelt in the south heard tell that israel came by the way of the spies then he fought against israel and took some of them prisoners,bible-kjv
for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth this light bread,bible-kjv
21 9 and moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived,bible-kjv
21 14 wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the lord what he did in the red sea and in the brooks of arnon 21 15 and at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of ar and lieth upon the border of moab,bible-kjv
21 23 and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border but sihon gathered all his people together and went out against israel into the wilderness and he came to jahaz and fought against israel,bible-kjv
21 29 woe to thee moab,bible-kjv
21 33 and they turned and went up by the way of bashan and og the king of bashan went out against them he and all his people to the battle at edrei,bible-kjv
22 3 and moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many and moab was distressed because of the children of israel,bible-kjv
22 8 and he said unto them lodge here this night and i will bring you word again as the lord shall speak unto me and the princes of moab abode with balaam,bible-kjv
22 14 and the princes of moab rose up and they went unto balak and said balaam refuseth to come with us,bible-kjv
22 20 and god came unto balaam at night and said unto him if the men come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which i shall say unto thee that shalt thou do,bible-kjv
22 24 but the angel of the lord stood in a path of the vineyards a wall being on this side and a wall on that side,bible-kjv
22 29 and balaam said unto the ass because thou hast mocked me i would there were a sword in mine hand for now would i kill thee,bible-kjv
22 32 and the angel of the lord said unto him wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times,bible-kjv
22 36 and when balak heard that balaam was come he went out to meet him unto a city of moab which is in the border of arnon which is in the utmost coast,bible-kjv
the word that god putteth in my mouth that shall i speak,bible-kjv
23 2 and balak did as balaam had spoken and balak and balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram,bible-kjv
23 6 and he returned unto him and lo he stood by his burnt sacrifice he and all the princes of moab,bible-kjv
23 10 who can count the dust of jacob and the number of the fourth part of israel,bible-kjv
23 13 and balak said unto him come i pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not see them all and curse me them from thence,bible-kjv
and balak said unto him what hath the lord spoken,bible-kjv
23 22 god brought them out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn,bible-kjv
23 27 and balak said unto balaam come i pray thee i will bring thee unto another place peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me them from thence,bible-kjv
24 2 and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes and the spirit of god came upon him,bible-kjv
24 9 he couched he lay down as a lion and as a great lion who shall stir him up,bible-kjv
24 14 and now behold i go unto my people come therefore and i will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days,bible-kjv
24 21 and he looked on the kenites and took up his parable and said strong is thy dwellingplace and thou puttest thy nest in a rock,bible-kjv
25 1 and israel abode in shittim and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of moab,bible-kjv
25 6 and behold one of the children of israel came and brought unto his brethren a midianitish woman in the sight of moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of israel who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,bible-kjv
25 12 wherefore say behold i give unto him my covenant of peace 25 13 and he shall have it and his seed after him even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his god and made an atonement for the children of israel,bible-kjv
26 3 and moses and eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho saying 26 4 take the sum of the people from twenty years old and upward as the lord commanded moses and the children of israel which went forth out of the land of egypt,bible-kjv
this is that dathan and abiram which were famous in the congregation who strove against moses and against aaron in the company of korah when they strove against the lord 26 10 and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up together with korah when that company died what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men and they became a sign,bible-kjv

27 5 and moses brought their cause before the lord,bible-kjv
27 11 and if his father have no brethren then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family and he shall possess it and it shall be unto the children of israel a statute of judgment as the lord commanded moses,bible-kjv
27 18 and the lord said unto moses take thee joshua the son of nun a man in whom is the spirit and lay thine hand upon him 27 19 and set him before eleazar the priest and before all the congregation and give him a charge in their sight,bible-kjv

30 8 but if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it then he shall make her vow which she vowed and that which she uttered with her lips wherewith she bound her soul of none effect and the lord shall forgive her,bible-kjv
30 14 but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day then he establisheth all her vows or all her bonds which are upon her he confirmeth them because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them,bible-kjv

31 14 and moses was wroth with the officers of the host with the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds which came from the battle,bible-kjv

31 39 and the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of which the lord s tribute was threescore and one,bible-kjv
31 50 we have therefore brought an oblation for the lord what every man hath gotten of jewels of gold chains and bracelets rings earrings and tablets to make an atonement for our souls before the lord,bible-kjv
32 1 now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a very great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jazer and the land of gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle 32 2 the children of gad and the children of reuben came and spake unto moses and to eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the congregation saying 32 3 ataroth and dibon and jazer and nimrah and heshbon and elealeh and shebam and nebo and beon 32 4 even the country which the lord smote before the congregation of israel is a land for cattle and thy servants have cattle 32 5 wherefore said they if we have found grace in thy sight let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession and bring us not over jordan,bible-kjv
32 10 and the lord s anger was kindled the same time and he sware saying 32 11 surely none of the men that came up out of egypt from twenty years old and upward shall see the land which i sware unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob because they have not wholly followed me 32 12 save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite and joshua the son of nun for they have wholly followed the lord,bible-kjv

30 17 but if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear but shalt be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them 30 18 i denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passest over jordan to go to possess it,bible-kjv
31 4 and the lord shall do unto them as he did to sihon and to og kings of the amorites and unto the land of them whom he destroyed,bible-kjv
31 9 and moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests the sons of levi which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord and unto all the elders of israel,bible-kjv
31 15 and the lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle,bible-kjv
31 20 for when i shall have brought them into the land which i sware unto their fathers that floweth with milk and honey and they shall have eaten and filled themselves and waxen fat then will they turn unto other gods and serve them and provoke me and break my covenant,bible-kjv
31 27 for i know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck behold while i am yet alive with you this day ye have been rebellious against the lord and how much more after my death,bible-kjv
32 2 my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass 32 3 because i will publish the name of the lord ascribe ye greatness unto our god,bible-kjv
hath he not made thee and established thee,bible-kjv
32 11 as an eagle stirreth up her nest fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wings 32 12 so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him,bible-kjv
32 18 of the rock that begat thee thou art unmindful and hast forgotten god that formed thee,bible-kjv
32 23 i will heap mischiefs upon them i will spend mine arrows upon them,bible-kjv
32 29 o that they were wise that they understood this that they would consider their latter end,bible-kjv
32 35 to me belongeth vengeance and recompence their foot shall slide in due time for the day of their calamity is at hand and the things that shall come upon them make haste,bible-kjv
32 40 for i lift up my hand to heaven and say i live for ever,bible-kjv
32 45 and moses made an end of speaking all these words to all israel 32 46 and he said unto them set your hearts unto all the words which i testify among you this day which ye shall command your children to observe to do all the words of this law,bible-kjv
33 2 and he said the lord came from sinai and rose up from seir unto them he shined forth from mount paran and he came with ten thousands of saints from his right hand went a fiery law for them,bible-kjv
33 7 and this is the blessing of judah and he said hear lord the voice of judah and bring him unto his people let his hands be sufficient for him and be thou an help to him from his enemies,bible-kjv
33 13 and of joseph he said blessed of the lord be his land for the precious things of heaven for the dew and for the deep that coucheth beneath 33 14 and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun and for the precious things put forth by the moon 33 15 and for the chief things of the ancient mountains and for the precious things of the lasting hills 33 16 and for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush let the blessing come upon the head of joseph and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren,bible-kjv
33 21 and he provided the first part for himself because there in a portion of the lawgiver was he seated and he came with the heads of the people he executed the justice of the lord and his judgments with israel,bible-kjv
33 26 there is none like unto the god of jeshurun who rideth upon the heaven in thy help and in his excellency on the sky,bible-kjv
34 1 and moses went up from the plains of moab unto the mountain of nebo to the top of pisgah that is over against jericho,bible-kjv
34 7 and moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated,bible-kjv
1 1 now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying 1 2 moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel,bible-kjv
1 7 only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest,bible-kjv
1 12 and to the reubenites and to the gadites and to half the tribe of manasseh spake joshua saying 1 13 remember the word which moses the servant of the lord commanded you saying the lord your god hath given you rest and hath given you this land,bible-kjv
2 1 and joshua the son of nun sent out of shittim two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho,bible-kjv
2 6 but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof,bible-kjv
2 12 now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have shewed you kindness that ye will also shew kindness unto my father s house and give me a true token 2 13 and that ye will save alive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death,bible-kjv
2 17 and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear,bible-kjv
and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the window,bible-kjv
3 4 yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way by which ye must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore,bible-kjv
3 8 and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water of jordan ye shall stand still in jordan,bible-kjv
3 13 and it shall come to pass as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of jordan that the waters of jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon an heap,bible-kjv
4 7 then ye shall answer them that the waters of jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord when it passed over jordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of israel for ever,bible-kjv
4 12 and the children of reuben and the children of gad and half the tribe of manasseh passed over armed before the children of israel as moses spake unto them 4 13 about forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the lord unto battle to the plains of jericho,bible-kjv
4 19 and the people came up out of jordan on the tenth day of the first month and encamped in gilgal in the east border of jericho,bible-kjv
5 1 and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which were on the side of jordan westward and all the kings of the canaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried up the waters of jordan from before the children of israel until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was there spirit in them any more because of the children of israel,bible-kjv
5 6 for the children of israel walked forty years in the wilderness till all the people that were men of war which came out of egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the lord unto whom the lord sware that he would not shew them the land which the lord sware unto their fathers that he would give us a land that floweth with milk and honey,bible-kjv
5 10 and the children of israel encamped in gilgal and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of jericho,bible-kjv
and joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my lord unto his servant,bible-kjv
6 3 and ye shall compass the city all ye men of war and go round about the city once,bible-kjv
6 7 and he said unto the people pass on and compass the city and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the lord,bible-kjv
6 12 and joshua rose early in the morning and the priests took up the ark of the lord,bible-kjv
6 17 and the city shall be accursed even it and all that are therein to the lord only rahab the harlot shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that we sent,bible-kjv
6 22 but joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country go into the harlot s house and bring out thence the woman and all that she hath as ye sware unto her,bible-kjv
6 27 so the lord was with joshua and his fame was noised throughout all the country,bible-kjv
7 4 so there went up thither of the people about three thousand men and they fled before the men of ai,bible-kjv
7 8 o lord what shall i say when israel turneth their backs before their enemies,bible-kjv
7 13 up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourselves against to morrow for thus saith the lord god of israel there is an accursed thing in the midst of thee o israel thou canst not stand before thine enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among you,bible-kjv
7 20 and achan answered joshua and said indeed i have sinned against the lord god of israel and thus and thus have i done 7 21 when i saw among the spoils a goodly babylonish garment and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight then i coveted them and took them and behold they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it,bible-kjv
the lord shall trouble thee this day,bible-kjv
8 1 and the lord said unto joshua fear not neither be thou dismayed take all the people of war with thee and arise go up to ai see i have given into thy hand the king of ai and his people and his city and his land 8 2 and thou shalt do to ai and her king as thou didst unto jericho and her king only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves lay thee an ambush for the city behind it,bible-kjv
see i have commanded you,bible-kjv
8 13 and when they had set the people even all the host that was on the north of the city and their liers in wait on the west of the city joshua went that night into the midst of the valley,bible-kjv
8 18 and the lord said unto joshua stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward ai for i will give it into thine hand,bible-kjv
8 22 and the other issued out of the city against them so they were in the midst of israel some on this side and some on that side and they smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape,bible-kjv
8 27 only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel took for a prey unto themselves according unto the word of the lord which he commanded joshua,bible-kjv
8 33 and all israel and their elders and officers and their judges stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord as well the stranger as he that was born among them half of them over against mount gerizim and half of them over against mount ebal as moses the servant of the lord had commanded before that they should bless the people of israel,bible-kjv
9 6 and they went to joshua unto the camp at gilgal and said unto him and to the men of israel we be come from a far country now therefore make ye a league with us,bible-kjv
9 9 and they said unto him from a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the lord thy god for we have heard the fame of him and all that he did in egypt 9 10 and all that he did to the two kings of the amorites that were beyond jordan to sihon king of heshbon and to og king of bashan which was at ashtaroth,bible-kjv
9 16 and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them that they heard that they were their neighbours and that they dwelt among them,bible-kjv
9 19 but all the princes said unto all the congregation we have sworn unto them by the lord god of israel now therefore we may not touch them,bible-kjv
9 24 and they answered joshua and said because it was certainly told thy servants how that the lord thy god commanded his servant moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you and have done this thing,bible-kjv
10 3 wherefore adonizedec king of jerusalem sent unto hoham king of hebron and unto piram king of jarmuth and unto japhia king of lachish and unto debir king of eglon saying 10 4 come up unto me and help me that we may smite gibeon for it hath made peace with joshua and with the children of israel,bible-kjv
10 9 joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from gilgal all night,bible-kjv
is not this written in the book of jasher,bible-kjv
10 17 and it was told joshua saying the five kings are found hid in a cave at makkedah,bible-kjv
10 23 and they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish and the king of eglon,bible-kjv
10 27 and it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun that joshua commanded and they took them down off the trees and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid and laid great stones in the cave s mouth which remain until this very day,bible-kjv
10 34 and from lachish joshua passed unto eglon and all israel with him and they encamped against it and fought against it 10 35 and they took it on that day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day according to all that he had done to lachish,bible-kjv
10 42 and all these kings and their land did joshua take at one time because the lord god of israel fought for israel,bible-kjv
11 6 and the lord said unto joshua be not afraid because of them for to morrow about this time will i deliver them up all slain before israel thou shalt hough their horses and burn their chariots with fire,bible-kjv
11 11 and they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword utterly destroying them there was not any left to breathe and he burnt hazor with fire,bible-kjv
11 16 so joshua took all that land the hills and all the south country and all the land of goshen and the valley and the plain and the mountain of israel and the valley of the same 11 17 even from the mount halak that goeth up to seir even unto baalgad in the valley of lebanon under mount hermon and all their kings he took and smote them and slew them,bible-kjv
11 22 there was none of the anakims left in the land of the children of israel only in gaza in gath and in ashdod there remained,bible-kjv
12 7 and these are the kings of the country which joshua and the children of israel smote on this side jordan on the west from baalgad in the valley of lebanon even unto the mount halak that goeth up to seir which joshua gave unto the tribes of israel for a possession according to their divisions 12 8 in the mountains and in the valleys and in the plains and in the springs and in the wilderness and in the south country the hittites the amorites and the canaanites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites 12 9 the king of jericho one the king of ai which is beside bethel one 12 10 the king of jerusalem one the king of hebron one 12 11 the king of jarmuth one the king of lachish one 12 12 the king of eglon one the king of gezer one 12 13 the king of debir one the king of geder one 12 14 the king of hormah one the king of arad one 12 15 the king of libnah one the king of adullam one 12 16 the king of makkedah one the king of bethel one 12 17 the king of tappuah one the king of hepher one 12 18 the king of aphek one the king of lasharon one 12 19 the king of madon one the king of hazor one 12 20 the king of shimronmeron one the king of achshaph one 12 21 the king of taanach one the king of megiddo one 12 22 the king of kedesh one the king of jokneam of carmel one 12 23 the king of dor in the coast of dor one the king of the nations of gilgal one 12 24 the king of tirzah one all the kings thirty and one,bible-kjv
13 13 nevertheless the children of israel expelled not the geshurites nor the maachathites but the geshurites and the maachathites dwell among the israelites until this day,bible-kjv
13 23 and the border of the children of reuben was jordan and the border thereof,bible-kjv
13 29 and moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of manasseh and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of manasseh by their families,bible-kjv
14 2 by lot was their inheritance as the lord commanded by the hand of moses for the nine tribes and for the half tribe,bible-kjv
14 7 forty years old was i when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadeshbarnea to espy out the land and i brought him word again as it was in mine heart,bible-kjv
14 12 now therefore give me this mountain whereof the lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the lord will be with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said,bible-kjv
15 1 this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of judah by their families even to the border of edom the wilderness of zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast,bible-kjv
this is the coast of the children of judah round about according to their families,bible-kjv
15 17 and othniel the son of kenaz the brother of caleb took it and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife,bible-kjv
15 21 and the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of judah toward the coast of edom southward were kabzeel and eder and jagur 15 22 and kinah and dimonah and adadah 15 23 and kedesh and hazor and ithnan 15 24 ziph and telem and bealoth 15 25 and hazor hadattah and kerioth and hezron which is hazor 15 26 amam and shema and moladah 15 27 and hazargaddah and heshmon and bethpalet 15 28 and hazarshual and beersheba and bizjothjah 15 29 baalah and iim and azem 15 30 and eltolad and chesil and hormah 15 31 and ziklag and madmannah and sansannah 15 32 and lebaoth and shilhim and ain and rimmon all the cities are twenty and nine with their villages 15 33 and in the valley eshtaol and zoreah and ashnah 15 34 and zanoah and engannim tappuah and enam 15 35 jarmuth and adullam socoh and azekah 15 36 and sharaim and adithaim and gederah and gederothaim fourteen cities with their villages 15 37 zenan and hadashah and migdalgad 15 38 and dilean and mizpeh and joktheel 15 39 lachish and bozkath and eglon 15 40 and cabbon and lahmam and kithlish 15 41 and gederoth bethdagon and naamah and makkedah sixteen cities with their villages 15 42 libnah and ether and ashan 15 43 and jiphtah and ashnah and nezib 15 44 and keilah and achzib and mareshah nine cities with their villages 15 45 ekron with her towns and her villages 15 46 from ekron even unto the sea all that lay near ashdod with their villages 15 47 ashdod with her towns and her villages gaza with her towns and her villages unto the river of egypt and the great sea and the border thereof 15 48 and in the mountains shamir and jattir and socoh 15 49 and dannah and kirjathsannah which is debir 15 50 and anab and eshtemoh and anim 15 51 and goshen and holon and giloh eleven cities with their villages 15 52 arab and dumah and eshean 15 53 and janum and bethtappuah and aphekah 15 54 and humtah and kirjatharba which is hebron and zior nine cities with their villages 15 55 maon carmel and ziph and juttah 15 56 and jezreel and jokdeam and zanoah 15 57 cain gibeah and timnah ten cities with their villages 15 58 halhul bethzur and gedor 15 59 and maarath and bethanoth and eltekon six cities with their villages 15 60 kirjathbaal which is kirjathjearim and rabbah two cities with their villages 15 61 in the wilderness betharabah middin and secacah 15 62 and nibshan and the city of salt and engedi six cities with their villages,bible-kjv
16 8 the border went out from tappuah westward unto the river kanah and the goings out thereof were at the sea,bible-kjv
17 2 there was also a lot for the rest of the children of manasseh by their families for the children of abiezer and for the children of helek and for the children of asriel and for the children of shechem and for the children of hepher and for the children of shemida these were the male children of manasseh the son of joseph by their families,bible-kjv
17 7 and the coast of manasseh was from asher to michmethah that lieth before shechem and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of entappuah,bible-kjv
17 14 and the children of joseph spake unto joshua saying why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit seeing i am a great people forasmuch as the lord hath blessed me hitherto,bible-kjv
and the land was subdued before them,bible-kjv
18 6 ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts and bring the description hither to me that i may cast lots for you here before the lord our god,bible-kjv
18 11 and the lot of the tribe of the children of benjamin came up according to their families and the coast of their lot came forth between the children of judah and the children of joseph,bible-kjv
18 20 and jordan was the border of it on the east side,bible-kjv
19 2 and they had in their inheritance beersheba and sheba and moladah 19 3 and hazarshual and balah and azem 19 4 and eltolad and bethul and hormah 19 5 and ziklag and bethmarcaboth and hazarsusah 19 6 and bethlebaoth and sharuhen thirteen cities and their villages 19 7 ain remmon and ether and ashan four cities and their villages 19 8 and all the villages that were round about these cities to baalathbeer ramath of the south,bible-kjv

19 40 and the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of dan according to their families,bible-kjv
19 51 these are the inheritances which eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of israel divided for an inheritance by lot in shiloh before the lord at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,bible-kjv
20 6 and he shall dwell in that city until he stand before the congregation for judgment and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days then shall the slayer return and come unto his own city and unto his own house unto the city from whence he fled,bible-kjv
21 3 and the children of israel gave unto the levites out of their inheritance at the commandment of the lord these cities and their suburbs,bible-kjv
21 8 and the children of israel gave by lot unto the levites these cities with their suburbs as the lord commanded by the hand of moses,bible-kjv
21 13 thus they gave to the children of aaron the priest hebron with her suburbs to be a city of refuge for the slayer and libnah with her suburbs 21 14 and jattir with her suburbs and eshtemoa with her suburbs 21 15 and holon with her suburbs and debir with her suburbs 21 16 and ain with her suburbs and juttah with her suburbs and bethshemesh with her suburbs nine cities out of those two tribes,bible-kjv

21 44 and the lord gave them rest round about according to all that he sware unto their fathers and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them the lord delivered all their enemies into their hand,bible-kjv
22 6 so joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went unto their tents,bible-kjv
22 11 and the children of israel heard say behold the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh have built an altar over against the land of canaan in the borders of jordan at the passage of the children of israel,bible-kjv
and it will be seeing ye rebel to day against the lord that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of israel,bible-kjv
22 25 for the lord hath made jordan a border between us and you ye children of reuben and children of gad ye have no part in the lord so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the lord,bible-kjv
22 31 and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest said unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the children of manasseh this day we perceive that the lord is among us because ye have not committed this trespass against the lord now ye have delivered the children of israel out of the hand of the lord,bible-kjv
23 2 and joshua called for all israel and for their elders and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and said unto them i am old and stricken in age 23 3 and ye have seen all that the lord your god hath done unto all these nations because of you for the lord your god is he that hath fought for you,bible-kjv
23 10 one man of you shall chase a thousand for the lord your god he it is that fighteth for you as he hath promised you,bible-kjv
23 16 when ye have transgressed the covenant of the lord your god which he commanded you and have gone and served other gods and bowed yourselves to them then shall the anger of the lord be kindled against you and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you,bible-kjv
24 5 i sent moses also and aaron and i plagued egypt according to that which i did among them and afterward i brought you out,bible-kjv
24 11 and you went over jordan and came unto jericho and the men of jericho fought against you the amorites and the perizzites and the canaanites and the hittites and the girgashites the hivites and the jebusites and i delivered them into your hand,bible-kjv
24 16 and the people answered and said god forbid that we should forsake the lord to serve other gods 24 17 for the lord our god he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed 24 18 and the lord drave out from before us all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the land therefore will we also serve the lord for he is our god,bible-kjv
and they said we are witnesses,bible-kjv
24 27 and joshua said unto all the people behold this stone shall be a witness unto us for it hath heard all the words of the lord which he spake unto us it shall be therefore a witness unto you lest ye deny your god,bible-kjv
24 32 and the bones of joseph which the children of israel brought up out of egypt buried they in shechem in a parcel of ground which jacob bought of the sons of hamor the father of shechem for an hundred pieces of silver and it became the inheritance of the children of joseph,bible-kjv
1 3 and judah said unto simeon his brother come up with me into my lot that we may fight against the canaanites and i likewise will go with thee into thy lot,bible-kjv
1 7 and adonibezek said threescore and ten kings having their thumbs and their great toes cut off gathered their meat under my table as i have done so god hath requited me,bible-kjv
1 11 and from thence he went against the inhabitants of debir and the name of debir before was kirjathsepher 1 12 and caleb said he that smiteth kirjathsepher and taketh it to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife,bible-kjv
1 16 and the children of the kenite moses father in law went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of judah into the wilderness of judah which lieth in the south of arad and they went and dwelt among the people,bible-kjv
1 20 and they gave hebron unto caleb as moses said and he expelled thence the three sons of anak,bible-kjv
1 24 and the spies saw a man come forth out of the city and they said unto him shew us we pray thee the entrance into the city and we will shew thee mercy,bible-kjv
1 29 neither did ephraim drive out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer but the canaanites dwelt in gezer among them,bible-kjv
1 36 and the coast of the amorites was from the going up to akrabbim from the rock and upward,bible-kjv
2 5 and they called the name of that place bochim and they sacrificed there unto the lord,bible-kjv
2 10 and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the lord nor yet the works which he had done for israel,bible-kjv
2 16 nevertheless the lord raised up judges which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them,bible-kjv
2 23 therefore the lord left those nations without driving them out hastily neither delivered he them into the hand of joshua,bible-kjv
3 8 therefore the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he sold them into the hand of chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia and the children of israel served chushanrishathaim eight years,bible-kjv
3 12 and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord and the lord strengthened eglon the king of moab against israel because they had done evil in the sight of the lord,bible-kjv
3 17 and he brought the present unto eglon king of moab and eglon was a very fat man,bible-kjv
and ehud said i have a message from god unto thee,bible-kjv
3 25 and they tarried till they were ashamed and behold he opened not the doors of the parlour therefore they took a key and opened them and behold their lord was fallen down dead on the earth,bible-kjv
3 29 and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand men all lusty and all men of valour and there escaped not a man,bible-kjv
4 2 and the lord sold them into the hand of jabin king of canaan that reigned in hazor the captain of whose host was sisera which dwelt in harosheth of the gentiles,bible-kjv
4 7 and i will draw unto thee to the river kishon sisera the captain of jabin s army with his chariots and his multitude and i will deliver him into thine hand,bible-kjv
4 11 now heber the kenite which was of the children of hobab the father in law of moses had severed himself from the kenites and pitched his tent unto the plain of zaanaim which is by kedesh,bible-kjv
4 15 and the lord discomfited sisera and all his chariots and all his host with the edge of the sword before barak so that sisera lighted down off his chariot and fled away on his feet,bible-kjv
4 19 and he said unto her give me i pray thee a little water to drink for i am thirsty,bible-kjv
so he died,bible-kjv
5 1 then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day saying 5 2 praise ye the lord for the avenging of israel when the people willingly offered themselves,bible-kjv
5 7 the inhabitants of the villages ceased they ceased in israel until that i deborah arose that i arose a mother in israel,bible-kjv
5 11 they that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the lord even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in israel then shall the people of the lord go down to the gates,bible-kjv
for the divisions of reuben there were great thoughts of heart,bible-kjv
5 18 zebulun and naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field,bible-kjv
5 22 then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings the pransings of their mighty ones,bible-kjv
5 27 at her feet he bowed he fell he lay down at her feet he bowed he fell where he bowed there he fell down dead,bible-kjv
5 31 so let all thine enemies perish o lord but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might,bible-kjv
6 5 for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy it,bible-kjv
6 13 and gideon said unto him oh my lord if the lord be with us why then is all this befallen us,bible-kjv
behold my family is poor in manasseh and i am the least in my father s house,bible-kjv
6 19 and gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and brought it out unto him under the oak and presented it,bible-kjv
6 22 and when gideon perceived that he was an angel of the lord gideon said alas o lord god,bible-kjv
6 27 then gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the lord had said unto him and so it was because he feared his father s household and the men of the city that he could not do it by day that he did it by night,bible-kjv
6 31 and joash said unto all that stood against him will ye plead for baal,bible-kjv
6 34 but the spirit of the lord came upon gideon and he blew a trumpet and abiezer was gathered after him,bible-kjv
6 40 and god did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only and there was dew on all the ground,bible-kjv
7 4 and the lord said unto gideon the people are yet too many bring them down unto the water and i will try them for thee there and it shall be that of whom i say unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with thee and of whomsoever i say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go,bible-kjv
7 9 and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him arise get thee down unto the host for i have delivered it into thine hand,bible-kjv
7 14 and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel for into his hand hath god delivered midian and all the host,bible-kjv
7 19 so gideon and the hundred men that were with him came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch and they had but newly set the watch and they blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers that were in their hands,bible-kjv
7 24 and gideon sent messengers throughout all mount ephraim saying come down against the midianites and take before them the waters unto bethbarah and jordan,bible-kjv
8 2 and he said unto them what have i done now in comparison of you,bible-kjv
8 5 and he said unto the men of succoth give i pray you loaves of bread unto the people that follow me for they be faint and i am pursuing after zebah and zalmunna kings of midian,bible-kjv
8 10 now zebah and zalmunna were in karkor and their hosts with them about fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword,bible-kjv
8 16 and he took the elders of the city and thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them he taught the men of succoth,bible-kjv
8 20 and he said unto jether his firstborn up and slay them,bible-kjv
8 23 and gideon said unto them i will not rule over you neither shall my son rule over you the lord shall rule over you,bible-kjv
8 26 and the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold beside ornaments and collars and purple raiment that was on the kings of midian and beside the chains that were about their camels necks,bible-kjv
8 30 and gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten for he had many wives,bible-kjv
9 1 and abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem unto his mother s brethren and communed with them and with all the family of the house of his mother s father saying 9 2 speak i pray you in the ears of all the men of shechem whether is better for you either that all the sons of jerubbaal which are threescore and ten persons reign over you or that one reign over you,bible-kjv
9 6 and all the men of shechem gathered together and all the house of millo and went and made abimelech king by the plain of the pillar that was in shechem,bible-kjv
9 11 but the fig tree said unto them should i forsake my sweetness and my good fruit and go to be promoted over the trees,bible-kjv
9 16 now therefore if ye have done truly and sincerely in that ye have made abimelech king and if ye have dealt well with jerubbaal and his house and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands 9 17 for my father fought for you and adventured his life far and delivered you out of the hand of midian 9 18 and ye are risen up against my father s house this day and have slain his sons threescore and ten persons upon one stone and have made abimelech the son of his maidservant king over the men of shechem because he is your brother 9 19 if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with jerubbaal and with his house this day then rejoice ye in abimelech and let him also rejoice in you 9 20 but if not let fire come out from abimelech and devour the men of shechem and the house of millo and let fire come out from the men of shechem and from the house of millo and devour abimelech,bible-kjv
9 27 and they went out into the fields and gathered their vineyards and trode the grapes and made merry and went into the house of their god and did eat and drink and cursed abimelech,bible-kjv
9 29 and would to god this people were under my hand,bible-kjv
9 32 now therefore up by night thou and the people that is with thee and lie in wait in the field 9 33 and it shall be that in the morning as soon as the sun is up thou shalt rise early and set upon the city and behold when he and the people that is with him come out against thee then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion,bible-kjv
9 37 and gaal spake again and said see there come people down by the middle of the land and another company come along by the plain of meonenim,bible-kjv
9 40 and abimelech chased him and he fled before him and many were overthrown and wounded even unto the entering of the gate,bible-kjv
9 45 and abimelech fought against the city all that day and he took the city and slew the people that was therein and beat down the city and sowed it with salt,bible-kjv
9 50 then went abimelech to thebez and encamped against thebez and took it,bible-kjv
and his young man thrust him through and he died,bible-kjv
10 3 and after him arose jair a gileadite and judged israel twenty and two years,bible-kjv
10 8 and that year they vexed and oppressed the children of israel eighteen years all the children of israel that were on the other side jordan in the land of the amorites which is in gilead,bible-kjv
10 13 yet ye have forsaken me and served other gods wherefore i will deliver you no more,bible-kjv
and the children of israel assembled themselves together and encamped in mizpeh,bible-kjv
11 3 then jephthah fled from his brethren and dwelt in the land of tob and there were gathered vain men to jephthah and went out with him,bible-kjv
11 8 and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah therefore we turn again to thee now that thou mayest go with us and fight against the children of ammon and be our head over all the inhabitants of gilead,bible-kjv
11 13 and the king of the children of ammon answered unto the messengers of jephthah because israel took away my land when they came up out of egypt from arnon even unto jabbok and unto jordan now therefore restore those lands again peaceably,bible-kjv
11 20 but sihon trusted not israel to pass through his coast but sihon gathered all his people together and pitched in jahaz and fought against israel,bible-kjv
so whomsoever the lord our god shall drive out from before us them will we possess,bible-kjv
11 28 howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearkened not unto the words of jephthah which he sent him,bible-kjv
thus the children of ammon were subdued before the children of israel,bible-kjv
11 37 and she said unto her father let this thing be done for me let me alone two months that i may go up and down upon the mountains and bewail my virginity i and my fellows,bible-kjv
12 1 and the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and went northward and said unto jephthah wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of ammon and didst not call us to go with thee,bible-kjv
12 5 and the gileadites took the passages of jordan before the ephraimites and it was so that when those ephraimites which were escaped said let me go over that the men of gilead said unto him art thou an ephraimite,bible-kjv
12 8 and after him ibzan of bethlehem judged israel,bible-kjv
12 12 and elon the zebulonite died and was buried in aijalon in the country of zebulun,bible-kjv
13 2 and there was a certain man of zorah of the family of the danites whose name was manoah and his wife was barren and bare not,bible-kjv
13 9 and god hearkened to the voice of manoah and the angel of god came again unto the woman as she sat in the field but manoah her husband was not with her,bible-kjv
how shall we order the child and how shall we do unto him,bible-kjv
for manoah knew not that he was an angel of the lord,bible-kjv
and manoah and his wife looked on it and fell on their faces to the ground,bible-kjv
13 24 and the woman bare a son and called his name samson and the child grew and the lord blessed him,bible-kjv
and samson said unto his father get her for me for she pleaseth me well,bible-kjv
14 8 and after a time he returned to take her and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion and behold there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion,bible-kjv
and they said unto him put forth thy riddle that we may hear it,bible-kjv
14 16 and samson s wife wept before him and said thou dost but hate me and lovest me not thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people and hast not told it me,bible-kjv
and he said unto them if ye had not plowed with my heifer ye had not found out my riddle,bible-kjv
but her father would not suffer him to go in,bible-kjv
15 5 and when he had set the brands on fire he let them go into the standing corn of the philistines and burnt up both the shocks and also the standing corn with the vineyards and olives,bible-kjv
15 8 and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock etam,bible-kjv
what is this that thou hast done unto us,bible-kjv
and they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from the rock,bible-kjv
15 18 and he was sore athirst and called on the lord and said thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant and now shall i die for thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised,bible-kjv
and they compassed him in and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city and were quiet all the night saying in the morning when it is day we shall kill him,bible-kjv
16 7 and samson said unto her if they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried then shall i be weak and be as another man,bible-kjv
so his strength was not known,bible-kjv
and he brake them from off his arms like a thread,bible-kjv
16 15 and she said unto him how canst thou say i love thee when thine heart is not with me,bible-kjv
16 19 and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him,bible-kjv
16 22 howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven,bible-kjv
16 26 and samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer me that i may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that i may lean upon them,bible-kjv
and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were therein,bible-kjv
17 2 and he said unto his mother the eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee about which thou cursedst and spakest of also in mine ears behold the silver is with me i took it,bible-kjv
17 6 in those days there was no king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes,bible-kjv
17 10 and micah said unto him dwell with me and be unto me a father and a priest and i will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year and a suit of apparel and thy victuals,bible-kjv
18 1 in those days there was no king in israel and in those days the tribe of the danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of israel,bible-kjv
18 4 and he said unto them thus and thus dealeth micah with me and hath hired me and i am his priest,bible-kjv
18 9 and they said arise that we may go up against them for we have seen the land and behold it is very good and are ye still,bible-kjv
18 13 and they passed thence unto mount ephraim and came unto the house of micah,bible-kjv
18 17 and the five men that went to spy out the land went up and came in thither and took the graven image and the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war,bible-kjv
18 21 so they turned and departed and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them,bible-kjv
and what is this that ye say unto me what aileth thee,bible-kjv
and they built a city and dwelt therein,bible-kjv
19 2 and his concubine played the whore against him and went away from him unto her father s house to bethlehemjudah and was there four whole months,bible-kjv
19 7 and when the man rose up to depart his father in law urged him therefore he lodged there again,bible-kjv
19 11 and when they were by jebus the day was far spent and the servant said unto his master come i pray thee and let us turn in into this city of the jebusites and lodge in it,bible-kjv
19 16 and behold there came an old man from his work out of the field at even which was also of mount ephraim and he sojourned in gibeah but the men of the place were benjamites,bible-kjv
19 20 and the old man said peace be with thee howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me only lodge not in the street,bible-kjv
19 25 but the men would not hearken to him so the man took his concubine and brought her forth unto them and they knew her and abused her all the night until the morning and when the day began to spring they let her go,bible-kjv
then the man took her up upon an ass and the man rose up and gat him unto his place,bible-kjv
20 3 now the children of benjamin heard that the children of israel were gone up to mizpeh,bible-kjv
20 7 behold ye are all children of israel give here your advice and counsel,bible-kjv
20 13 now therefore deliver us the men the children of belial which are in gibeah that we may put them to death and put away evil from israel,bible-kjv
20 17 and the men of israel beside benjamin were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword all these were men of war,bible-kjv
20 21 and the children of benjamin came forth out of gibeah and destroyed down to the ground of the israelites that day twenty and two thousand men,bible-kjv
20 25 and benjamin went forth against them out of gibeah the second day and destroyed down to the ground of the children of israel again eighteen thousand men all these drew the sword,bible-kjv
20 30 and the children of israel went up against the children of benjamin on the third day and put themselves in array against gibeah as at other times,bible-kjv
20 34 and there came against gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all israel and the battle was sore but they knew not that evil was near them,bible-kjv
20 39 and when the men of israel retired in the battle benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of israel about thirty persons for they said surely they are smitten down before us as in the first battle,bible-kjv
20 44 and there fell of benjamin eighteen thousand men all these were men of valour,bible-kjv
21 1 now the men of israel had sworn in mizpeh saying there shall not any of us give his daughter unto benjamin to wife,bible-kjv
21 6 and the children of israel repented them for benjamin their brother and said there is one tribe cut off from israel this day,bible-kjv
21 10 and the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest and commanded them saying go and smite the inhabitants of jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword with the women and the children,bible-kjv
21 15 and the people repented them for benjamin because that the lord had made a breach in the tribes of israel,bible-kjv
21 20 therefore they commanded the children of benjamin saying go and lie in wait in the vineyards 21 21 and see and behold if the daughters of shiloh come out to dance in dances then come ye out of the vineyards and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of shiloh and go to the land of benjamin,bible-kjv
the book of ruth,bible-kjv
1 3 and elimelech naomi s husband died and she was left and her two sons,bible-kjv
1 8 and naomi said unto her two daughters in law go return each to her mother s house the lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me,bible-kjv
are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands,bible-kjv
1 14 and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpah kissed her mother in law but ruth clave unto her,bible-kjv
and it came to pass when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this naomi,bible-kjv
2 2 and ruth the moabitess said unto naomi let me now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight i shall find grace,bible-kjv
2 5 then said boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers whose damsel is this,bible-kjv
2 10 then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have i found grace in thine eyes that thou shouldest take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger,bible-kjv
and she sat beside the reapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left,bible-kjv
and where wroughtest thou,bible-kjv
2 21 and ruth the moabitess said he said unto me also thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest,bible-kjv
behold he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor,bible-kjv
3 7 and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down,bible-kjv
3 11 and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman,bible-kjv
3 15 also he said bring the vail that thou hast upon thee and hold it,bible-kjv
3 18 then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day,bible-kjv
and they sat down,bible-kjv
4 6 and the kinsman said i cannot redeem it for myself lest i mar mine own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for i cannot redeem it,bible-kjv
4 10 moreover ruth the moabitess the wife of mahlon have i purchased to be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place ye are witnesses this day,bible-kjv
4 15 and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age for thy daughter in law which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven sons hath born him,bible-kjv
otherwise called,bible-kjv
1 4 and when the time was that elkanah offered he gave to peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions 1 5 but unto hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved hannah but the lord had shut up her womb,bible-kjv
and why is thy heart grieved,bible-kjv
1 11 and she vowed a vow and said o lord of hosts if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and not forget thine handmaid but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child then i will give him unto the lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head,bible-kjv
1 15 and hannah answered and said no my lord i am a woman of a sorrowful spirit i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the lord,bible-kjv
1 19 and they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the lord and returned and came to their house to ramah and elkanah knew hannah his wife and the lord remembered her,bible-kjv
so the woman abode and gave her son suck until she weaned him,bible-kjv
and he worshipped the lord there,bible-kjv
2 5 they that were full have hired out themselves for bread and they that were hungry ceased so that the barren hath born seven and she that hath many children is waxed feeble,bible-kjv
2 10 the adversaries of the lord shall be broken to pieces out of heaven shall he thunder upon them the lord shall judge the ends of the earth and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt the horn of his anointed,bible-kjv
so they did in shiloh unto all the israelites that came thither,bible-kjv
2 19 moreover his mother made him a little coat and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice,bible-kjv
2 22 now eli was very old and heard all that his sons did unto all israel and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,bible-kjv
notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father because the lord would slay them,bible-kjv
2 29 wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering which i have commanded in my habitation and honourest thy sons above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of israel my people,bible-kjv
2 34 and this shall be a sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two sons on hophni and phinehas in one day they shall die both of them,bible-kjv
3 2 and it came to pass at that time when eli was laid down in his place and his eyes began to wax dim that he could not see 3 3 and ere the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord where the ark of god was and samuel was laid down to sleep 3 4 that the lord called samuel and he answered here am i,bible-kjv
and samuel arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me,bible-kjv
and eli perceived that the lord had called the child,bible-kjv
3 11 and the lord said to samuel behold i will do a thing in israel at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle,bible-kjv
and samuel feared to shew eli the vision,bible-kjv
3 18 and samuel told him every whit and hid nothing from him,bible-kjv
4 1 and the word of samuel came to all israel,bible-kjv
4 4 so the people sent to shiloh that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the lord of hosts which dwelleth between the cherubims and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were there with the ark of the covenant of god,bible-kjv
and they said woe unto us,bible-kjv
4 9 be strong and quit yourselves like men o ye philistines that ye be not servants unto the hebrews as they have been to you quit yourselves like men and fight,bible-kjv
and when the man came into the city and told it all the city cried out,bible-kjv
and he said what is there done my son,bible-kjv
4 20 and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her fear not for thou hast born a son,bible-kjv
5 2 when the philistines took the ark of god they brought it into the house of dagon and set it by dagon,bible-kjv
5 6 but the hand of the lord was heavy upon them of ashdod and he destroyed them and smote them with emerods even ashdod and the coasts thereof,bible-kjv
5 9 and it was so that after they had carried it about the hand of the lord was against the city with a very great destruction and he smote the men of the city both small and great and they had emerods in their secret parts,bible-kjv
6 1 and the ark of the lord was in the country of the philistines seven months,bible-kjv
they answered five golden emerods and five golden mice according to the number of the lords of the philistines for one plague was on you all and on your lords,bible-kjv
6 9 and see if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to bethshemesh then he hath done us this great evil but if not then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us it was a chance that happened to us,bible-kjv
6 15 and the levites took down the ark of the lord and the coffer that was with it wherein the jewels of gold were and put them on the great stone and the men of bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the lord,bible-kjv
and to whom shall he go up from us,bible-kjv
7 4 then the children of israel did put away baalim and ashtaroth and served the lord only,bible-kjv
and when the children of israel heard it they were afraid of the philistines,bible-kjv
7 12 then samuel took a stone and set it between mizpeh and shen and called the name of it ebenezer saying hitherto hath the lord helped us,bible-kjv
7 16 and he went from year to year in circuit to bethel and gilgal and mizpeh and judged israel in all those places,bible-kjv
8 4 then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together and came to samuel unto ramah 8 5 and said unto him behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations,bible-kjv
8 9 now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them,bible-kjv
8 14 and he will take your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servants,bible-kjv
8 19 nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us 8 20 that we also may be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles,bible-kjv
9 2 and he had a son whose name was saul a choice young man and a goodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodlier person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people,bible-kjv
9 6 and he said unto him behold now there is in this city a man of god and he is an honourable man all that he saith cometh surely to pass now let us go thither peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go,bible-kjv
9 10 then said saul to his servant well said come let us go,bible-kjv
9 14 and they went up into the city and when they were come into the city behold samuel came out against them for to go up to the high place,bible-kjv
9 19 and samuel answered saul and said i am the seer go up before me unto the high place for ye shall eat with me to day and to morrow i will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heart,bible-kjv
and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of benjamin,bible-kjv
and samuel said behold that which is left,bible-kjv
and saul arose and they went out both of them he and samuel abroad,bible-kjv
10 5 after that thou shalt come to the hill of god where is the garrison of the philistines and it shall come to pass when thou art come thither to the city that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a tabret and a pipe and a harp before them and they shall prophesy 10 6 and the spirit of the lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another man,bible-kjv
10 11 and it came to pass when all that knew him beforetime saw that behold he prophesied among the prophets then the people said one to another what is this that is come unto the son of kish,bible-kjv
10 14 and saul s uncle said unto him and to his servant whither went ye,bible-kjv
10 17 and samuel called the people together unto the lord to mizpeh 10 18 and said unto the children of israel thus saith the lord god of israel i brought up israel out of egypt and delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all kingdoms and of them that oppressed you 10 19 and ye have this day rejected your god who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations and ye have said unto him nay but set a king over us,bible-kjv
and the lord answered behold he hath hid himself among the stuff,bible-kjv
and samuel sent all the people away every man to his house,bible-kjv
11 1 then nahash the ammonite came up and encamped against jabeshgilead and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash make a covenant with us and we will serve thee,bible-kjv
and they told him the tidings of the men of jabesh,bible-kjv
11 9 and they said unto the messengers that came thus shall ye say unto the men of jabeshgilead to morrow by that time the sun be hot ye shall have help,bible-kjv
bring the men that we may put them to death,bible-kjv
12 2 and now behold the king walketh before you and i am old and grayheaded and behold my sons are with you and i have walked before you from my childhood unto this day,bible-kjv
or of whose hand have i received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith,bible-kjv
12 6 and samuel said unto the people it is the lord that advanced moses and aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of egypt,bible-kjv
12 11 and the lord sent jerubbaal and bedan and jephthah and samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side and ye dwelled safe,bible-kjv
12 16 now therefore stand and see this great thing which the lord will do before your eyes,bible-kjv
12 20 and samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all this wickedness yet turn not aside from following the lord but serve the lord with all your heart 12 21 and turn ye not aside for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain,bible-kjv
13 3 and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistines that was in geba and the philistines heard of it,bible-kjv
13 6 when the men of israel saw that they were in a strait for the people were distressed then the people did hide themselves in caves and in thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pits,bible-kjv
and he offered the burnt offering,bible-kjv
13 14 but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people because thou hast not kept that which the lord commanded thee,bible-kjv
13 19 now there was no smith found throughout all the land of israel for the philistines said lest the hebrews make them swords or spears 13 20 but all the israelites went down to the philistines to sharpen every man his share and his coulter and his axe and his mattock,bible-kjv
but he told not his father,bible-kjv
14 6 and jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the lord to save by many or by few,bible-kjv
14 11 and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the philistines and the philistines said behold the hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves,bible-kjv
14 15 and there was trembling in the host in the field and among all the people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and the earth quaked so it was a very great trembling,bible-kjv
for the ark of god was at that time with the children of israel,bible-kjv
14 23 so the lord saved israel that day and the battle passed over unto bethaven,bible-kjv
14 27 but jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in an honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his eyes were enlightened,bible-kjv
for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the philistines,bible-kjv
14 34 and saul said disperse yourselves among the people and say unto them bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep and slay them here and eat and sin not against the lord in eating with the blood,bible-kjv
then said the priest let us draw near hither unto god,bible-kjv
14 39 for as the lord liveth which saveth israel though it be in jonathan my son he shall surely die,bible-kjv
and saul and jonathan were taken but the people escaped,bible-kjv
14 44 and saul answered god do so and more also for thou shalt surely die jonathan,bible-kjv
14 47 so saul took the kingdom over israel and fought against all his enemies on every side against moab and against the children of ammon and against edom and against the kings of zobah and against the philistines and whithersoever he turned himself he vexed them,bible-kjv
15 1 samuel also said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over israel now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the lord,bible-kjv
15 6 and saul said unto the kenites go depart get you down from among the amalekites lest i destroy you with them for ye shewed kindness to all the children of israel when they came up out of egypt,bible-kjv
15 10 then came the word of the lord unto samuel saying 15 11 it repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he is turned back from following me and hath not performed my commandments,bible-kjv
15 15 and saul said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed,bible-kjv
15 19 wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the lord but didst fly upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the lord,bible-kjv
15 23 for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry,bible-kjv
15 27 and as samuel turned about to go away he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle and it rent,bible-kjv
15 32 then said samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of the amalekites,bible-kjv
15 34 then samuel went to ramah and saul went up to his house to gibeah of saul,bible-kjv
if saul hear it he will kill me,bible-kjv
16 5 and he said peaceably i am come to sacrifice unto the lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice,bible-kjv
and he said neither hath the lord chosen this,bible-kjv
16 11 and samuel said unto jesse are here all thy children,bible-kjv
and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he,bible-kjv
16 16 let our lord now command thy servants which are before thee to seek out a man who is a cunning player on an harp and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well,bible-kjv
16 21 and david came to saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his armourbearer,bible-kjv
17 3 and the philistines stood on a mountain on the one side and israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them,bible-kjv
17 8 and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel and said unto them why are ye come out to set your battle in array,bible-kjv
17 11 when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid,bible-kjv
17 16 and the philistine drew near morning and evening and presented himself forty days,bible-kjv
17 22 and david left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his brethren,bible-kjv
17 26 and david spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the reproach from israel,bible-kjv
i know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle,bible-kjv
17 32 and david said to saul let no man s heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine,bible-kjv
and saul said unto david go and the lord be with thee,bible-kjv
17 40 and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd s bag which he had even in a scrip and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the philistine,bible-kjv
17 44 and the philistine said to david come to me and i will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field,bible-kjv
17 49 and david put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone and slang it and smote the philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth,bible-kjv
and the wounded of the philistines fell down by the way to shaaraim even unto gath and unto ekron,bible-kjv
17 56 and the king said enquire thou whose son the stripling is,bible-kjv
18 2 and saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his father s house,bible-kjv
18 7 and the women answered one another as they played and said saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands,bible-kjv
and david avoided out of his presence twice,bible-kjv
18 16 but all israel and judah loved david because he went out and came in before them,bible-kjv
18 19 but it came to pass at the time when merab saul s daughter should have been given to david that she was given unto adriel the meholathite to wife,bible-kjv
18 23 and saul s servants spake those words in the ears of david,bible-kjv
18 26 and when his servants told david these words it pleased david well to be the king s son in law and the days were not expired,bible-kjv
18 30 then the princes of the philistines went forth and it came to pass after they went forth that david behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of saul so that his name was much set by,bible-kjv
19 7 and jonathan called david and jonathan shewed him all those things,bible-kjv
19 11 saul also sent messengers unto david s house to watch him and to slay him in the morning and michal david s wife told him saying if thou save not thy life to night to morrow thou shalt be slain,bible-kjv
19 16 and when the messengers were come in behold there was an image in the bed with a pillow of goats hair for his bolster,bible-kjv
19 19 and it was told saul saying behold david is at naioth in ramah,bible-kjv
and one said behold they be at naioth in ramah,bible-kjv
what is mine iniquity,bible-kjv
20 4 then said jonathan unto david whatsoever thy soul desireth i will even do it for thee,bible-kjv
20 9 and jonathan said far be it from thee for if i knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee then would not i tell it thee,bible-kjv
20 12 and jonathan said unto david o lord god of israel when i have sounded my father about to morrow any time or the third day and behold if there be good toward david and i then send not unto thee and shew it thee 20 13 the lord do so and much more to jonathan but if it please my father to do thee evil then i will shew it thee and send thee away that thou mayest go in peace and the lord be with thee as he hath been with my father,bible-kjv
20 19 and when thou hast stayed three days then thou shalt go down quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand and shalt remain by the stone ezel,bible-kjv
20 23 and as touching the matter which thou and i have spoken of behold the lord be between thee and me for ever,bible-kjv
20 28 and jonathan answered saul david earnestly asked leave of me to go to bethlehem 20 29 and he said let me go i pray thee for our family hath a sacrifice in the city and my brother he hath commanded me to be there and now if i have found favour in thine eyes let me get away i pray thee and see my brethren,bible-kjv
20 32 and jonathan answered saul his father and said unto him wherefore shall he be slain,bible-kjv
20 36 and he said unto his lad run find out now the arrows which i shoot,bible-kjv
20 39 but the lad knew not any thing only jonathan and david knew the matter,bible-kjv
21 1 then came david to nob to ahimelech the priest and ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of david and said unto him why art thou alone and no man with thee,bible-kjv
21 5 and david answered the priest and said unto him of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days since i came out and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in a manner common yea though it were sanctified this day in the vessel,bible-kjv
21 9 and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of elah behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if thou wilt take that take it for there is no other save that here,bible-kjv
21 12 and david laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid of achish the king of gath,bible-kjv
22 1 david therefore departed thence and escaped to the cave adullam and when his brethren and all his father s house heard it they went down thither to him,bible-kjv
then david departed and came into the forest of hareth,bible-kjv
22 12 and saul said hear now thou son of ahitub,bible-kjv
be it far from me let not the king impute any thing unto his servant nor to all the house of my father for thy servant knew nothing of all this less or more,bible-kjv
and doeg the edomite turned and he fell upon the priests and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod,bible-kjv
22 23 abide thou with me fear not for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life but with me thou shalt be in safeguard,bible-kjv
23 4 then david enquired of the lord yet again,bible-kjv
23 7 and it was told saul that david was come to keilah,bible-kjv
23 11 will the men of keilah deliver me up into his hand,bible-kjv
and the lord said they will deliver thee up,bible-kjv
23 15 and david saw that saul was come out to seek his life and david was in the wilderness of ziph in a wood,bible-kjv
23 20 now therefore o king come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down and our part shall be to deliver him into the king s hand,bible-kjv
23 25 saul also and his men went to seek him,bible-kjv
23 28 wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david and went against the philistines therefore they called that place selahammahlekoth,bible-kjv
24 4 and the men of david said unto him behold the day of which the lord said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thine hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee,bible-kjv
but saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way,bible-kjv
24 11 moreover my father see yea see the skirt of thy robe in my hand for in that i cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand and i have not sinned against thee yet thou huntest my soul to take it,bible-kjv
after a dead dog after a flea,bible-kjv
24 18 and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me forasmuch as when the lord had delivered me into thine hand thou killedst me not,bible-kjv
24 22 and david sware unto saul,bible-kjv
25 3 now the name of the man was nabal and the name of his wife abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and he was of the house of caleb,bible-kjv
wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes for we come in a good day give i pray thee whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants and to thy son david,bible-kjv
25 11 shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i have killed for my shearers and give it unto men whom i know not whence they be,bible-kjv
25 15 but the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt neither missed we any thing as long as we were conversant with them when we were in the fields 25 16 they were a wall unto us both by night and day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep,bible-kjv
25 20 and it was so as she rode on the ass that she came down by the covert on the hill and behold david and his men came down against her and she met them,bible-kjv
25 26 now therefore my lord as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth seeing the lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thine enemies and they that seek evil to my lord be as nabal,bible-kjv
25 32 and david said to abigail blessed be the lord god of israel which sent thee this day to meet me 25 33 and blessed be thy advice and blessed be thou which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with mine own hand,bible-kjv
25 38 and it came to pass about ten days after that the lord smote nabal that he died,bible-kjv
25 42 and abigail hasted and arose and rode upon an ass with five damsels of hers that went after her and she went after the messengers of david and became his wife,bible-kjv
26 3 and saul pitched in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon by the way,bible-kjv
and abishai said i will go down with thee,bible-kjv
26 11 the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against the lord s anointed but i pray thee take thou now the spear that is at his bolster and the cruse of water and let us go,bible-kjv
and who is like to thee in israel,bible-kjv
and now see where the king s spear is and the cruse of water that was at his bolster,bible-kjv
or what evil is in mine hand,bible-kjv
26 22 and david answered and said behold the king s spear,bible-kjv
so david went on his way and saul returned to his place,bible-kjv
27 5 and david said unto achish if i have now found grace in thine eyes let them give me a place in some town in the country that i may dwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee,bible-kjv
27 10 and achish said whither have ye made a road to day,bible-kjv
and achish said unto david know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with me to battle thou and thy men,bible-kjv
28 4 and the philistines gathered themselves together and came and pitched in shunem and saul gathered all israel together and they pitched in gilboa,bible-kjv
28 8 and saul disguised himself and put on other raiment and he went and two men with him and they came to the woman by night and he said i pray thee divine unto me by the familiar spirit and bring me him up whom i shall name unto thee,bible-kjv
28 12 and when the woman saw samuel she cried with a loud voice and the woman spake to saul saying why hast thou deceived me,bible-kjv
and she said an old man cometh up and he is covered with a mantle,bible-kjv
28 17 and the lord hath done to him as he spake by me for the lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand and given it to thy neighbour even to david 28 18 because thou obeyedst not the voice of the lord nor executedst his fierce wrath upon amalek therefore hath the lord done this thing unto thee this day,bible-kjv
28 23 but he refused and said i will not eat,bible-kjv
29 1 now the philistines gathered together all their armies to aphek and the israelites pitched by a fountain which is in jezreel,bible-kjv
should it not be with the heads of these men,bible-kjv
and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as i have been with thee unto this day that i may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king,bible-kjv
30 1 and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south and ziklag and smitten ziklag and burned it with fire 30 2 and had taken the women captives that were therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way,bible-kjv
30 7 and david said to abiathar the priest ahimelech s son i pray thee bring me hither the ephod,bible-kjv
30 9 so david went he and the six hundred men that were with him and came to the brook besor where those that were left behind stayed,bible-kjv
and he said i am a young man of egypt servant to an amalekite and my master left me because three days agone i fell sick,bible-kjv
30 17 and david smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day and there escaped not a man of them save four hundred young men which rode upon camels and fled,bible-kjv
30 22 then answered all the wicked men and men of belial of those that went with david and said because they went not with us we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered save to every man his wife and his children that they may lead them away and depart,bible-kjv
30 26 and when david came to ziklag he sent of the spoil unto the elders of judah even to his friends saying behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the lord 30 27 to them which were in bethel and to them which were in south ramoth and to them which were in jattir 30 28 and to them which were in aroer and to them which were in siphmoth and to them which were in eshtemoa 30 29 and to them which were in rachal and to them which were in the cities of the jerahmeelites and to them which were in the cities of the kenites 30 30 and to them which were in hormah and to them which were in chorashan and to them which were in athach 30 31 and to them which were in hebron and to all the places where david himself and his men were wont to haunt,bible-kjv
but his armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid,bible-kjv
31 8 and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to strip the slain that they found saul and his three sons fallen in mount gilboa,bible-kjv
the second book of samuel,bible-kjv
and he said unto him out of the camp of israel am i escaped,bible-kjv
1 6 and the young man that told him said as i happened by chance upon mount gilboa behold saul leaned upon his spear and lo the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him,bible-kjv
1 9 he said unto me again stand i pray thee upon me and slay me for anguish is come upon me because my life is yet whole in me,bible-kjv
1 14 and david said unto him how wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the lord s anointed,bible-kjv
1 19 the beauty of israel is slain upon thy high places how are the mighty fallen,bible-kjv
1 24 ye daughters of israel weep over saul who clothed you in scarlet with other delights who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel,bible-kjv
2 1 and it came to pass after this that david enquired of the lord saying shall i go up into any of the cities of judah,bible-kjv
2 3 and his men that were with him did david bring up every man with his household and they dwelt in the cities of hebron,bible-kjv
2 7 therefore now let your hands be strengthened and be ye valiant for your master saul is dead and also the house of judah have anointed me king over them,bible-kjv
2 12 and abner the son of ner and the servants of ishbosheth the son of saul went out from mahanaim to gibeon,bible-kjv
2 16 and they caught every one his fellow by the head and thrust his sword in his fellow s side so they fell down together wherefore that place was called helkathhazzurim which is in gibeon,bible-kjv
and he answered i am,bible-kjv
2 23 howbeit he refused to turn aside wherefore abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib that the spear came out behind him and he fell down there and died in the same place and it came to pass that as many as came to the place where asahel fell down and died stood still,bible-kjv
how long shall it be then ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren,bible-kjv
2 31 but the servants of david had smitten of benjamin and of abner s men so that three hundred and threescore men died,bible-kjv
these were born to david in hebron,bible-kjv
3 11 and he could not answer abner a word again because he feared him,bible-kjv
3 15 and ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband even from phaltiel the son of laish,bible-kjv
3 19 and abner also spake in the ears of benjamin and abner went also to speak in the ears of david in hebron all that seemed good to israel and that seemed good to the whole house of benjamin,bible-kjv
3 22 and behold the servants of david and joab came from pursuing a troop and brought in a great spoil with them but abner was not with david in hebron for he had sent him away and he was gone in peace,bible-kjv
3 26 and when joab was come out from david he sent messengers after abner which brought him again from the well of sirah but david knew it not,bible-kjv
and king david himself followed the bier,bible-kjv
3 35 and when all the people came to cause david to eat meat while it was yet day david sware saying so do god to me and more also if i taste bread or ought else till the sun be down,bible-kjv
4 1 and when saul s son heard that abner was dead in hebron his hands were feeble and all the israelites were troubled,bible-kjv
and his name was mephibosheth,bible-kjv
4 9 and david answered rechab and baanah his brother the sons of rimmon the beerothite and said unto them as the lord liveth who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity 4 10 when one told me saying behold saul is dead thinking to have brought good tidings i took hold of him and slew him in ziklag who thought that i would have given him a reward for his tidings 4 11 how much more when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed,bible-kjv
5 2 also in time past when saul was king over us thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord said to thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel,bible-kjv
5 7 nevertheless david took the strong hold of zion the same is the city of david,bible-kjv
5 10 and david went on and grew great and the lord god of hosts was with him,bible-kjv
5 17 but when the philistines heard that they had anointed david king over israel all the philistines came up to seek david and david heard of it and went down to the hold,bible-kjv
5 20 and david came to baalperazim and david smote them there and said the lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me as the breach of waters,bible-kjv
5 24 and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt bestir thyself for then shall the lord go out before thee to smite the host of the philistines,bible-kjv
6 4 and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was at gibeah accompanying the ark of god and ahio went before the ark,bible-kjv
6 9 and david was afraid of the lord that day and said how shall the ark of the lord come to me,bible-kjv
6 13 and it was so that when they that bare the ark of the lord had gone six paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings,bible-kjv
6 18 and as soon as david had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord of hosts,bible-kjv
6 21 and david said unto michal it was before the lord which chose me before thy father and before all his house to appoint me ruler over the people of the lord over israel therefore will i play before the lord,bible-kjv
7 4 and it came to pass that night that the word of the lord came unto nathan saying 7 5 go and tell my servant david thus saith the lord shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in,bible-kjv
also the lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house,bible-kjv
7 16 and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee thy throne shall be established for ever,bible-kjv
and is this the manner of man o lord god,bible-kjv
7 23 and what one nation in the earth is like thy people even like israel whom god went to redeem for a people to himself and to make him a name and to do for you great things and terrible for thy land before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from egypt from the nations and their gods,bible-kjv
7 28 and now o lord god thou art that god and thy words be true and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant 7 29 therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may continue for ever before thee for thou o lord god hast spoken it and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever,bible-kjv
8 4 and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and david houghed all the chariot horses but reserved of them for an hundred chariots,bible-kjv
8 8 and from betah and from berothai cities of hadadezer king david took exceeding much brass,bible-kjv
and the lord preserved david whithersoever he went,bible-kjv
and when they had called him unto david the king said unto him art thou ziba,bible-kjv
and ziba said unto the king behold he is in the house of machir the son of ammiel in lodebar,bible-kjv
9 7 and david said unto him fear not for i will surely shew thee kindness for jonathan thy father s sake and will restore thee all the land of saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually,bible-kjv
9 11 then said ziba unto the king according to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant so shall thy servant do,bible-kjv
10 1 and it came to pass after this that the king of the children of ammon died and hanun his son reigned in his stead,bible-kjv
hath not david rather sent his servants unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it,bible-kjv
10 8 and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate and the syrians of zoba and of rehob and ishtob and maacah were by themselves in the field,bible-kjv
10 14 and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled then fled they also before abishai and entered into the city,bible-kjv
and the syrians set themselves in array against david and fought with him,bible-kjv
but david tarried still at jerusalem,bible-kjv
11 5 and the woman conceived and sent and told david and said i am with child,bible-kjv
and uriah departed out of the king s house and there followed him a mess of meat from the king,bible-kjv
as thou livest and as thy soul liveth i will not do this thing,bible-kjv
11 15 and he wrote in the letter saying set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may be smitten and die,bible-kjv
11 21 who smote abimelech the son of jerubbesheth,bible-kjv
11 23 and the messenger said unto david surely the men prevailed against us and came out unto us into the field and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate,bible-kjv
but the thing that david had done displeased the lord,bible-kjv
12 5 and david s anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to nathan as the lord liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely die 12 6 and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity,bible-kjv
12 10 now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou hast despised me and hast taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife,bible-kjv
12 14 howbeit because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die,bible-kjv
12 18 and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died,bible-kjv
12 21 then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou hast done,bible-kjv
i shall go to him but he shall not return to me,bible-kjv
12 28 now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it lest i take the city and it be called after my name,bible-kjv
so david and all the people returned unto jerusalem,bible-kjv
wilt thou not tell me,bible-kjv
13 8 so tamar went to her brother amnon s house and he was laid down,bible-kjv
13 10 and amnon said unto tamar bring the meat into the chamber that i may eat of thine hand,bible-kjv
and as for thee thou shalt be as one of the fools in israel,bible-kjv
13 16 and she said unto him there is no cause this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me,bible-kjv
13 19 and tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on crying,bible-kjv
13 22 and absalom spake unto his brother amnon neither good nor bad for absalom hated amnon because he had forced his sister tamar,bible-kjv
13 26 then said absalom if not i pray thee let my brother amnon go with us,bible-kjv
13 29 and the servants of absalom did unto amnon as absalom had commanded,bible-kjv
13 33 now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart to think that all the king s sons are dead for amnon only is dead,bible-kjv
13 37 but absalom fled and went to talmai the son of ammihud king of geshur,bible-kjv
14 2 and joab sent to tekoah and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her i pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put on now mourning apparel and anoint not thyself with oil but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead 14 3 and come to the king and speak on this manner unto him,bible-kjv
14 6 and thy handmaid had two sons and they two strove together in the field and there was none to part them but the one smote the other and slew him,bible-kjv
14 11 then said she i pray thee let the king remember the lord thy god that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more lest they destroy my son,bible-kjv
for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished,bible-kjv
14 18 then the king answered and said unto the woman hide not from me i pray thee the thing that i shall ask thee,bible-kjv
14 22 and joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself and thanked the king and joab said to day thy servant knoweth that i have found grace in thy sight my lord o king in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant,bible-kjv
14 26 and when he polled his head for it was at every year s end that he polled it because the hair was heavy on him therefore he polled it he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king s weight,bible-kjv
and absalom s servants set the field on fire,bible-kjv
15 1 and it came to pass after this that absalom prepared him chariots and horses and fifty men to run before him,bible-kjv
15 5 and it was so that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him,bible-kjv
so he arose and went to hebron,bible-kjv
15 13 and there came a messenger to david saying the hearts of the men of israel are after absalom,bible-kjv
15 17 and the king went forth and all the people after him and tarried in a place that was far off,bible-kjv
seeing i go whither i may return thou and take back thy brethren mercy and truth be with thee,bible-kjv
15 24 and lo zadok also and all the levites were with him bearing the ark of the covenant of god and they set down the ark of god and abiathar went up until all the people had done passing out of the city,bible-kjv
15 29 zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god again to jerusalem and they tarried there,bible-kjv
15 35 and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the priests,bible-kjv
16 2 and the king said unto ziba what meanest thou by these,bible-kjv
and ziba said i humbly beseech thee that i may find grace in thy sight my lord o king,bible-kjv
let me go over i pray thee and take off his head,bible-kjv
let him alone and let him curse for the lord hath bidden him,bible-kjv
16 16 and it came to pass when hushai the archite david s friend was come unto absalom that hushai said unto absalom god save the king god save the king,bible-kjv
should i not serve in the presence of his son,bible-kjv
16 23 and the counsel of ahithophel which he counselled in those days was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of god so was all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom,bible-kjv
if not speak thou,bible-kjv
17 11 therefore i counsel that all israel be generally gathered unto thee from dan even to beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for multitude and that thou go to battle in thine own person,bible-kjv
17 15 then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priests thus and thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elders of israel and thus and thus have i counselled,bible-kjv
17 20 and when absalom s servants came to the woman to the house they said where is ahimaaz and jonathan,bible-kjv
17 23 and when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed he saddled his ass and arose and gat him home to his house to his city and put his household in order and hanged himself and died and was buried in the sepulchre of his father,bible-kjv
17 27 and it came to pass when david was come to mahanaim that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim 17 28 brought beds and basons and earthen vessels and wheat and barley and flour and parched corn and beans and lentiles and parched pulse 17 29 and honey and butter and sheep and cheese of kine for david and for the people that were with him to eat for they said the people is hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness,bible-kjv
18 4 and the king said unto them what seemeth you best i will do,bible-kjv
18 8 for the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured,bible-kjv
and i would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle,bible-kjv
18 15 and ten young men that bare joab s armour compassed about and smote absalom and slew him,bible-kjv
18 20 and joab said unto him thou shalt not bear tidings this day but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear no tidings because the king s son is dead,bible-kjv
18 23 but howsoever said he let me run,bible-kjv
and the king said if he be alone there is tidings in his mouth,bible-kjv
and the king said he is a good man and cometh with good tidings,bible-kjv
18 30 and the king said unto him turn aside and stand here,bible-kjv
18 33 and the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said o my son absalom my son my son absalom,bible-kjv
19 4 but the king covered his face and the king cried with a loud voice o my son absalom o absalom my son my son,bible-kjv
and they told unto all the people saying behold the king doth sit in the gate,bible-kjv
19 11 and king david sent to zadok and to abiathar the priests saying speak unto the elders of judah saying why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house,bible-kjv
19 14 and he bowed the heart of all the men of judah even as the heart of one man so that they sent this word unto the king return thou and all thy servants,bible-kjv
19 18 and there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king s household and to do what he thought good,bible-kjv
shall there any man be put to death this day in israel,bible-kjv
19 25 and it came to pass when he was come to jerusalem to meet the king that the king said unto him wherefore wentest not thou with me mephibosheth,bible-kjv
19 29 and the king said unto him why speakest thou any more of thy matters,bible-kjv
19 33 and the king said unto barzillai come thou over with me and i will feed thee with me in jerusalem,bible-kjv
wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king,bible-kjv
19 39 and all the people went over jordan,bible-kjv
have we eaten at all of the king s cost,bible-kjv
20 2 so every man of israel went up from after david and followed sheba the son of bichri but the men of judah clave unto their king from jordan even to jerusalem,bible-kjv
20 6 and david said to abishai now shall sheba the son of bichri do us more harm than did absalom take thou thy lord s servants and pursue after him lest he get him fenced cities and escape us,bible-kjv
and joab took amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him,bible-kjv
and when the man saw that all the people stood still he removed amasa out of the highway into the field and cast a cloth upon him when he saw that every one that came by him stood still,bible-kjv
20 17 and when he was come near unto her the woman said art thou joab,bible-kjv
20 19 i am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in israel thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in israel why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the lord,bible-kjv
and they cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri and cast it out to joab,bible-kjv
and the lord answered it is for saul and for his bloody house because he slew the gibeonites,bible-kjv
and he said what ye shall say that will i do for you,bible-kjv
21 10 and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night,bible-kjv
21 15 moreover the philistines had yet war again with israel and david went down and his servants with him and fought against the philistines and david waxed faint,bible-kjv
21 19 and there was again a battle in gob with the philistines where elhanan the son of jaareoregim a bethlehemite slew the brother of goliath the gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weaver s beam,bible-kjv
22 4 i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies,bible-kjv
22 11 and he rode upon a cherub and did fly and he was seen upon the wings of the wind,bible-kjv
22 16 and the channels of the sea appeared the foundations of the world were discovered at the rebuking of the lord at the blast of the breath of his nostrils,bible-kjv
22 22 for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly departed from my god,bible-kjv
22 27 with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury,bible-kjv
22 32 for who is god save the lord,bible-kjv
22 36 thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy gentleness hath made me great,bible-kjv
22 41 thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that i might destroy them that hate me,bible-kjv
22 46 strangers shall fade away and they shall be afraid out of their close places,bible-kjv
22 51 he is the tower of salvation for his king and sheweth mercy to his anointed unto david and to his seed for evermore,bible-kjv
23 5 although my house be not so with god yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure for this is all my salvation and all my desire although he make it not to grow,bible-kjv
and the philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a piece of ground full of lentiles and the people fled from the philistines,bible-kjv
23 16 and the three mighty men brake through the host of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the lord,bible-kjv
and he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them and had the name among three,bible-kjv
23 23 he was more honourable than the thirty but he attained not to the first three,bible-kjv
24 3 and joab said unto the king now the lord thy god add unto the people how many soever they be an hundredfold and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing,bible-kjv
24 9 and joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king and there were in israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword and the men of judah were five hundred thousand men,bible-kjv
or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies while they pursue thee,bible-kjv
24 16 and when the angel stretched out his hand upon jerusalem to destroy it the lord repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed the people it is enough stay now thine hand,bible-kjv
24 19 and david according to the saying of gad went up as the lord commanded,bible-kjv
24 23 all these things did araunah as a king give unto the king,bible-kjv
so the lord was intreated for the land and the plague was stayed from israel,bible-kjv
1 2 wherefore his servants said unto him let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin and let her stand before the king and let her cherish him and let her lie in thy bosom that my lord the king may get heat,bible-kjv
and he also was a very goodly man and his mother bare him after absalom,bible-kjv
1 12 now therefore come let me i pray thee give thee counsel that thou mayest save thine own life and the life of thy son solomon,bible-kjv
1 16 and bathsheba bowed and did obeisance unto the king,bible-kjv
1 21 otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers that i and my son solomon shall be counted offenders,bible-kjv
1 25 for he is gone down this day and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the king s sons and the captains of the host and abiathar the priest and behold they eat and drink before him and say god save king adonijah,bible-kjv
1 29 and the king sware and said as the lord liveth that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress 1 30 even as i sware unto thee by the lord god of israel saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even so will i certainly do this day,bible-kjv
1 35 then ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon my throne for he shall be king in my stead and i have appointed him to be ruler over israel and over judah,bible-kjv
and they blew the trumpet and all the people said god save king solomon,bible-kjv
1 43 and jonathan answered and said to adonijah verily our lord king david hath made solomon king,bible-kjv
and the king bowed himself upon the bed,bible-kjv
1 52 and solomon said if he will shew himself a worthy man there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall be found in him he shall die,bible-kjv
2 6 do therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace,bible-kjv
2 11 and the days that david reigned over israel were forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem,bible-kjv
2 14 he said moreover i have somewhat to say unto thee,bible-kjv
2 17 and he said speak i pray thee unto solomon the king for he will not say thee nay that he give me abishag the shunammite to wife,bible-kjv
and the king said unto her ask on my mother for i will not say thee nay,bible-kjv
2 24 now therefore as the lord liveth which hath established me and set me on the throne of david my father and who hath made me an house as he promised adonijah shall be put to death this day,bible-kjv
and joab fled unto the tabernacle of the lord and caught hold on the horns of the altar,bible-kjv
and benaiah brought the king word again saying thus said joab and thus he answered me,bible-kjv
2 35 and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over the host and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar,bible-kjv
2 39 and it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the servants of shimei ran away unto achish son of maachah king of gath,bible-kjv
and thou saidst unto me the word that i have heard is good,bible-kjv
3 1 and solomon made affinity with pharaoh king of egypt and took pharaoh s daughter and brought her into the city of david until he had made an end of building his own house and the house of the lord and the wall of jerusalem round about,bible-kjv
3 6 and solomon said thou hast shewed unto thy servant david my father great mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou hast kept for him this great kindness that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day,bible-kjv
3 11 and god said unto him because thou hast asked this thing and hast not asked for thyself long life neither hast asked riches for thyself nor hast asked the life of thine enemies but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment 3 12 behold i have done according to thy words lo i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee,bible-kjv
3 16 then came there two women that were harlots unto the king and stood before him,bible-kjv
3 21 and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it was dead but when i had considered it in the morning behold it was not my son which i did bear,bible-kjv
3 24 and the king said bring me a sword,bible-kjv
3 27 then the king answered and said give her the living child and in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof,bible-kjv
4 7 and solomon had twelve officers over all israel which provided victuals for the king and his household each man his month in a year made provision,bible-kjv
4 24 for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river from tiphsah even to azzah over all the kings on this side the river and he had peace on all sides round about him,bible-kjv
4 29 and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the sea shore,bible-kjv
4 34 and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon from all kings of the earth which had heard of his wisdom,bible-kjv
5 6 now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of lebanon and my servants shall be with thy servants and unto thee will i give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the sidonians,bible-kjv
5 11 and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household and twenty measures of pure oil thus gave solomon to hiram year by year,bible-kjv
5 17 and the king commanded and they brought great stones costly stones and hewed stones to lay the foundation of the house,bible-kjv
6 4 and for the house he made windows of narrow lights,bible-kjv
6 10 and then he built chambers against all the house five cubits high and they rested on the house with timber of cedar,bible-kjv
6 17 and the house that is the temple before it was forty cubits long,bible-kjv
6 22 and the whole house he overlaid with gold until he had finished all the house also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold,bible-kjv
6 27 and he set the cherubims within the inner house and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims so that the wing of the one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house,bible-kjv
6 32 the two doors also were of olive tree and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and overlaid them with gold and spread gold upon the cherubims and upon the palm trees,bible-kjv
6 37 in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the lord laid in the month zif 6 38 and in the eleventh year in the month bul which is the eighth month was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it,bible-kjv
7 4 and there were windows in three rows and light was against light in three ranks,bible-kjv
solomon made also an house for pharaoh s daughter whom he had taken to wife like unto this porch,bible-kjv
7 13 and king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tyre,bible-kjv
7 18 and he made the pillars and two rows round about upon the one network to cover the chapiters that were upon the top with pomegranates and so did he for the other chapiter,bible-kjv
7 23 and he made a molten sea ten cubits from the one brim to the other it was round all about and his height was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about,bible-kjv
7 28 and the work of the bases was on this manner they had borders and the borders were between the ledges 7 29 and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions oxen and cherubims and upon the ledges there was a base above and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work,bible-kjv
7 34 and there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base and the undersetters were of the very base itself,bible-kjv
7 39 and he put five bases on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south,bible-kjv
7 48 and solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the lord the altar of gold and the table of gold whereupon the shewbread was 7 49 and the candlesticks of pure gold five on the right side and five on the left before the oracle with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold 7 50 and the bowls and the snuffers and the basons and the spoons and the censers of pure gold and the hinges of gold both for the doors of the inner house the most holy place and for the doors of the house to wit of the temple,bible-kjv
8 3 and all the elders of israel came and the priests took up the ark,bible-kjv
8 8 and they drew out the staves that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle and they were not seen without and there they are unto this day,bible-kjv
8 14 and the king turned his face about and blessed all the congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood 8 15 and he said blessed be the lord god of israel which spake with his mouth unto david my father and hath with his hand fulfilled it saying 8 16 since the day that i brought forth my people israel out of egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build an house that my name might be therein but i chose david to be over my people israel,bible-kjv
8 21 and i have set there a place for the ark wherein is the covenant of the lord which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of egypt,bible-kjv
behold the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that i have builded,bible-kjv
8 35 when heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee if they pray toward this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou afflictest them 8 36 then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people israel that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk and give rain upon thy land which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance,bible-kjv
8 53 for thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth to be thine inheritance as thou spakest by the hand of moses thy servant when thou broughtest our fathers out of egypt o lord god,bible-kjv
8 61 let your heart therefore be perfect with the lord our god to walk in his statutes and to keep his commandments as at this day,bible-kjv
8 65 and at that time solomon held a feast and all israel with him a great congregation from the entering in of hamath unto the river of egypt before the lord our god seven days and seven days even fourteen days,bible-kjv
9 6 but if ye shall at all turn from following me ye or your children and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which i have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them 9 7 then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them and this house which i have hallowed for my name will i cast out of my sight and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people 9 8 and at this house which is high every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say why hath the lord done thus unto this land and to this house,bible-kjv
and he called them the land of cabul unto this day,bible-kjv
9 20 and all the people that were left of the amorites hittites perizzites hivites and jebusites which were not of the children of israel 9 21 their children that were left after them in the land whom the children of israel also were not able utterly to destroy upon those did solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day,bible-kjv
so he finished the house,bible-kjv
10 2 and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bare spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart,bible-kjv
10 8 happy are thy men happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom,bible-kjv
10 13 and king solomon gave unto the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which solomon gave her of his royal bounty,bible-kjv
10 18 moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the best gold,bible-kjv
10 23 so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom,bible-kjv
10 28 and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn the king s merchants received the linen yarn at a price,bible-kjv
11 5 for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites,bible-kjv
11 11 wherefore the lord said unto solomon forasmuch as this is done of thee and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which i have commanded thee i will surely rend the kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant,bible-kjv
11 18 and they arose out of midian and came to paran and they took men with them out of paran and they came to egypt unto pharaoh king of egypt which gave him an house and appointed him victuals and gave him land,bible-kjv
and he answered nothing howbeit let me go in any wise,bible-kjv
11 28 and the man jeroboam was a mighty man of valour and solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of joseph,bible-kjv
11 38 and it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command thee and wilt walk in my ways and do that is right in my sight to keep my statutes and my commandments as david my servant did that i will be with thee and build thee a sure house as i built for david and will give israel unto thee,bible-kjv
11 42 and the time that solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel was forty years,bible-kjv
12 5 and he said unto them depart yet for three days then come again to me,bible-kjv
12 10 and the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee saying thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto us thus shalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my father s loins,bible-kjv
12 16 so when all israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david,bible-kjv
therefore king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem,bible-kjv
they hearkened therefore to the word of the lord and returned to depart according to the word of the lord,bible-kjv
12 30 and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto dan,bible-kjv
13 1 and behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word of the lord unto bethel and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense,bible-kjv
13 5 the altar also was rent and the ashes poured out from the altar according to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of the lord,bible-kjv
13 10 so he went another way and returned not by the way that he came to bethel,bible-kjv
so they saddled him the ass and he rode thereon 13 14 and went after the man of god and found him sitting under an oak and he said unto him art thou the man of god that camest from judah,bible-kjv
but he lied unto him,bible-kjv
13 25 and behold men passed by and saw the carcase cast in the way and the lion standing by the carcase and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt,bible-kjv
13 29 and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of god and laid it upon the ass and brought it back and the old prophet came to the city to mourn and to bury him,bible-kjv
14 1 at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick,bible-kjv
14 5 and the lord said unto ahijah behold the wife of jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son for he is sick thus and thus shalt thou say unto her for it shall be when she cometh in that she shall feign herself to be another woman,bible-kjv
14 12 arise thou therefore get thee to thine own house and when thy feet enter into the city the child shall die,bible-kjv
14 16 and he shall give israel up because of the sins of jeroboam who did sin and who made israel to sin,bible-kjv
rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord did choose out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there,bible-kjv
14 25 and it came to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam that shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem 14 26 and he took away the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king s house he even took away all and he took away all the shields of gold which solomon had made,bible-kjv
14 31 and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david,bible-kjv
and his mother s name was maachah the daughter of abishalom,bible-kjv
and there was war between abijam and jeroboam,bible-kjv
15 11 and asa did that which was right in the eyes of the lord as did david his father,bible-kjv
15 16 and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days,bible-kjv
15 22 then king asa made a proclamation throughout all judah none was exempted and they took away the stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha had builded and king asa built with them geba of benjamin and mizpah,bible-kjv
15 26 and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of his father and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin,bible-kjv
15 32 and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days,bible-kjv
16 5 now the rest of the acts of baasha and what he did and his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel,bible-kjv
16 10 and zimri went in and smote him and killed him in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah and reigned in his stead,bible-kjv
16 15 in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah did zimri reign seven days in tirzah,bible-kjv
16 19 for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the lord in walking in the way of jeroboam and in his sin which he did to make israel to sin,bible-kjv
16 24 and he bought the hill samaria of shemer for two talents of silver and built on the hill and called the name of the city which he built after the name of shemer owner of the hill samaria,bible-kjv
16 29 and in the thirty and eighth year of asa king of judah began ahab the son of omri to reign over israel and ahab the son of omri reigned over israel in samaria twenty and two years,bible-kjv
16 34 in his days did hiel the bethelite build jericho he laid the foundation thereof in abiram his firstborn and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son segub according to the word of the lord which he spake by joshua the son of nun,bible-kjv
17 6 and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook,bible-kjv
17 11 and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand,bible-kjv
17 16 and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah,bible-kjv
and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he abode and laid him upon his own bed,bible-kjv
17 24 and the woman said to elijah now by this i know that thou art a man of god and that the word of the lord in thy mouth is truth,bible-kjv
now obadiah feared the lord greatly 18 4 for it was so when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord that obadiah took an hundred prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water,bible-kjv
18 9 and he said what have i sinned that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of ahab to slay me,bible-kjv
18 14 and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and he shall slay me,bible-kjv
18 19 now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mount carmel and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty and the prophets of the groves four hundred which eat at jezebel s table,bible-kjv
18 22 then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord but baal s prophets are four hundred and fifty men,bible-kjv
but there was no voice nor any that answered,bible-kjv
18 30 and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me,bible-kjv
18 34 and he said do it the second time,bible-kjv
18 36 and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word,bible-kjv
and they took them and elijah brought them down to the brook kishon and slew them there,bible-kjv
and he said go again seven times,bible-kjv
18 46 and the hand of the lord was on elijah and he girded up his loins and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel,bible-kjv
19 5 and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat,bible-kjv
19 9 and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou here elijah,bible-kjv
and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou here elijah,bible-kjv
19 19 so he departed thence and found elisha the son of shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he with the twelfth and elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him,bible-kjv
20 1 and benhadad the king of syria gathered all his host together and there were thirty and two kings with him and horses and chariots and he went up and besieged samaria and warred against it,bible-kjv
20 8 and all the elders and all the people said unto him hearken not unto him nor consent,bible-kjv
20 12 and it came to pass when ben hadad heard this message as he was drinking he and the kings in the pavilions that he said unto his servants set yourselves in array,bible-kjv
and he said thus saith the lord even by the young men of the princes of the provinces,bible-kjv
but benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kings that helped him,bible-kjv
20 21 and the king of israel went out and smote the horses and chariots and slew the syrians with a great slaughter,bible-kjv
20 26 and it came to pass at the return of the year that benhadad numbered the syrians and went up to aphek to fight against israel,bible-kjv
20 30 but the rest fled to aphek into the city and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left,bible-kjv
he is my brother,bible-kjv
then said ahab i will send thee away with this covenant,bible-kjv
and as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and slew him,bible-kjv
20 40 and as thy servant was busy here and there he was gone,bible-kjv
21 1 and it came to pass after these things that naboth the jezreelite had a vineyard which was in jezreel hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria,bible-kjv
21 5 but jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread,bible-kjv
21 9 and she wrote in the letters saying proclaim a fast and set naboth on high among the people 21 10 and set two men sons of belial before him to bear witness against him saying thou didst blaspheme god and the king,bible-kjv
then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him with stones that he died,bible-kjv
21 19 and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord hast thou killed and also taken possession,bible-kjv
21 23 and of jezebel also spake the lord saying the dogs shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel,bible-kjv
21 28 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying 21 29 seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before me,bible-kjv
22 4 and he said unto jehoshaphat wilt thou go with me to battle to ramothgilead,bible-kjv
22 7 and jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we might enquire of him,bible-kjv
22 11 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and he said thus saith the lord with these shalt thou push the syrians until thou have consumed them,bible-kjv
and the king said unto him micaiah shall we go against ramothgilead to battle or shall we forbear,bible-kjv
22 19 and he said hear thou therefore the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left,bible-kjv
and he said i will go forth and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets,bible-kjv
22 26 and the king of israel said take micaiah and carry him back unto amon the governor of the city and to joash the king s son 22 27 and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i come in peace,bible-kjv
and the king of israel disguised himself and went into the battle,bible-kjv
22 34 and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot turn thine hand and carry me out of the host for i am wounded,bible-kjv
22 39 now the rest of the acts of ahab and all that he did and the ivory house which he made and all the cities that he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel,bible-kjv
22 43 and he walked in all the ways of asa his father he turned not aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of the lord nevertheless the high places were not taken away for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places,bible-kjv
22 48 jehoshaphat made ships of tharshish to go to ophir for gold but they went not for the ships were broken at eziongeber,bible-kjv
22 52 and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin 22 53 for he served baal and worshipped him and provoked to anger the lord god of israel according to all that his father had done,bible-kjv
1 2 and ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in samaria and was sick and he sent messengers and said unto them go enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron whether i shall recover of this disease,bible-kjv
1 6 and they said unto him there came a man up to meet us and said unto us go turn again unto the king that sent you and say unto him thus saith the lord is it not because there is not a god in israel that thou sendest to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron,bible-kjv
1 9 then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty,bible-kjv
1 11 again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty,bible-kjv
and the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before elijah and besought him and said unto him o man of god i pray thee let my life and the life of these fifty thy servants be precious in thy sight,bible-kjv
therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die,bible-kjv
2 2 and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to bethel,bible-kjv
2 4 and elijah said unto him elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to jericho,bible-kjv
2 6 and elijah said unto him tarry i pray thee here for the lord hath sent me to jordan,bible-kjv
2 9 and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee,bible-kjv
and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces,bible-kjv
2 16 and they said unto him behold now there be with thy servants fifty strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thy master lest peradventure the spirit of the lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley,bible-kjv
2 19 and the men of the city said unto elisha behold i pray thee the situation of this city is pleasant as my lord seeth but the water is naught and the ground barren,bible-kjv
2 23 and he went up from thence unto bethel and as he was going up by the way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him and said unto him go up thou bald head go up thou bald head,bible-kjv
3 2 and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord but not like his father and like his mother for he put away the image of baal that his father had made,bible-kjv
3 7 and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah saying the king of moab hath rebelled against me wilt thou go with me against moab to battle,bible-kjv
3 10 and the king of israel said alas,bible-kjv
so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him,bible-kjv
3 15 but now bring me a minstrel,bible-kjv
3 19 and ye shall smite every fenced city and every choice city and shall fell every good tree and stop all wells of water and mar every good piece of land with stones,bible-kjv
3 25 and they beat down the cities and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone and filled it and they stopped all the wells of water and felled all the good trees only in kirharaseth left they the stones thereof howbeit the slingers went about it and smote it,bible-kjv
4 2 and elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee,bible-kjv
4 5 so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out,bible-kjv
and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy children of the rest,bible-kjv
4 11 and it fell on a day that he came thither and he turned into the chamber and lay there,bible-kjv
and she answered i dwell among mine own people,bible-kjv
4 16 and he said about this season according to the time of life thou shalt embrace a son,bible-kjv
and he said to a lad carry him to his mother,bible-kjv
it is neither new moon nor sabbath,bible-kjv
is it well with thy husband,bible-kjv
did i not say do not deceive me,bible-kjv
wherefore he went again to meet him and told him saying the child is not awaked,bible-kjv
4 36 and he called gehazi and said call this shunammite,bible-kjv
4 39 and one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full and came and shred them into the pot of pottage for they knew them not,bible-kjv
and he cast it into the pot and he said pour out for the people that they may eat,bible-kjv
he said again give the people that they may eat for thus saith the lord they shall eat and shall leave thereof,bible-kjv
for he would recover him of his leprosy,bible-kjv
5 7 and it came to pass when the king of israel had read the letter that he rent his clothes and said am i god to kill and to make alive that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy,bible-kjv
5 10 and elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean,bible-kjv
5 13 and his servants came near and spake unto him and said my father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thou not have done it,bible-kjv
and he urged him to take it but he refused,bible-kjv
so he departed from him a little way,bible-kjv
my master hath sent me saying behold even now there be come to me from mount ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets give them i pray thee a talent of silver and two changes of garments,bible-kjv
and elisha said unto him whence comest thou gehazi,bible-kjv
and he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow,bible-kjv
and he answered i will go,bible-kjv
6 6 and the man of god said where fell it,bible-kjv
6 8 then the king of syria warred against israel and took counsel with his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my camp,bible-kjv
6 13 and he said go and spy where he is that i may send and fetch him,bible-kjv
how shall we do,bible-kjv
and he smote them with blindness according to the word of elisha,bible-kjv
6 21 and the king of israel said unto elisha when he saw them my father shall i smite them,bible-kjv
so the bands of syria came no more into the land of israel,bible-kjv
out of the barnfloor or out of the winepress,bible-kjv
6 31 then he said god do so and more also to me if the head of elisha the son of shaphat shall stand on him this day,bible-kjv
7 2 then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god and said behold if the lord would make windows in heaven might this thing be,bible-kjv
7 5 and they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the syrians and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of syria behold there was no man there,bible-kjv
7 10 so they came and called unto the porter of the city and they told them saying we came to the camp of the syrians and behold there was no man there neither voice of man but horses tied and asses tied and the tents as they were,bible-kjv
7 14 they took therefore two chariot horses and the king sent after the host of the syrians saying go and see,bible-kjv
7 17 and the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate and the people trode upon him in the gate and he died as the man of god had said who spake when the king came down to him,bible-kjv
8 2 and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of god and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the philistines seven years,bible-kjv
8 6 and when the king asked the woman she told him,bible-kjv
8 10 and elisha said unto him go say unto him thou mayest certainly recover howbeit the lord hath shewed me that he shall surely die,bible-kjv
and elisha answered the lord hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over syria,bible-kjv
8 17 thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem,bible-kjv
8 22 yet edom revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day,bible-kjv
8 26 two and twenty years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem,bible-kjv
and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel because he was sick,bible-kjv
and jehu said unto which of all us,bible-kjv
and he opened the door and fled,bible-kjv
and he said thus and thus spake he to me saying thus saith the lord i have anointed thee king over israel,bible-kjv
and jehu said if it be your minds then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in jezreel,bible-kjv
9 18 so there went one on horseback to meet him and said thus saith the king is it peace,bible-kjv
and jehu answered what hast thou to do with peace,bible-kjv
and joram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah went out each in his chariot and they went out against jehu and met him in the portion of naboth the jezreelite,bible-kjv
9 25 then said jehu to bidkar his captain take up and cast him in the portion of the field of naboth the jezreelite for remember how that when i and thou rode together after ahab his father the lord laid this burden upon him 9 26 surely i have seen yesterday the blood of naboth and the blood of his sons saith the lord and i will requite thee in this plat saith the lord,bible-kjv
and he fled to megiddo and died there,bible-kjv
9 32 and he lifted up his face to the window and said who is on my side,bible-kjv
9 34 and when he was come in he did eat and drink and said go see now this cursed woman and bury her for she is a king s daughter,bible-kjv
and jehu wrote letters and sent to samaria unto the rulers of jezreel to the elders and to them that brought up ahab s children saying 10 2 now as soon as this letter cometh to you seeing your master s sons are with you and there are with you chariots and horses a fenced city also and armour 10 3 look even out the best and meetest of your master s sons and set him on his father s throne and fight for your master s house,bible-kjv
10 7 and it came to pass when the letter came to them that they took the king s sons and slew seventy persons and put their heads in baskets and sent him them to jezreel,bible-kjv
10 11 so jehu slew all that remained of the house of ahab in jezreel and all his great men and his kinsfolks and his priests until he left him none remaining,bible-kjv
and they took them alive and slew them at the pit of the shearing house even two and forty men neither left he any of them,bible-kjv
10 16 and he said come with me and see my zeal for the lord,bible-kjv
but jehu did it in subtilty to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of baal,bible-kjv
10 22 and he said unto him that was over the vestry bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of baal,bible-kjv
and they smote them with the edge of the sword and the guard and the captains cast them out and went to the city of the house of baal,bible-kjv
10 30 and the lord said unto jehu because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes and hast done unto the house of ahab according to all that was in mine heart thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of israel,bible-kjv
and jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead,bible-kjv
and athaliah did reign over the land,bible-kjv
11 9 and the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that jehoiada the priest commanded and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath with them that should go out on the sabbath and came to jehoiada the priest,bible-kjv
11 14 and when she looked behold the king stood by a pillar as the manner was and the princes and the trumpeters by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew with trumpets and athaliah rent her clothes and cried treason treason,bible-kjv
11 18 and all the people of the land went into the house of baal and brake it down his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars,bible-kjv
11 21 seven years old was jehoash when he began to reign,bible-kjv
12 4 and jehoash said to the priests all the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the lord even the money of every one that passeth the account the money that every man is set at and all the money that cometh into any man s heart to bring into the house of the lord 12 5 let the priests take it to them every man of his acquaintance and let them repair the breaches of the house wheresoever any breach shall be found,bible-kjv
12 9 but jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one cometh into the house of the lord and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the lord,bible-kjv
12 16 the trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the lord it was the priests,bible-kjv
12 21 for jozachar the son of shimeath and jehozabad the son of shomer his servants smote him and he died and they buried him with his fathers in the city of david and amaziah his son reigned in his stead,bible-kjv
13 5 and the lord gave israel a saviour so that they went out from under the hand of the syrians and the children of israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime,bible-kjv
13 10 in the thirty and seventh year of joash king of judah began jehoash the son of jehoahaz to reign over israel in samaria and reigned sixteen years,bible-kjv
and joash the king of israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said o my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof,bible-kjv
13 17 and he said open the window eastward,bible-kjv
13 18 and he said take the arrows,bible-kjv
13 20 and elisha died and they buried him,bible-kjv
13 24 so hazael king of syria died and benhadad his son reigned in his stead,bible-kjv
and his mother s name was jehoaddan of jerusalem,bible-kjv
14 7 he slew of edom in the valley of salt ten thousand and took selah by war and called the name of it joktheel unto this day,bible-kjv
therefore jehoash king of israel went up and he and amaziah king of judah looked one another in the face at bethshemesh which belongeth to judah,bible-kjv
14 16 and jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria with the kings of israel and jeroboam his son reigned in his stead,bible-kjv
14 21 and all the people of judah took azariah which was sixteen years old and made him king instead of his father amaziah,bible-kjv
14 26 for the lord saw the affliction of israel that it was very bitter for there was not any shut up nor any left nor any helper for israel,bible-kjv
15 2 sixteen years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned two and fifty years in jerusalem,bible-kjv
15 6 and the rest of the acts of azariah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah,bible-kjv
15 11 and the rest of the acts of zachariah behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel,bible-kjv
15 15 and the rest of the acts of shallum and his conspiracy which he made behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel,bible-kjv
15 20 and menahem exacted the money of israel even of all the mighty men of wealth of each man fifty shekels of silver to give to the king of assyria,bible-kjv
15 24 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he departed not from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin,bible-kjv
15 29 in the days of pekah king of israel came tiglathpileser king of assyria and took ijon and abelbethmaachah and janoah and kedesh and hazor and gilead and galilee all the land of naphtali and carried them captive to assyria,bible-kjv
and his mother s name was jerusha the daughter of zadok,bible-kjv
15 37 in those days the lord began to send against judah rezin the king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah,bible-kjv
16 4 and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree,bible-kjv
16 9 and the king of assyria hearkened unto him for the king of assyria went up against damascus and took it and carried the people of it captive to kir and slew rezin,bible-kjv
16 14 and he brought also the brasen altar which was before the lord from the forefront of the house from between the altar and the house of the lord and put it on the north side of the altar,bible-kjv
16 19 now the rest of the acts of ahaz which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah,bible-kjv
17 4 and the king of assyria found conspiracy in hoshea for he had sent messengers to so king of egypt and brought no present to the king of assyria as he had done year by year therefore the king of assyria shut him up and bound him in prison,bible-kjv
17 10 and they set them up images and groves in every high hill and under every green tree 17 11 and there they burnt incense in all the high places as did the heathen whom the lord carried away before them and wrought wicked things to provoke the lord to anger 17 12 for they served idols whereof the lord had said unto them ye shall not do this thing,bible-kjv
17 17 and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire and used divination and enchantments and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger,bible-kjv
17 22 for the children of israel walked in all the sins of jeroboam which he did they departed not from them 17 23 until the lord removed israel out of his sight as he had said by all his servants the prophets,bible-kjv
17 27 then the king of assyria commanded saying carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence and let them go and dwell there and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land,bible-kjv
17 33 they feared the lord and served their own gods after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence,bible-kjv
17 40 howbeit they did not hearken but they did after their former manner,bible-kjv
18 3 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that david his father did,bible-kjv
18 8 he smote the philistines even unto gaza and the borders thereof from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city,bible-kjv
18 14 and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to lachish saying i have offended return from me that which thou puttest on me will i bear,bible-kjv
and they went up and came to jerusalem,bible-kjv
now on whom dost thou trust that thou rebellest against me,bible-kjv
18 25 am i now come up without the lord against this place to destroy it,bible-kjv
18 28 then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and spake saying hear the word of the great king the king of assyria 18 29 thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand 18 30 neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria,bible-kjv
have they delivered samaria out of mine hand,bible-kjv
19 2 and he sent eliakim which was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to isaiah the prophet the son of amoz,bible-kjv
19 7 behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and shall return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land,bible-kjv
19 13 where is the king of hamath and the king of arpad and the king of the city of sepharvaim of hena and ivah,bible-kjv
19 19 now therefore o lord our god i beseech thee save thou us out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord god even thou only,bible-kjv
even against the holy one of israel,bible-kjv
19 26 therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the house tops and as corn blasted before it be grown up,bible-kjv
19 31 for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escape out of mount zion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this,bible-kjv
19 36 so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at nineveh,bible-kjv
20 2 then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lord saying 20 3 i beseech thee o lord remember now how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight,bible-kjv
and they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered,bible-kjv
20 12 at that time berodachbaladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters and a present unto hezekiah for he had heard that hezekiah had been sick,bible-kjv
20 15 and he said what have they seen in thine house,bible-kjv
20 19 then said hezekiah unto isaiah good is the word of the lord which thou hast spoken,bible-kjv
and his mother s name was hephzibah,bible-kjv
21 6 and he made his son pass through the fire and observed times and used enchantments and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger,bible-kjv
21 14 and i will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies 21 15 because they have done that which was evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger since the day their fathers came forth out of egypt even unto this day,bible-kjv
and his mother s name was meshullemeth the daughter of haruz of jotbah,bible-kjv
21 25 now the rest of the acts of amon which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah,bible-kjv
22 3 and it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king josiah that the king sent shaphan the son of azaliah the son of meshullam the scribe to the house of the lord saying 22 4 go up to hilkiah the high priest that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the lord which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people 22 5 and let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work that have the oversight of the house of the lord and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the lord to repair the breaches of the house 22 6 unto carpenters and builders and masons and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house,bible-kjv
22 10 and shaphan the scribe shewed the king saying hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book,bible-kjv
22 15 and she said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel tell the man that sent you to me 22 16 thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the words of the book which the king of judah hath read 22 17 because they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and shall not be quenched,bible-kjv
23 2 and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the men of judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with him and the priests and the prophets and all the people both small and great and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the lord,bible-kjv

23 11 and he took away the horses that the kings of judah had given to the sun at the entering in of the house of the lord by the chamber of nathanmelech the chamberlain which was in the suburbs and burned the chariots of the sun with fire,bible-kjv
23 16 and as josiah turned himself he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount and sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres and burned them upon the altar and polluted it according to the word of the lord which the man of god proclaimed who proclaimed these words,bible-kjv
23 19 and all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of samaria which the kings of israel had made to provoke the lord to anger josiah took away and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in bethel,bible-kjv

13 6 and david went up and all israel to baalah that is to kirjathjearim which belonged to judah to bring up thence the ark of god the lord that dwelleth between the cherubims whose name is called on it,bible-kjv
13 11 and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach upon uzza wherefore that place is called perezuzza to this day,bible-kjv
14 1 now hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and timber of cedars with masons and carpenters to build him an house,bible-kjv
and david heard of it and went out against them,bible-kjv
14 11 so they came up to baalperazim and david smote them there,bible-kjv
14 15 and it shall be when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt go out to battle for god is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the philistines,bible-kjv
15 3 and david gathered all israel together to jerusalem to bring up the ark of the lord unto his place which he had prepared for it,bible-kjv
15 15 and the children of the levites bare the ark of god upon their shoulders with the staves thereon as moses commanded according to the word of the lord,bible-kjv
15 23 and berechiah and elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark,bible-kjv
15 28 thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the lord with shouting and with sound of the cornet and with trumpets and with cymbals making a noise with psalteries and harps,bible-kjv
16 4 and he appointed certain of the levites to minister before the ark of the lord and to record and to thank and praise the lord god of israel 16 5 asaph the chief and next to him zechariah jeiel and shemiramoth and jehiel and mattithiah and eliab and benaiah and obededom and jeiel with psalteries and with harps but asaph made a sound with cymbals 16 6 benaiah also and jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of god,bible-kjv

16 33 then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the lord because he cometh to judge the earth,bible-kjv
16 37 so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the lord asaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually as every day s work required 16 38 and obededom with their brethren threescore and eight obededom also the son of jeduthun and hosah to be porters 16 39 and zadok the priest and his brethren the priests before the tabernacle of the lord in the high place that was at gibeon 16 40 to offer burnt offerings unto the lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening and to do according to all that is written in the law of the lord which he commanded israel 16 41 and with them heman and jeduthun and the rest that were chosen who were expressed by name to give thanks to the lord because his mercy endureth for ever 16 42 and with them heman and jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound and with musical instruments of god,bible-kjv
17 3 and it came to pass the same night that the word of god came to nathan saying 17 4 go and tell david my servant thus saith the lord thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in 17 5 for i have not dwelt in an house since the day that i brought up israel unto this day but have gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to another,bible-kjv
furthermore i tell thee that the lord will build thee an house,bible-kjv
17 16 and david the king came and sat before the lord and said who am i o lord god and what is mine house that thou hast brought me hitherto,bible-kjv
17 20 o lord there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears,bible-kjv
17 25 for thou o my god hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee,bible-kjv
18 4 and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand footmen david also houghed all the chariot horses but reserved of them an hundred chariots,bible-kjv
18 8 likewise from tibhath and from chun cities of hadarezer brought david very much brass wherewith solomon made the brasen sea and the pillars and the vessels of brass,bible-kjv
thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went,bible-kjv
19 2 and david said i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash because his father shewed kindness to me,bible-kjv
19 4 wherefore hanun took david s servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks and sent them away,bible-kjv
19 7 so they hired thirty and two thousand chariots and the king of maachah and his people who came and pitched before medeba,bible-kjv
19 11 and the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of abishai his brother and they set themselves in array against the children of ammon,bible-kjv
then joab came to jerusalem,bible-kjv
19 19 and when the servants of hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before israel they made peace with david and became his servants neither would the syrians help the children of ammon any more,bible-kjv
20 3 and he brought out the people that were in it and cut them with saws and with harrows of iron and with axes,bible-kjv
20 6 and yet again there was war at gath where was a man of great stature whose fingers and toes were four and twenty six on each hand and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant,bible-kjv
21 3 and joab answered the lord make his people an hundred times so many more as they be but my lord the king are they not all my lord s servants,bible-kjv
21 5 and joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto david,bible-kjv
21 9 and the lord spake unto gad david s seer saying 21 10 go and tell david saying thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee,bible-kjv
21 15 and god sent an angel unto jerusalem to destroy it and as he was destroying the lord beheld and he repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed it is enough stay now thine hand,bible-kjv
even i it is that have sinned and done evil indeed but as for these sheep what have they done,bible-kjv
now ornan was threshing wheat,bible-kjv
21 25 so david gave to ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight,bible-kjv
21 30 but david could not go before it to enquire of god for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the lord,bible-kjv
so david prepared abundantly before his death,bible-kjv
22 11 now my son the lord be with thee and prosper thou and build the house of the lord thy god as he hath said of thee,bible-kjv
22 16 of the gold the silver and the brass and the iron there is no number,bible-kjv
22 19 now set your heart and your soul to seek the lord your god arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the lord god to bring the ark of the covenant of the lord and the holy vessels of god into the house that is to be built to the name of the lord,bible-kjv
23 6 and david divided them into courses among the sons of levi namely gershon kohath and merari,bible-kjv
23 10 and the sons of shimei were jahath zina and jeush and beriah,bible-kjv
23 14 now concerning moses the man of god his sons were named of the tribe of levi,bible-kjv
23 18 of the sons of izhar shelomith the chief,bible-kjv
23 22 and eleazar died and had no sons but daughters and their brethren the sons of kish took them,bible-kjv
24 1 now these are the divisions of the sons of aaron,bible-kjv
among the sons of eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers and eight among the sons of ithamar according to the house of their fathers,bible-kjv
24 20 and the rest of the sons of levi were these of the sons of amram shubael of the sons of shubael jehdeiah,bible-kjv
24 25 the brother of michah was isshiah of the sons of isshiah zechariah,bible-kjv
24 30 the sons also of mushi mahli and eder and jerimoth,bible-kjv
25 4 of heman the sons of heman bukkiah mattaniah uzziel shebuel and jerimoth hananiah hanani eliathah giddalti and romamtiezer joshbekashah mallothi hothir and mahazioth 25 5 all these were the sons of heman the king s seer in the words of god to lift up the horn,bible-kjv
25 9 now the first lot came forth for asaph to joseph the second to gedaliah who with his brethren and sons were twelve 25 10 the third to zaccur he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 11 the fourth to izri he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 12 the fifth to nethaniah he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 13 the sixth to bukkiah he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 14 the seventh to jesharelah he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 15 the eighth to jeshaiah he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 16 the ninth to mattaniah he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 17 the tenth to shimei he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 18 the eleventh to azareel he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 19 the twelfth to hashabiah he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 20 the thirteenth to shubael he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 21 the fourteenth to mattithiah he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 22 the fifteenth to jeremoth he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 23 the sixteenth to hananiah he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 24 the seventeenth to joshbekashah he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 25 the eighteenth to hanani he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 26 the nineteenth to mallothi he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 27 the twentieth to eliathah he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 28 the one and twentieth to hothir he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 29 the two and twentieth to giddalti he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 30 the three and twentieth to mahazioth he his sons and his brethren were twelve 25 31 the four and twentieth to romamtiezer he his sons and his brethren were twelve,bible-kjv
26 6 also unto shemaiah his son were sons born that ruled throughout the house of their father for they were mighty men of valour,bible-kjv
26 12 among these were the divisions of the porters even among the chief men having wards one against another to minister in the house of the lord,bible-kjv
26 16 to shuppim and hosah the lot came forth westward with the gate shallecheth by the causeway of the going up ward against ward,bible-kjv
26 21 as concerning the sons of laadan the sons of the gershonite laadan chief fathers even of laadan the gershonite were jehieli,bible-kjv
26 27 out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house of the lord,bible-kjv
in the fortieth year of the reign of david they were sought for and there were found among them mighty men of valour at jazer of gilead,bible-kjv
27 4 and over the course of the second month was dodai an ahohite and of his course was mikloth also the ruler in his course likewise were twenty and four thousand,bible-kjv
27 9 the sixth captain for the sixth month was ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite and in his course were twenty and four thousand,bible-kjv
27 14 the eleventh captain for the eleventh month was benaiah the pirathonite of the children of ephraim and in his course were twenty and four thousand,bible-kjv
27 24 joab the son of zeruiah began to number but he finished not because there fell wrath for it against israel neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king david,bible-kjv
28 2 then david the king stood up upon his feet and said hear me my brethren and my people as for me i had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the lord and for the footstool of our god and had made ready for the building 28 3 but god said unto me thou shalt not build an house for my name because thou hast been a man of war and hast shed blood,bible-kjv
28 9 and thou solomon my son know thou the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind for the lord searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts if thou seek him he will be found of thee but if thou forsake him he will cast thee off for ever,bible-kjv
28 19 all this said david the lord made me understand in writing by his hand upon me even all the works of this pattern,bible-kjv
29 3 moreover because i have set my affection to the house of my god i have of mine own proper good of gold and silver which i have given to the house of my god over and above all that i have prepared for the holy house,bible-kjv
29 9 then the people rejoiced for that they offered willingly because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the lord and david the king also rejoiced with great joy,bible-kjv
29 14 but who am i and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort,bible-kjv
as for me in the uprightness of mine heart i have willingly offered all these things and now have i seen with joy thy people which are present here to offer willingly unto thee,bible-kjv
and they made solomon the son of david king the second time and anointed him unto the lord to be the chief governor and zadok to be priest,bible-kjv
29 27 and the time that he reigned over israel was forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem,bible-kjv
1 2 then solomon spake unto all israel to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every governor in all israel the chief of the fathers,bible-kjv
1 7 in that night did god appear unto solomon and said unto him ask what i shall give thee,bible-kjv
1 13 then solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at gibeon to jerusalem from before the tabernacle of the congregation and reigned over israel,bible-kjv
2 1 and solomon determined to build an house for the name of the lord and an house for his kingdom,bible-kjv
2 5 and the house which i build is great for great is our god above all gods,bible-kjv
2 10 and behold i will give to thy servants the hewers that cut timber twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of oil,bible-kjv
2 17 and solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of israel after the numbering wherewith david his father had numbered them and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred,bible-kjv
the length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits and the breadth twenty cubits,bible-kjv
3 8 and he made the most holy house the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits and he overlaid it with fine gold amounting to six hundred talents,bible-kjv
3 12 and one wing of the other cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was five cubits also joining to the wing of the other cherub,bible-kjv
3 17 and he reared up the pillars before the temple one on the right hand and the other on the left and called the name of that on the right hand jachin and the name of that on the left boaz,bible-kjv
4 4 it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them and all their hinder parts were inward,bible-kjv
and he made an hundred basons of gold,bible-kjv
4 14 he made also bases and lavers made he upon the bases 4 15 one sea and twelve oxen under it,bible-kjv
5 1 thus all the work that solomon made for the house of the lord was finished and solomon brought in all the things that david his father had dedicated and the silver and the gold and all the instruments put he among the treasures of the house of god,bible-kjv
5 6 also king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen which could not be told nor numbered for multitude,bible-kjv
5 11 and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did not then wait by course 5 12 also the levites which were the singers all of them of asaph of heman of jeduthun with their sons and their brethren being arrayed in white linen having cymbals and psalteries and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets 5 13 it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick and praised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the lord 5 14 so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of god,bible-kjv
6 7 now it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel,bible-kjv
6 14 and said o lord god of israel there is no god like thee in the heaven nor in the earth which keepest covenant and shewest mercy unto thy servants that walk before thee with all their hearts 6 15 thou which hast kept with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him and spakest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this day,bible-kjv
6 19 have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee 6 20 that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place,bible-kjv
6 28 if there be dearth in the land if there be pestilence if there be blasting or mildew locusts or caterpillers if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be 6 29 then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man or of all thy people israel when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief and shall spread forth his hands in this house 6 30 then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and render unto every man according unto all his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men 6 31 that they may fear thee to walk in thy ways so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers,bible-kjv
6 41 now therefore arise o lord god into thy resting place thou and the ark of thy strength let thy priests o lord god be clothed with salvation and let thy saints rejoice in goodness,bible-kjv
7 4 then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the lord,bible-kjv
7 9 and in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days,bible-kjv
7 15 now mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place,bible-kjv
7 22 and it shall be answered because they forsook the lord god of their fathers which brought them forth out of the land of egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshipped them and served them therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them,bible-kjv
8 7 as for all the people that were left of the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites which were not of israel 8 8 but of their children who were left after them in the land whom the children of israel consumed not them did solomon make to pay tribute until this day,bible-kjv
8 14 and he appointed according to the order of david his father the courses of the priests to their service and the levites to their charges to praise and minister before the priests as the duty of every day required the porters also by their courses at every gate for so had david the man of god commanded,bible-kjv
8 18 and huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships and servants that had knowledge of the sea and they went with the servants of solomon to ophir and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought them to king solomon,bible-kjv
9 7 happy are thy men and happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom,bible-kjv
9 12 and king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which she had brought unto the king,bible-kjv
9 16 and three hundred shields made he of beaten gold three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield,bible-kjv
9 20 and all the drinking vessels of king solomon were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was not any thing accounted of in the days of solomon,bible-kjv
9 25 and solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and twelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem,bible-kjv
9 30 and solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel forty years,bible-kjv
so jeroboam and all israel came and spake to rehoboam saying 10 4 thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us and we will serve thee,bible-kjv
10 8 but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him that stood before him,bible-kjv
10 13 and the king answered them roughly and king rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men 10 14 and answered them after the advice of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy but i will add thereto my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions,bible-kjv
10 17 but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them,bible-kjv
11 2 but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god saying 11 3 speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all israel in judah and benjamin saying 11 4 thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren return every man to his house for this thing is done of me,bible-kjv
11 12 and in every several city he put shields and spears and made them exceeding strong having judah and benjamin on his side,bible-kjv
11 18 and rehoboam took him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david to wife and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse 11 19 which bare him children jeush and shamariah and zaham,bible-kjv
and he desired many wives,bible-kjv
12 6 whereupon the princes of israel and the king humbled themselves and they said the lord is righteous,bible-kjv
12 11 and when the king entered into the house of the lord the guard came and fetched them and brought them again into the guard chamber,bible-kjv
12 15 now the acts of rehoboam first and last are they not written in the book of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer concerning genealogies,bible-kjv
his mother s name also was michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah,bible-kjv
13 7 and there are gathered unto him vain men the children of belial and have strengthened themselves against rehoboam the son of solomon when rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them,bible-kjv
13 12 and behold god himself is with us for our captain and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you,bible-kjv
13 16 and the children of israel fled before judah and god delivered them into their hand,bible-kjv
13 21 but abijah waxed mighty and married fourteen wives and begat twenty and two sons and sixteen daughters,bible-kjv
14 5 also he took away out of all the cities of judah the high places and the images and the kingdom was quiet before him,bible-kjv
14 9 and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and came unto mareshah,bible-kjv
14 13 and asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto gerar and the ethiopians were overthrown that they could not recover themselves for they were destroyed before the lord and before his host and they carried away very much spoil,bible-kjv
15 4 but when they in their trouble did turn unto the lord god of israel and sought him he was found of them,bible-kjv
15 9 and he gathered all judah and benjamin and the strangers with them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon for they fell to him out of israel in abundance when they saw that the lord his god was with him,bible-kjv
15 15 and all judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was found of them and the lord gave them rest round about,bible-kjv
16 1 in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of israel came up against judah and built ramah to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to asa king of judah,bible-kjv
16 7 and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and said unto him because thou hast relied on the king of syria and not relied on the lord thy god therefore is the host of the king of syria escaped out of thine hand,bible-kjv
16 10 then asa was wroth with the seer and put him in a prison house for he was in a rage with him because of this thing,bible-kjv
16 14 and they buried him in his own sepulchres which he had made for himself in the city of david and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries art and they made a very great burning for him,bible-kjv
17 6 and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the lord moreover he took away the high places and groves out of judah,bible-kjv
17 11 also some of the philistines brought jehoshaphat presents and tribute silver and the arabians brought him flocks seven thousand and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats,bible-kjv
17 16 and next him was amasiah the son of zichri who willingly offered himself unto the lord and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour,bible-kjv
18 2 and after certain years he went down to ahab to samaria,bible-kjv
18 5 therefore the king of israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men and said unto them shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear,bible-kjv
18 8 and the king of israel called for one of his officers and said fetch quickly micaiah the son of imla,bible-kjv
18 13 and micaiah said as the lord liveth even what my god saith that will i speak,bible-kjv
18 17 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me but evil,bible-kjv
and the lord said unto him wherewith,bible-kjv
18 24 and micaiah said behold thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself,bible-kjv
18 29 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and i will go to the battle but put thou on thy robes,bible-kjv
18 32 for it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel they turned back again from pursuing him,bible-kjv
therefore is wrath upon thee from before the lord,bible-kjv
19 8 moreover in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levites and of the priests and of the chief of the fathers of israel for the judgment of the lord and for controversies when they returned to jerusalem,bible-kjv
20 1 it came to pass after this also that the children of moab and the children of ammon and with them other beside the ammonites came against jehoshaphat to battle,bible-kjv
and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen,bible-kjv
20 12 o our god wilt thou not judge them,bible-kjv
20 17 ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord with you o judah and jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed to morrow go out against them for the lord will be with you,bible-kjv
20 22 and when they began to sing and to praise the lord set ambushments against the children of ammon moab and mount seir which were come against judah and they were smitten,bible-kjv
20 27 then they returned every man of judah and jerusalem and jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem with joy for the lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies,bible-kjv
and his mother s name was azubah the daughter of shilhi,bible-kjv
20 37 then eliezer the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesied against jehoshaphat saying because thou hast joined thyself with ahaziah the lord hath broken thy works,bible-kjv
21 3 and their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things with fenced cities in judah but the kingdom gave he to jehoram because he was the firstborn,bible-kjv
21 8 in his days the edomites revolted from under the dominion of judah and made themselves a king,bible-kjv
21 12 and there came a writing to him from elijah the prophet saying thus saith the lord god of david thy father because thou hast not walked in the ways of jehoshaphat thy father nor in the ways of asa king of judah 21 13 but hast walked in the way of the kings of israel and hast made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to go a whoring like to the whoredoms of the house of ahab and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father s house which were better than thyself 21 14 behold with a great plague will the lord smite thy people and thy children and thy wives and all thy goods 21 15 and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day,bible-kjv
21 20 thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem eight years and departed without being desired,bible-kjv
his mother s name also was athaliah the daughter of omri,bible-kjv
and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel because he was sick,bible-kjv
22 10 but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of judah,bible-kjv
23 2 and they went about in judah and gathered the levites out of all the cities of judah and the chief of the fathers of israel and they came to jerusalem,bible-kjv
23 7 and the levites shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and whosoever else cometh into the house he shall be put to death but be ye with the king when he cometh in and when he goeth out,bible-kjv
and jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said god save the king,bible-kjv
23 15 so they laid hands on her and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the king s house they slew her there,bible-kjv
23 20 and he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and the governors of the people and all the people of the land and brought down the king from the house of the lord and they came through the high gate into the king s house and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom,bible-kjv
24 3 and jehoiada took for him two wives and he begat sons and daughters,bible-kjv
24 7 for the sons of athaliah that wicked woman had broken up the house of god and also all the dedicated things of the house of the lord did they bestow upon baalim,bible-kjv
thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance,bible-kjv
24 15 but jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died,bible-kjv
24 19 yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again unto the lord and they testified against them but they would not give ear,bible-kjv
and when he died he said the lord look upon it and require it,bible-kjv
24 26 and these are they that conspired against him zabad the son of shimeath an ammonitess and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabitess,bible-kjv
25 2 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord but not with a perfect heart,bible-kjv
25 7 but there came a man of god to him saying o king let not the army of israel go with thee for the lord is not with israel to wit with all the children of ephraim,bible-kjv
25 11 and amaziah strengthened himself and led forth his people and went to the valley of salt and smote of the children of seir ten thousand,bible-kjv
25 16 and it came to pass as he talked with him that the king said unto him art thou made of the king s counsel,bible-kjv
25 19 thou sayest lo thou hast smitten the edomites and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast abide now at home why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with thee,bible-kjv
25 24 and he took all the gold and the silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of god with obededom and the treasures of the king s house the hostages also and returned to samaria,bible-kjv
26 1 then all the people of judah took uzziah who was sixteen years old and made him king in the room of his father amaziah,bible-kjv
26 5 and he sought god in the days of zechariah who had understanding in the visions of god and as long as he sought the lord god made him to prosper,bible-kjv
26 10 also he built towers in the desert and digged many wells for he had much cattle both in the low country and in the plains husbandmen also and vine dressers in the mountains and in carmel for he loved husbandry,bible-kjv
26 15 and he made in jerusalem engines invented by cunning men to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks to shoot arrows and great stones withal,bible-kjv
26 20 and azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him out from thence yea himself hasted also to go out because the lord had smitten him,bible-kjv
his mother s name also was jerushah the daughter of zadok,bible-kjv
27 5 he fought also with the king of the ammonites and prevailed against them,bible-kjv
27 8 he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in jerusalem,bible-kjv
28 5 wherefore the lord his god delivered him into the hand of the king of syria and they smote him and carried away a great multitude of them captives and brought them to damascus,bible-kjv
28 9 but a prophet of the lord was there whose name was oded and he went out before the host that came to samaria and said unto them behold because the lord god of your fathers was wroth with judah he hath delivered them into your hand and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven,bible-kjv
28 15 and the men which were expressed by name rose up and took the captives and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them and arrayed them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drink and anointed them and carried all the feeble of them upon asses and brought them to jericho the city of palm trees to their brethren then they returned to samaria,bible-kjv
28 20 and tilgathpilneser king of assyria came unto him and distressed him but strengthened him not,bible-kjv
28 24 and ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of god and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of god and shut up the doors of the house of the lord and he made him altars in every corner of jerusalem,bible-kjv
and his mother s name was abijah the daughter of zechariah,bible-kjv
29 7 also they have shut up the doors of the porch and put out the lamps and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the god of israel,bible-kjv
29 12 then the levites arose mahath the son of amasai and joel the son of azariah of the sons of the kohathites and of the sons of merari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehalelel and of the gershonites joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah 29 13 and of the sons of elizaphan shimri and jeiel and of the sons of asaph zechariah and mattaniah 29 14 and of the sons of heman jehiel and shimei and of the sons of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel,bible-kjv
29 18 then they went in to hezekiah the king and said we have cleansed all the house of the lord and the altar of burnt offering with all the vessels thereof and the shewbread table with all the vessels thereof,bible-kjv
29 22 so they killed the bullocks and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar likewise when they had killed the rams they sprinkled the blood upon the altar they killed also the lambs and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar,bible-kjv
and when the burnt offering began the song of the lord began also with the trumpets and with the instruments ordained by david king of israel,bible-kjv
29 31 then hezekiah answered and said now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the lord come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the lord,bible-kjv
29 35 and also the burnt offerings were in abundance with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for every burnt offering,bible-kjv
30 3 for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently neither had the people gathered themselves together to jerusalem,bible-kjv
30 8 now be ye not stiffnecked as your fathers were but yield yourselves unto the lord and enter into his sanctuary which he hath sanctified for ever and serve the lord your god that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you,bible-kjv
30 13 and there assembled at jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month a very great congregation,bible-kjv
30 18 for a multitude of the people even many of ephraim and manasseh issachar and zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written,bible-kjv
30 23 and the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days and they kept other seven days with gladness,bible-kjv
31 1 now when all this was finished all israel that were present went out to the cities of judah and brake the images in pieces and cut down the groves and threw down the high places and the altars out of all judah and benjamin in ephraim also and manasseh until they had utterly destroyed them all,bible-kjv
31 5 and as soon as the commandment came abroad the children of israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn wine and oil and honey and of all the increase of the field and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly,bible-kjv
31 10 and azariah the chief priest of the house of zadok answered him and said since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the lord we have had enough to eat and have left plenty for the lord hath blessed his people and that which is left is this great store,bible-kjv
31 20 and thus did hezekiah throughout all judah and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the lord his god,bible-kjv
32 5 also he strengthened himself and built up all the wall that was broken and raised it up to the towers and another wall without and repaired millo in the city of david and made darts and shields in abundance,bible-kjv
32 12 hath not the same hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded judah and jerusalem saying ye shall worship before one altar and burn incense upon it,bible-kjv
32 16 and his servants spake yet more against the lord god and against his servant hezekiah,bible-kjv
32 21 and the lord sent an angel which cut off all the mighty men of valour and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of assyria,bible-kjv
32 24 in those days hezekiah was sick to the death and prayed unto the lord and he spake unto him and he gave him a sign,bible-kjv
32 30 this same hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of gihon and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of david,bible-kjv
and manasseh his son reigned in his stead,bible-kjv
33 6 and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of hinnom also he observed times and used enchantments and used witchcraft and dealt with a familiar spirit and with wizards he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger,bible-kjv
33 12 and when he was in affliction he besought the lord his god and humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers 33 13 and prayed unto him and he was intreated of him and heard his supplication and brought him again to jerusalem into his kingdom,bible-kjv
33 17 nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places yet unto the lord their god only,bible-kjv
33 22 but he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as did manasseh his father for amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which manasseh his father had made and served them 33 23 and humbled not himself before the lord as manasseh his father had humbled himself but amon trespassed more and more,bible-kjv
34 3 for in the eighth year of his reign while he was yet young he began to seek after the god of david his father and in the twelfth year he began to purge judah and jerusalem from the high places and the groves and the carved images and the molten images,bible-kjv
34 8 now in the eighteenth year of his reign when he had purged the land and the house he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah the governor of the city and joah the son of joahaz the recorder to repair the house of the lord his god,bible-kjv
34 14 and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the lord hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the lord given by moses,bible-kjv
34 18 then shaphan the scribe told the king saying hilkiah the priest hath given me a book,bible-kjv
34 23 and she answered them thus saith the lord god of israel tell ye the man that sent you to me 34 24 thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of judah 34 25 because they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place and shall not be quenched,bible-kjv
34 30 and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and the priests and the levites and all the people great and small and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the lord,bible-kjv
and all his days they departed not from following the lord the god of their fathers,bible-kjv
35 7 and josiah gave to the people of the flock lambs and kids all for the passover offerings for all that were present to the number of thirty thousand and three thousand bullocks these were of the king s substance,bible-kjv
35 12 and they removed the burnt offerings that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people to offer unto the lord as it is written in the book of moses,bible-kjv
35 16 so all the service of the lord was prepared the same day to keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the lord according to the commandment of king josiah,bible-kjv
35 21 but he sent ambassadors to him saying what have i to do with thee thou king of judah,bible-kjv
and all judah and jerusalem mourned for josiah,bible-kjv
36 3 and the king of egypt put him down at jerusalem and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold,bible-kjv
36 7 nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the lord to babylon and put them in his temple at babylon,bible-kjv
36 12 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god and humbled not himself before jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the lord,bible-kjv
36 18 and all the vessels of the house of god great and small and the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king and of his princes all these he brought to babylon,bible-kjv
the lord his god be with him and let him go up,bible-kjv
1 4 and whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth let the men of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods and with beasts beside the freewill offering for the house of god that is in jerusalem,bible-kjv
1 11 all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred,bible-kjv
2 5 the children of arah seven hundred seventy and five,bible-kjv
2 10 the children of bani six hundred forty and two,bible-kjv
2 15 the children of adin four hundred fifty and four,bible-kjv
2 20 the children of gibbar ninety and five,bible-kjv
2 25 the children of kirjatharim chephirah and beeroth seven hundred and forty and three,bible-kjv
2 30 the children of magbish an hundred fifty and six,bible-kjv
2 35 the children of senaah three thousand and six hundred and thirty,bible-kjv
2 40 the levites the children of jeshua and kadmiel of the children of hodaviah seventy and four,bible-kjv
2 58 all the nethinims and the children of solomon s servants were three hundred ninety and two,bible-kjv
2 66 their horses were seven hundred thirty and six their mules two hundred forty and five 2 67 their camels four hundred thirty and five their asses six thousand seven hundred and twenty,bible-kjv
3 3 and they set the altar upon his bases for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the lord even burnt offerings morning and evening,bible-kjv
3 8 now in the second year of their coming unto the house of god at jerusalem in the second month began zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the levites and all they that were come out of the captivity unto jerusalem and appointed the levites from twenty years old and upward to set forward the work of the house of the lord,bible-kjv
3 12 but many of the priests and levites and chief of the fathers who were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for joy 3 13 so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard afar off,bible-kjv
4 7 and in the days of artaxerxes wrote bishlam mithredath tabeel and the rest of their companions unto artaxerxes king of persia and the writing of the letter was written in the syrian tongue and interpreted in the syrian tongue,bible-kjv
4 14 now because we have maintenance from the king s palace and it was not meet for us to see the king s dishonour therefore have we sent and certified the king 4 15 that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers so shalt thou find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious city and hurtful unto kings and provinces and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time for which cause was this city destroyed,bible-kjv
4 20 there have been mighty kings also over jerusalem which have ruled over all countries beyond the river and toll tribute and custom was paid unto them,bible-kjv
so it ceased unto the second year of the reign of darius king of persia,bible-kjv
5 5 but the eye of their god was upon the elders of the jews that they could not cause them to cease till the matter came to darius and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter,bible-kjv
5 11 and thus they returned us answer saying we are the servants of the god of heaven and earth and build the house that was builded these many years ago which a great king of israel builded and set up,bible-kjv
5 17 now therefore if it seem good to the king let there be search made in the king s treasure house which is there at babylon whether it be so that a decree was made of cyrus the king to build this house of god at jerusalem and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter,bible-kjv
6 9 and that which they have need of both young bullocks and rams and lambs for the burnt offerings of the god of heaven wheat salt wine and oil according to the appointment of the priests which are at jerusalem let it be given them day by day without fail 6 10 that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the god of heaven and pray for the life of the king and of his sons,bible-kjv
6 14 and the elders of the jews builded and they prospered through the prophesying of haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo,bible-kjv
6 18 and they set the priests in their divisions and the levites in their courses for the service of god which is at jerusalem as it is written in the book of moses,bible-kjv
7 7 and there went up some of the children of israel and of the priests and the levites and the singers and the porters and the nethinims unto jerusalem in the seventh year of artaxerxes the king,bible-kjv
7 12 artaxerxes king of kings unto ezra the priest a scribe of the law of the god of heaven perfect peace and at such a time,bible-kjv
7 20 and whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy god which thou shalt have occasion to bestow bestow it out of the king s treasure house,bible-kjv
7 26 and whosoever will not do the law of thy god and the law of the king let judgment be executed speedily upon him whether it be unto death or to banishment or to confiscation of goods or to imprisonment,bible-kjv
8 3 of the sons of shechaniah of the sons of pharosh zechariah and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty,bible-kjv
8 8 and of the sons of shephatiah zebadiah the son of michael and with him fourscore males,bible-kjv
8 13 and of the last sons of adonikam whose names are these eliphelet jeiel and shemaiah and with them threescore males,bible-kjv
8 18 and by the good hand of our god upon us they brought us a man of understanding of the sons of mahli the son of levi the son of israel and sherebiah with his sons and his brethren eighteen 8 19 and hashabiah and with him jeshaiah of the sons of merari his brethren and their sons twenty 8 20 also of the nethinims whom david and the princes had appointed for the service of the levites two hundred and twenty nethinims all of them were expressed by name,bible-kjv
8 28 and i said unto them ye are holy unto the lord the vessels are holy also and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the lord god of your fathers,bible-kjv
8 33 now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our god by the hand of meremoth the son of uriah the priest and with him was eleazar the son of phinehas and with them was jozabad the son of jeshua and noadiah the son of binnui levites 8 34 by number and by weight of every one and all the weight was written at that time,bible-kjv
9 3 and when i heard this thing i rent my garment and my mantle and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard and sat down astonied,bible-kjv
9 9 for we were bondmen yet our god hath not forsaken us in our bondage but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of persia to give us a reviving to set up the house of our god and to repair the desolations thereof and to give us a wall in judah and in jerusalem,bible-kjv
wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us so that there should be no remnant nor escaping,bible-kjv
10 4 arise for this matter belongeth unto thee we also will be with thee be of good courage and do it,bible-kjv
10 9 then all the men of judah and benjamin gathered themselves together unto jerusalem within three days,bible-kjv
10 13 but the people are many and it is a time of much rain and we are not able to stand without neither is this a work of one day or two for we are many that have transgressed in this thing,bible-kjv
10 17 and they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month,bible-kjv
10 22 and of the sons of pashur elioenai maaseiah ishmael nethaneel jozabad and elasah,bible-kjv
10 27 and of the sons of zattu elioenai eliashib mattaniah and jeremoth and zabad and aziza,bible-kjv
10 33 of the sons of hashum mattenai mattathah zabad eliphelet jeremai manasseh and shimei,bible-kjv
1 1 the words of nehemiah the son of hachaliah,bible-kjv
1 8 remember i beseech thee the word that thou commandedst thy servant moses saying if ye transgress i will scatter you abroad among the nations 1 9 but if ye turn unto me and keep my commandments and do them though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven yet will i gather them from thence and will bring them unto the place that i have chosen to set my name there,bible-kjv
now i had not been beforetime sad in his presence,bible-kjv
so i prayed to the god of heaven,bible-kjv
2 7 moreover i said unto the king if it please the king let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey me over till i come into judah 2 8 and a letter unto asaph the keeper of the king s forest that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that i shall enter into,bible-kjv
2 11 so i came to jerusalem and was there three days,bible-kjv
2 16 and the rulers knew not whither i went or what i did neither had i as yet told it to the jews nor to the priests nor to the nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work,bible-kjv
2 19 but when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite and geshem the arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing that ye do,bible-kjv
and next to them builded zaccur the son of imri,bible-kjv
3 5 and next unto them the tekoites repaired but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their lord,bible-kjv
3 9 and next unto them repaired rephaiah the son of hur the ruler of the half part of jerusalem,bible-kjv
3 13 the valley gate repaired hanun and the inhabitants of zanoah they built it and set up the doors thereof the locks thereof and the bars thereof and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate,bible-kjv
next unto him repaired hashabiah the ruler of the half part of keilah in his part,bible-kjv
3 22 and after him repaired the priests the men of the plain,bible-kjv
after him pedaiah the son of parosh,bible-kjv
after him repaired also shemaiah the son of shechaniah the keeper of the east gate,bible-kjv
4 1 but it came to pass that when sanballat heard that we builded the wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the jews,bible-kjv
will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned,bible-kjv
4 9 nevertheless we made our prayer unto our god and set a watch against them day and night because of them,bible-kjv
4 14 and i looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses,bible-kjv
and he that sounded the trumpet was by me,bible-kjv
4 23 so neither i nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the guard which followed me none of us put off our clothes saving that every one put them off for washing,bible-kjv
5 5 yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren our children as their children and lo we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already neither is it in our power to redeem them for other men have our lands and vineyards,bible-kjv
or shall they be sold unto us,bible-kjv
5 12 then said they we will restore them and will require nothing of them so will we do as thou sayest,bible-kjv
5 14 moreover from the time that i was appointed to be their governor in the land of judah from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes the king that is twelve years i and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor,bible-kjv
5 19 think upon me my god for good according to all that i have done for this people,bible-kjv
6 5 then sent sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand 6 6 wherein was written it is reported among the heathen and gashmu saith it that thou and the jews think to rebel for which cause thou buildest the wall that thou mayest be their king according to these words,bible-kjv
now therefore o god strengthen my hands,bible-kjv
6 12 and lo i perceived that god had not sent him but that he pronounced this prophecy against me for tobiah and sanballat had hired him,bible-kjv
6 17 moreover in those days the nobles of judah sent many letters unto tobiah and the letters of tobiah came unto them,bible-kjv
7 3 and i said unto them let not the gates of jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot and while they stand by let them shut the doors and bar them and appoint watches of the inhabitants of jerusalem every one in his watch and every one to be over against his house,bible-kjv
7 9 the children of shephatiah three hundred seventy and two,bible-kjv
7 14 the children of zaccai seven hundred and threescore,bible-kjv
7 19 the children of bigvai two thousand threescore and seven,bible-kjv
7 24 the children of hariph an hundred and twelve,bible-kjv
7 29 the men of kirjathjearim chephirah and beeroth seven hundred forty and three,bible-kjv
7 34 the children of the other elam a thousand two hundred fifty and four,bible-kjv
7 39 the priests the children of jedaiah of the house of jeshua nine hundred seventy and three,bible-kjv
7 44 the singers the children of asaph an hundred forty and eight,bible-kjv
7 61 and these were they which went up also from telmelah telharesha cherub addon and immer but they could not shew their father s house nor their seed whether they were of israel,bible-kjv
7 66 the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore 7 67 beside their manservants and their maidservants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women,bible-kjv
7 72 and that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand pound of silver and threescore and seven priests garments,bible-kjv
8 4 and ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose and beside him stood mattithiah and shema and anaiah and urijah and hilkiah and maaseiah on his right hand and on his left hand pedaiah and mishael and malchiah and hashum and hashbadana zechariah and meshullam,bible-kjv
8 9 and nehemiah which is the tirshatha and ezra the priest the scribe and the levites that taught the people said unto all the people this day is holy unto the lord your god mourn not nor weep,bible-kjv
8 13 and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people the priests and the levites unto ezra the scribe even to understand the words of the law,bible-kjv
8 18 also day by day from the first day unto the last day he read in the book of the law of god,bible-kjv
9 4 then stood up upon the stairs of the levites jeshua and bani kadmiel shebaniah bunni sherebiah bani and chenani and cried with a loud voice unto the lord their god,bible-kjv
9 11 and thou didst divide the sea before them so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps as a stone into the mighty waters,bible-kjv
9 20 thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth and gavest them water for their thirst,bible-kjv
9 25 and they took strong cities and a fat land and possessed houses full of all goods wells digged vineyards and oliveyards and fruit trees in abundance so they did eat and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in thy great goodness,bible-kjv
9 31 nevertheless for thy great mercies sake thou didst not utterly consume them nor forsake them for thou art a gracious and merciful god,bible-kjv
9 38 and because of all this we make a sure covenant and write it and our princes levites and priests seal unto it,bible-kjv
10 32 also we made ordinances for us to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our god 10 33 for the shewbread and for the continual meat offering and for the continual burnt offering of the sabbaths of the new moons for the set feasts and for the holy things and for the sin offerings to make an atonement for israel and for all the work of the house of our god,bible-kjv
11 2 and the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell at jerusalem,bible-kjv
11 7 and these are the sons of benjamin sallu the son of meshullam the son of joed the son of pedaiah the son of kolaiah the son of maaseiah the son of ithiel the son of jesaiah,bible-kjv
11 12 and their brethren that did the work of the house were eight hundred twenty and two and adaiah the son of jeroham the son of pelaliah the son of amzi the son of zechariah the son of pashur the son of malchiah,bible-kjv
11 19 moreover the porters akkub talmon and their brethren that kept the gates were an hundred seventy and two,bible-kjv
11 23 for it was the king s commandment concerning them that a certain portion should be for the singers due for every day,bible-kjv
11 32 and at anathoth nob ananiah 11 33 hazor ramah gittaim 11 34 hadid zeboim neballat 11 35 lod and ono the valley of craftsmen,bible-kjv
12 9 also bakbukiah and unni their brethren were over against them in the watches,bible-kjv
12 24 and the chief of the levites hashabiah sherebiah and jeshua the son of kadmiel with their brethren over against them to praise and to give thanks according to the commandment of david the man of god ward over against ward,bible-kjv
12 30 and the priests and the levites purified themselves and purified the people and the gates and the wall,bible-kjv
and the singers sang loud with jezrahiah their overseer,bible-kjv
12 47 and all israel in the days of zerubbabel and in the days of nehemiah gave the portions of the singers and the porters every day his portion and they sanctified holy things unto the levites and the levites sanctified them unto the children of aaron,bible-kjv
13 8 and it grieved me sore therefore i cast forth all the household stuff to tobiah out of the chamber,bible-kjv
13 12 then brought all judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries,bible-kjv
13 17 then i contended with the nobles of judah and said unto them what evil thing is this that ye do and profane the sabbath day,bible-kjv
13 21 then i testified against them and said unto them why lodge ye about the wall,bible-kjv
13 23 in those days also saw i jews that had married wives of ashdod of ammon and of moab 13 24 and their children spake half in the speech of ashdod and could not speak in the jews language but according to the language of each people,bible-kjv
13 28 and one of the sons of joiada the son of eliashib the high priest was son in law to sanballat the horonite therefore i chased him from me,bible-kjv
1 1 now it came to pass in the days of ahasuerus this is ahasuerus which reigned from india even unto ethiopia over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces 1 2 that in those days when the king ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shushan the palace 1 3 in the third year of his reign he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants the power of persia and media the nobles and princes of the provinces being before him 1 4 when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days even an hundred and fourscore days,bible-kjv
1 10 on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with wine he commanded mehuman biztha harbona bigtha and abagtha zethar and carcas the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of ahasuerus the king 1 11 to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal to shew the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on,bible-kjv
1 18 likewise shall the ladies of persia and media say this day unto all the king s princes which have heard of the deed of the queen,bible-kjv
2 1 after these things when the wrath of king ahasuerus was appeased he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her,bible-kjv
2 8 so it came to pass when the king s commandment and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the palace to the custody of hegai that esther was brought also unto the king s house to the custody of hegai keeper of the women,bible-kjv
2 14 in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of shaashgaz the king s chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by name,bible-kjv
2 18 then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants even esther s feast and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king,bible-kjv
2 23 and when inquisition was made of the matter it was found out therefore they were both hanged on a tree and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king,bible-kjv
3 4 now it came to pass when they spake daily unto him and he hearkened not unto them that they told haman to see whether mordecai s matters would stand for he had told them that he was a jew,bible-kjv
3 9 if it please the king let it be written that they may be destroyed and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business to bring it into the king s treasuries,bible-kjv
3 14 the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people that they should be ready against that day,bible-kjv
4 4 so esther s maids and her chamberlains came and told it her,bible-kjv
4 8 also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at shushan to destroy them to shew it unto esther and to declare it unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto the king to make supplication unto him and to make request before him for her people,bible-kjv
4 14 for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou and thy father s house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this,bible-kjv
so esther drew near and touched the top of the sceptre,bible-kjv
5 5 then the king said cause haman to make haste that he may do as esther hath said,bible-kjv
5 7 then answered esther and said my petition and my request is 5 8 if i have found favour in the sight of the king and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them and i will do to morrow as the king hath said,bible-kjv
5 13 yet all this availeth me nothing so long as i see mordecai the jew sitting at the king s gate,bible-kjv
6 3 and the king said what honour and dignity hath been done to mordecai for this,bible-kjv
and the king said let him come in,bible-kjv
6 10 then the king said to haman make haste and take the apparel and the horse as thou hast said and do even so to mordecai the jew that sitteth at the king s gate let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken,bible-kjv
then said his wise men and zeresh his wife unto him if mordecai be of the seed of the jews before whom thou hast begun to fall thou shalt not prevail against him but shalt surely fall before him,bible-kjv
and it shall be performed even to the half of the kingdom,bible-kjv
then haman was afraid before the king and the queen,bible-kjv
7 9 and harbonah one of the chamberlains said before the king behold also the gallows fifty cubits high which haman had made for mordecai who spoken good for the king standeth in the house of haman,bible-kjv
and mordecai came before the king for esther had told what he was unto her,bible-kjv
so esther arose and stood before the king 8 5 and said if it please the king and if i have favour in his sight and the thing seem right before the king and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letters devised by haman the son of hammedatha the agagite which he wrote to destroy the jews which are in all the king s provinces 8 6 for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people,bible-kjv
8 10 and he wrote in the king ahasuerus name and sealed it with the king s ring and sent letters by posts on horseback and riders on mules camels and young dromedaries 8 11 wherein the king granted the jews which were in every city to gather themselves together and to stand for their life to destroy to slay and to cause to perish all the power of the people and province that would assault them both little ones and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey 8 12 upon one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus namely upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar,bible-kjv
8 16 the jews had light and gladness and joy and honour,bible-kjv
9 4 for mordecai was great in the king s house and his fame went out throughout all the provinces for this man mordecai waxed greater and greater,bible-kjv
9 12 and the king said unto esther the queen the jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in shushan the palace and the ten sons of haman what have they done in the rest of the king s provinces,bible-kjv
9 14 and the king commanded it so to be done and the decree was given at shushan and they hanged haman s ten sons,bible-kjv
9 20 and mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the jews that were in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus both nigh and far 9 21 to stablish this among them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month adar and the fifteenth day of the same yearly 9 22 as the days wherein the jews rested from their enemies and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy and from mourning into a good day that they should make them days of feasting and joy and of sending portions one to another and gifts to the poor,bible-kjv
9 30 and he sent the letters unto all the jews to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus with words of peace and truth 9 31 to confirm these days of purim in their times appointed according as mordecai the jew and esther the queen had enjoined them and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed the matters of the fastings and their cry,bible-kjv
the book of job,bible-kjv
1 5 and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in their hearts,bible-kjv
1 8 and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and escheweth evil,bible-kjv
1 12 and the lord said unto satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand,bible-kjv
1 18 while he was yet speaking there came also another and said thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother s house 1 19 and behold there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and they are dead and i only am escaped alone to tell thee,bible-kjv
and satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it,bible-kjv
2 6 and the lord said unto satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life,bible-kjv
2 10 but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh,bible-kjv
2 12 and when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not they lifted up their voice and wept and they rent every one his mantle and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven,bible-kjv
3 5 let darkness and the shadow of death stain it let a cloud dwell upon it let the blackness of the day terrify it,bible-kjv
3 11 why died i not from the womb,bible-kjv
3 17 there the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary be at rest,bible-kjv
3 24 for my sighing cometh before i eat and my roarings are poured out like the waters,bible-kjv
4 3 behold thou hast instructed many and thou hast strengthened the weak hands,bible-kjv
or where were the righteous cut off,bible-kjv
4 12 now a thing was secretly brought to me and mine ear received a little thereof,bible-kjv
4 20 they are destroyed from morning to evening they perish for ever without any regarding it,bible-kjv
5 3 i have seen the foolish taking root but suddenly i cursed his habitation,bible-kjv
5 12 he disappointeth the devices of the crafty so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise,bible-kjv
5 17 behold happy is the man whom god correcteth therefore despise not thou the chastening of the almighty 5 18 for he maketh sore and bindeth up he woundeth and his hands make whole,bible-kjv
5 23 for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee,bible-kjv
6 1 but job answered and said 6 2 oh that my grief were throughly weighed and my calamity laid in the balances together,bible-kjv
6 6 can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt,bible-kjv
6 10 then should i yet have comfort yea i would harden myself in sorrow let him not spare for i have not concealed the words of the holy one,bible-kjv
6 13 is not my help in me,bible-kjv
6 19 the troops of tema looked the companies of sheba waited for them,bible-kjv
6 23 or deliver me from the enemy s hand,bible-kjv
6 26 do ye imagine to reprove words and the speeches of one that is desperate which are as wind,bible-kjv
cannot my taste discern perverse things,bible-kjv
and i am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day,bible-kjv
7 9 as the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more,bible-kjv
7 16 i loathe it i would not live alway let me alone for my days are vanity,bible-kjv
7 20 i have sinned what shall i do unto thee o thou preserver of men,bible-kjv
and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind,bible-kjv
8 8 for enquire i pray thee of the former age and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers 8 9 for we are but of yesterday and know nothing because our days upon earth are a shadow 8 10 shall not they teach thee and tell thee and utter words out of their heart,bible-kjv
8 15 he shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand he shall hold it fast but it shall not endure,bible-kjv
8 20 behold god will not cast away a perfect man neither will he help the evil doers 8 21 till he fill thy mouth with laughing and thy lips with rejoicing,bible-kjv
9 5 which removeth the mountains and they know not which overturneth them in his anger,bible-kjv
9 10 which doeth great things past finding out yea and wonders without number,bible-kjv
9 14 how much less shall i answer him and choose out my words to reason with him,bible-kjv
9 19 if i speak of strength lo he is strong and if of judgment who shall set me a time to plead,bible-kjv
9 24 the earth is given into the hand of the wicked he covereth the faces of the judges thereof if not where and who is he,bible-kjv
9 30 if i wash myself with snow water and make my hands never so clean 9 31 yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor me,bible-kjv
10 2 i will say unto god do not condemn me shew me wherefore thou contendest with me,bible-kjv
are thy years as man s days 10 6 that thou enquirest after mine iniquity and searchest after my sin,bible-kjv
10 11 thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh and hast fenced me with bones and sinews,bible-kjv
i am full of confusion therefore see thou mine affliction 10 16 for it increaseth,bible-kjv
10 19 i should have been as though i had not been i should have been carried from the womb to the grave,bible-kjv
11 3 should thy lies make men hold their peace,bible-kjv
11 7 canst thou by searching find out god,bible-kjv
11 10 if he cut off and shut up or gather together then who can hinder him,bible-kjv
11 18 and thou shalt be secure because there is hope yea thou shalt dig about thee and thou shalt take thy rest in safety,bible-kjv
12 4 i am as one mocked of his neighbour who calleth upon god and he answereth him the just upright man is laughed to scorn,bible-kjv
12 10 in whose hand is the soul of every living thing and the breath of all mankind,bible-kjv
12 14 behold he breaketh down and it cannot be built again he shutteth up a man and there can be no opening,bible-kjv
12 19 he leadeth princes away spoiled and overthroweth the mighty,bible-kjv
12 24 he taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way,bible-kjv
13 4 but ye are forgers of lies ye are all physicians of no value,bible-kjv
and talk deceitfully for him,bible-kjv
13 10 he will surely reprove you if ye do secretly accept persons,bible-kjv
13 14 wherefore do i take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in mine hand,bible-kjv
13 19 who is he that will plead with me,bible-kjv
13 23 how many are mine iniquities and sins,bible-kjv
13 26 for thou writest bitter things against me and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth,bible-kjv
14 3 and doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one and bringest me into judgment with thee,bible-kjv
14 8 though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground 14 9 yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth boughs like a plant,bible-kjv
all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come,bible-kjv
14 19 the waters wear the stones thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth and thou destroyest the hope of man,bible-kjv
15 3 should he reason with unprofitable talk,bible-kjv
15 7 art thou the first man that was born,bible-kjv
what understandest thou which is not in us,bible-kjv
and what do thy eyes wink at 15 13 that thou turnest thy spirit against god and lettest such words go out of thy mouth,bible-kjv
15 17 i will shew thee hear me and that which i have seen i will declare 15 18 which wise men have told from their fathers and have not hid it 15 19 unto whom alone the earth was given and no stranger passed among them,bible-kjv
he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand,bible-kjv
15 29 he shall not be rich neither shall his substance continue neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth,bible-kjv
15 34 for the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery,bible-kjv
16 4 i also could speak as ye do if your soul were in my soul s stead i could heap up words against you and shake mine head at you,bible-kjv
16 9 he teareth me in his wrath who hateth me he gnasheth upon me with his teeth mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me,bible-kjv
16 14 he breaketh me with breach upon breach he runneth upon me like a giant,bible-kjv
16 20 my friends scorn me but mine eye poureth out tears unto god,bible-kjv
and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation,bible-kjv
17 7 mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow and all my members are as a shadow,bible-kjv
17 12 they change the night into day the light is short because of darkness,bible-kjv
17 16 they shall go down to the bars of the pit when our rest together is in the dust,bible-kjv
and shall the rock be removed out of his place,bible-kjv
18 9 the gin shall take him by the heel and the robber shall prevail against him,bible-kjv
18 14 his confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle and it shall bring him to the king of terrors,bible-kjv
18 19 he shall neither have son nor nephew among his people nor any remaining in his dwellings,bible-kjv
19 4 and be it indeed that i have erred mine error remaineth with myself,bible-kjv
19 10 he hath destroyed me on every side and i am gone and mine hope hath he removed like a tree,bible-kjv
19 15 they that dwell in mine house and my maids count me for a stranger i am an alien in their sight,bible-kjv
19 20 my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh and i am escaped with the skin of my teeth,bible-kjv
19 24 that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever,bible-kjv
20 3 i have heard the check of my reproach and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer,bible-kjv
20 10 his children shall seek to please the poor and his hands shall restore their goods,bible-kjv
20 17 he shall not see the rivers the floods the brooks of honey and butter,bible-kjv
20 23 when he is about to fill his belly god shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him and shall rain it upon him while he is eating,bible-kjv
20 28 the increase of his house shall depart and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath,bible-kjv
and if it were so why should not my spirit be troubled,bible-kjv
21 9 their houses are safe from fear neither is the rod of god upon them,bible-kjv
21 14 therefore they say unto god depart from us for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways,bible-kjv
and how oft cometh their destruction upon them,bible-kjv
21 21 for what pleasure hath he in his house after him when the number of his months is cut off in the midst,bible-kjv
21 25 and another dieth in the bitterness of his soul and never eateth with pleasure,bible-kjv
21 29 have ye not asked them that go by the way,bible-kjv
21 32 yet shall he be brought to the grave and shall remain in the tomb,bible-kjv
or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect,bible-kjv
22 6 for thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought and stripped the naked of their clothing,bible-kjv
22 12 is not god in the height of heaven,bible-kjv
22 15 hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden,bible-kjv
22 21 acquaint now thyself with him and be at peace thereby good shall come unto thee,bible-kjv
22 26 for then shalt thou have thy delight in the almighty and shalt lift up thy face unto god,bible-kjv
23 1 then job answered and said 23 2 even to day is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning,bible-kjv
23 6 will he plead against me with his great power,bible-kjv
23 12 neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips i have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food,bible-kjv
23 16 for god maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me 23 17 because i was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he covered the darkness from my face,bible-kjv
24 5 behold as wild asses in the desert go they forth to their work rising betimes for a prey the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children,bible-kjv
24 10 they cause him to go naked without clothing and they take away the sheaf from the hungry 24 11 which make oil within their walls and tread their winepresses and suffer thirst,bible-kjv
24 16 in the dark they dig through houses which they had marked for themselves in the daytime they know not the light,bible-kjv
24 21 he evil entreateth the barren that beareth not and doeth not good to the widow,bible-kjv
25 1 then answered bildad the shuhite and said 25 2 dominion and fear are with him he maketh peace in his high places,bible-kjv
25 5 behold even to the moon and it shineth not yea the stars are not pure in his sight,bible-kjv
26 3 how hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom,bible-kjv
26 6 hell is naked before him and destruction hath no covering,bible-kjv
26 11 the pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof,bible-kjv
27 1 moreover job continued his parable and said 27 2 as god liveth who hath taken away my judgment and the almighty who hath vexed my soul 27 3 all the while my breath is in me and the spirit of god is in my nostrils 27 4 my lips shall not speak wickedness nor my tongue utter deceit,bible-kjv
27 9 will god hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him,bible-kjv
27 13 this is the portion of a wicked man with god and the heritage of oppressors which they shall receive of the almighty,bible-kjv
27 19 the rich man shall lie down but he shall not be gathered he openeth his eyes and he is not,bible-kjv
28 1 surely there is a vein for the silver and a place for gold where they fine it,bible-kjv
28 6 the stones of it are the place of sapphires and it hath dust of gold,bible-kjv
28 12 but where shall wisdom be found,bible-kjv
28 16 it cannot be valued with the gold of ophir with the precious onyx or the sapphire,bible-kjv
and where is the place of understanding,bible-kjv
28 26 when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder 28 27 then did he see it and declare it he prepared it yea and searched it out,bible-kjv
29 10 the nobles held their peace and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth,bible-kjv
29 16 i was a father to the poor and the cause which i knew not i searched out,bible-kjv
29 21 unto me men gave ear and waited and kept silence at my counsel,bible-kjv
30 1 but now they that are younger than i have me in derision whose fathers i would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock,bible-kjv
30 7 among the bushes they brayed under the nettles they were gathered together,bible-kjv
30 12 upon my right hand rise the youth they push away my feet and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction,bible-kjv
30 17 my bones are pierced in me in the night season and my sinews take no rest,bible-kjv
30 22 thou liftest me up to the wind thou causest me to ride upon it and dissolvest my substance,bible-kjv
30 26 when i looked for good then evil came unto me and when i waited for light there came darkness,bible-kjv
30 31 my harp also is turned to mourning and my organ into the voice of them that weep,bible-kjv
and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity,bible-kjv
31 11 for this is an heinous crime yea it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges,bible-kjv
and did not one fashion us in the womb,bible-kjv
31 31 if the men of my tabernacle said not oh that we had of his flesh,bible-kjv
behold my desire is that the almighty would answer me and that mine adversary had written a book,bible-kjv
32 1 so these three men ceased to answer job because he was righteous in his own eyes,bible-kjv
32 6 and elihu the son of barachel the buzite answered and said i am young and ye are very old wherefore i was afraid and durst not shew you mine opinion,bible-kjv
32 11 behold i waited for your words i gave ear to your reasons whilst ye searched out what to say,bible-kjv
32 18 for i am full of matter the spirit within me constraineth me,bible-kjv
33 1 wherefore job i pray thee hear my speeches and hearken to all my words,bible-kjv
33 6 behold i am according to thy wish in god s stead i also am formed out of the clay,bible-kjv
33 13 why dost thou strive against him,bible-kjv
33 19 he is chastened also with pain upon his bed and the multitude of his bones with strong pain 33 20 so that his life abhorreth bread and his soul dainty meat,bible-kjv
33 27 he looketh upon men and if any say i have sinned and perverted that which was right and it profited me not 33 28 he will deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see the light,bible-kjv
34 1 furthermore elihu answered and said 34 2 hear my words o ye wise men and give ear unto me ye that have knowledge,bible-kjv
my wound is incurable without transgression,bible-kjv
34 11 for the work of a man shall he render unto him and cause every man to find according to his ways,bible-kjv
34 16 if now thou hast understanding hear this hearken to the voice of my words,bible-kjv
34 19 how much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes nor regardeth the rich more than the poor,bible-kjv
34 23 for he will not lay upon man more than right that he should enter into judgment with god,bible-kjv
and when he hideth his face who then can behold him,bible-kjv
34 34 let men of understanding tell me and let a wise man hearken unto me,bible-kjv
35 3 for thou saidst what advantage will it be unto thee,bible-kjv
or if thy transgressions be multiplied what doest thou unto him,bible-kjv
35 10 but none saith where is god my maker who giveth songs in the night 35 11 who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven,bible-kjv
36 1 elihu also proceeded and said 36 2 suffer me a little and i will shew thee that i have yet to speak on god s behalf,bible-kjv
36 7 he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous but with kings are they on the throne yea he doth establish them for ever and they are exalted,bible-kjv
36 13 but the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath they cry not when he bindeth them,bible-kjv
36 18 because there is wrath beware lest he take thee away with his stroke then a great ransom cannot deliver thee,bible-kjv
36 22 behold god exalteth by his power who teacheth like him,bible-kjv
36 26 behold god is great and we know him not neither can the number of his years be searched out,bible-kjv
36 32 with clouds he covereth the light and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt,bible-kjv
37 4 after it a voice roareth he thundereth with the voice of his excellency and he will not stay them when his voice is heard,bible-kjv
37 9 out of the south cometh the whirlwind and cold out of the north,bible-kjv
37 15 dost thou know when god disposed them and caused the light of his cloud to shine,bible-kjv
37 20 shall it be told him that i speak,bible-kjv
37 24 men do therefore fear him he respecteth not any that are wise of heart,bible-kjv
38 5 who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest,bible-kjv
38 9 when i made the cloud the garment thereof and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it 38 10 and brake up for it my decreed place and set bars and doors 38 11 and said hitherto shalt thou come but no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayed,bible-kjv
or hast thou walked in the search of the depth,bible-kjv
38 19 where is the way where light dwelleth,bible-kjv
or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail 38 23 which i have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war,bible-kjv
38 29 out of whose womb came the ice,bible-kjv
or canst thou guide arcturus with his sons,bible-kjv
38 36 who hath put wisdom in the inward parts,bible-kjv
or fill the appetite of the young lions 38 40 when they couch in their dens and abide in the covert to lie in wait,bible-kjv
39 2 canst thou number the months that they fulfil,bible-kjv
or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass,bible-kjv
39 10 canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow,bible-kjv
39 13 gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks,bible-kjv
39 19 hast thou given the horse strength,bible-kjv
39 22 he mocketh at fear and is not affrighted neither turneth he back from the sword,bible-kjv
39 27 doth the eagle mount up at thy command and make her nest on high,bible-kjv
he that reproveth god let him answer it,bible-kjv
40 8 wilt thou also disannul my judgment,bible-kjv
40 11 cast abroad the rage of thy wrath and behold every one that is proud and abase him,bible-kjv
40 16 lo now his strength is in his loins and his force is in the navel of his belly,bible-kjv
40 21 he lieth under the shady trees in the covert of the reed and fens,bible-kjv
or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down,bible-kjv
41 4 will he make a covenant with thee,bible-kjv
shall they part him among the merchants,bible-kjv
41 10 none is so fierce that dare stir him up who then is able to stand before me,bible-kjv
or who can come to him with his double bridle,bible-kjv
41 17 they are joined one to another they stick together that they cannot be sundered,bible-kjv
41 22 in his neck remaineth strength and sorrow is turned into joy before him,bible-kjv
41 27 he esteemeth iron as straw and brass as rotten wood,bible-kjv
41 32 he maketh a path to shine after him one would think the deep to be hoary,bible-kjv
therefore have i uttered that i understood not things too wonderful for me which i knew not,bible-kjv
42 8 therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams and go to my servant job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering and my servant job shall pray for you for him will i accept lest i deal with you after your folly in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right like my servant job,bible-kjv
42 13 he had also seven sons and three daughters,bible-kjv
the book of psalms,bible-kjv
1 5 therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous,bible-kjv
2 4 he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the lord shall have them in derision,bible-kjv
2 9 thou shalt break them with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter s vessel,bible-kjv
3 1 lord how are they increased that trouble me,bible-kjv
3 4 i cried unto the lord with my voice and he heard me out of his holy hill,bible-kjv
3 8 salvation belongeth unto the lord thy blessing is upon thy people,bible-kjv
selah,bible-kjv
4 6 there be many that say who will shew us any good,bible-kjv
5 2 hearken unto the voice of my cry my king and my god for unto thee will i pray,bible-kjv
5 7 but as for me i will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy and in thy fear will i worship toward thy holy temple,bible-kjv
5 12 for thou lord wilt bless the righteous with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield,bible-kjv
6 5 for in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who shall give thee thanks,bible-kjv
6 10 let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed let them return and be ashamed suddenly,bible-kjv
7 5 let the enemy persecute my soul and take it yea let him tread down my life upon the earth and lay mine honour in the dust,bible-kjv
7 9 oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end but establish the just for the righteous god trieth the hearts and reins,bible-kjv
7 14 behold he travaileth with iniquity and hath conceived mischief and brought forth falsehood,bible-kjv
who hast set thy glory above the heavens,bible-kjv
8 5 for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and honour,bible-kjv
9 1 i will praise thee o lord with my whole heart i will shew forth all thy marvellous works,bible-kjv
9 6 o thou enemy destructions are come to a perpetual end and thou hast destroyed cities their memorial is perished with them,bible-kjv
9 11 sing praises to the lord which dwelleth in zion declare among the people his doings,bible-kjv
9 16 the lord is known by the judgment which he executeth the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands,bible-kjv
9 19 arise o lord let not man prevail let the heathen be judged in thy sight,bible-kjv
10 2 the wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined,bible-kjv
10 7 his mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud under his tongue is mischief and vanity,bible-kjv
10 12 arise o lord o god lift up thine hand forget not the humble,bible-kjv
10 16 the lord is king for ever and ever the heathen are perished out of his land,bible-kjv
11 3 if the foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do,bible-kjv
12 1 help lord for the godly man ceaseth for the faithful fail from among the children of men,bible-kjv
12 6 the words of the lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of earth purified seven times,bible-kjv
how long wilt thou hide thy face from me,bible-kjv
13 5 but i have trusted in thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation,bible-kjv
14 3 they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one,bible-kjv
14 7 oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion,bible-kjv
15 3 he that backbiteth not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his neighbour nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour,bible-kjv
16 1 preserve me o god for in thee do i put my trust,bible-kjv
16 6 the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places yea i have a goodly heritage,bible-kjv
16 11 thou wilt shew me the path of life in thy presence is fulness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore,bible-kjv
17 5 hold up my goings in thy paths that my footsteps slip not,bible-kjv
17 10 they are inclosed in their own fat with their mouth they speak proudly,bible-kjv
17 15 as for me i will behold thy face in righteousness i shall be satisfied when i awake with thy likeness,bible-kjv

50 21 these things hast thou done and i kept silence thou thoughtest that i was altogether such an one as thyself but i will reprove thee and set them in order before thine eyes,bible-kjv

corrupt are they and have done abominable iniquity there is none that doeth good,bible-kjv
53 5 there were they in great fear where no fear was for god hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee thou hast put them to shame because god hath despised them,bible-kjv
54 3 for strangers are risen up against me and oppressors seek after my soul they have not set god before them,bible-kjv
54 7 for he hath delivered me out of all trouble and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies,bible-kjv
55 5 fearfulness and trembling are come upon me and horror hath overwhelmed me,bible-kjv
55 8 i would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest,bible-kjv
55 13 but it was thou a man mine equal my guide and mine acquaintance,bible-kjv
55 18 he hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me for there were many with me,bible-kjv
55 21 the words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in his heart his words were softer than oil yet were they drawn swords,bible-kjv

62 8 trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us,bible-kjv
62 12 also unto thee o lord belongeth mercy for thou renderest to every man according to his work,bible-kjv
63 5 my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips,bible-kjv

68 18 thou hast ascended on high thou hast led captivity captive thou hast received gifts for men yea for the rebellious also that the lord god might dwell among them,bible-kjv
68 22 the lord said i will bring again from bashan i will bring my people again from the depths of the sea,bible-kjv
68 27 there is little benjamin with their ruler the princes of judah and their council the princes of zebulun and the princes of naphtali,bible-kjv
68 32 sing unto god ye kingdoms of the earth o sing praises unto the lord selah,bible-kjv
69 1 save me o god for the waters are come in unto my soul,bible-kjv
69 6 let not them that wait on thee o lord god of hosts be ashamed for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake o god of israel,bible-kjv
69 11 i made sackcloth also my garment and i became a proverb to them,bible-kjv
69 16 hear me o lord for thy lovingkindness is good turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies,bible-kjv
69 21 they gave me also gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink,bible-kjv
69 26 for they persecute him whom thou hast smitten and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded,bible-kjv
69 31 this also shall please the lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs,bible-kjv
69 36 the seed also of his servants shall inherit it and they that love his name shall dwell therein,bible-kjv
70 5 but i am poor and needy make haste unto me o god thou art my help and my deliverer o lord make no tarrying,bible-kjv
71 5 for thou art my hope o lord god thou art my trust from my youth,bible-kjv
71 10 for mine enemies speak against me and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,bible-kjv
71 15 my mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day for i know not the numbers thereof,bible-kjv
71 20 thou which hast shewed me great and sore troubles shalt quicken me again and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth,bible-kjv
72 1 give the king thy judgments o god and thy righteousness unto the king s son,bible-kjv
72 6 he shall come down like rain upon the mown grass as showers that water the earth,bible-kjv
72 11 yea all kings shall fall down before him all nations shall serve him,bible-kjv
72 16 there shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains the fruit thereof shall shake like lebanon and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth,bible-kjv
73 1 truly god is good to israel even to such as are of a clean heart,bible-kjv
73 6 therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain violence covereth them as a garment,bible-kjv
73 11 and they say how doth god know,bible-kjv
73 15 if i say i will speak thus behold i should offend against the generation of thy children,bible-kjv
they are utterly consumed with terrors,bible-kjv
73 24 thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to glory,bible-kjv
73 28 but it is good for me to draw near to god i have put my trust in the lord god that i may declare all thy works,bible-kjv
74 4 thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations they set up their ensigns for signs,bible-kjv
74 9 we see not our signs there is no more any prophet neither is there among us any that knoweth how long,bible-kjv
74 12 for god is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the earth,bible-kjv
74 17 thou hast set all the borders of the earth thou hast made summer and winter,bible-kjv
74 22 arise o god plead thine own cause remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily,bible-kjv
selah,bible-kjv
75 8 for in the hand of the lord there is a cup and the wine is red it is full of mixture and he poureth out of the same but the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out and drink them,bible-kjv
76 3 there brake he the arrows of the bow the shield and the sword and the battle,bible-kjv
76 7 thou even thou art to be feared and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry,bible-kjv
76 11 vow and pay unto the lord your god let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared,bible-kjv

and will he be favourable no more,bible-kjv
selah,bible-kjv
77 14 thou art the god that doest wonders thou hast declared thy strength among the people,bible-kjv
77 18 the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven the lightnings lightened the world the earth trembled and shook,bible-kjv
78 3 which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us,bible-kjv
78 8 and might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious generation a generation that set not their heart aright and whose spirit was not stedfast with god,bible-kjv
78 13 he divided the sea and caused them to pass through and he made the waters to stand as an heap,bible-kjv
78 18 and they tempted god in their heart by asking meat for their lust,bible-kjv
78 22 because they believed not in god and trusted not in his salvation,bible-kjv
78 27 he rained flesh also upon them as dust and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea,bible-kjv
78 31 the wrath of god came upon them and slew the fattest of them and smote down the chosen men of israel,bible-kjv
78 36 nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth and they lied unto him with their tongues,bible-kjv
78 41 yea they turned back and tempted god and limited the holy one of israel,bible-kjv
78 46 he gave also their increase unto the caterpiller and their labour unto the locust,bible-kjv
78 51 and smote all the firstborn in egypt the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of ham,bible-kjv
78 56 yet they tempted and provoked the most high god and kept not his testimonies,bible-kjv
78 61 and delivered his strength into captivity and his glory into the enemy s hand,bible-kjv
78 66 and he smote his enemies in the hinder parts he put them to a perpetual reproach,bible-kjv
78 71 from following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed jacob his people and israel his inheritance,bible-kjv
79 4 we are become a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and derision to them that are round about us,bible-kjv
79 7 for they have devoured jacob and laid waste his dwelling place,bible-kjv
79 11 let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die,bible-kjv
80 3 turn us again o god and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved,bible-kjv
80 8 thou hast brought a vine out of egypt thou hast cast out the heathen and planted it,bible-kjv
80 13 the boar out of the wood doth waste it and the wild beast of the field doth devour it,bible-kjv
80 18 so will not we go back from thee quicken us and we will call upon thy name,bible-kjv
81 4 for this was a statute for israel and a law of the god of jacob,bible-kjv
81 8 hear o my people and i will testify unto thee o israel if thou wilt hearken unto me,bible-kjv
81 13 oh that my people had hearkened unto me and israel had walked in my ways,bible-kjv
82 2 how long will ye judge unjustly and accept the persons of the wicked,bible-kjv
82 6 i have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high,bible-kjv
83 3 they have taken crafty counsel against thy people and consulted against thy hidden ones,bible-kjv
83 8 assur also is joined with them they have holpen the children of lot,bible-kjv
83 12 who said let us take to ourselves the houses of god in possession,bible-kjv
83 17 let them be confounded and troubled for ever yea let them be put to shame and perish,bible-kjv
84 4 blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee,bible-kjv
84 8 o lord god of hosts hear my prayer give ear o god of jacob,bible-kjv
84 11 for the lord god is a sun and shield the lord will give grace and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly,bible-kjv

85 7 shew us thy mercy o lord and grant us thy salvation,bible-kjv
85 12 yea the lord shall give that which is good and our land shall yield her increase,bible-kjv
86 4 rejoice the soul of thy servant for unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul,bible-kjv
86 9 all nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee o lord and shall glorify thy name,bible-kjv
86 14 o god the proud are risen against me and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul and have not set thee before them,bible-kjv
87 2 the lord loveth the gates of zion more than all the dwellings of jacob,bible-kjv
87 6 the lord shall count when he writeth up the people that this man was born there,bible-kjv
88 3 for my soul is full of troubles and my life draweth nigh unto the grave,bible-kjv
selah,bible-kjv

88 13 but unto thee have i cried o lord and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee,bible-kjv
88 17 they came round about me daily like water they compassed me about together,bible-kjv
89 4 thy seed will i establish for ever and build up thy throne to all generations,bible-kjv
89 7 god is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him,bible-kjv
89 11 the heavens are thine the earth also is thine as for the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded them,bible-kjv
89 16 in thy name shall they rejoice all the day and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted,bible-kjv
89 21 with whom my hand shall be established mine arm also shall strengthen him,bible-kjv
89 26 he shall cry unto me thou art my father my god and the rock of my salvation,bible-kjv
89 31 if they break my statutes and keep not my commandments,bible-kjv
89 36 his seed shall endure for ever and his throne as the sun before me,bible-kjv
89 40 thou hast broken down all his hedges thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin,bible-kjv

12 14 a man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth and the recompence of a man s hands shall be rendered unto him,bible-kjv
12 19 the lip of truth shall be established for ever but a lying tongue is but for a moment,bible-kjv
12 24 the hand of the diligent shall bear rule but the slothful shall be under tribute,bible-kjv
13 1 a wise son heareth his father s instruction but a scorner heareth not rebuke,bible-kjv
13 6 righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way but wickedness overthroweth the sinner,bible-kjv
13 11 wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished but he that gathereth by labour shall increase,bible-kjv
13 16 every prudent man dealeth with knowledge but a fool layeth open his folly,bible-kjv
13 21 evil pursueth sinners but to the righteous good shall be repayed,bible-kjv
14 1 every wise woman buildeth her house but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands,bible-kjv
14 6 a scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth,bible-kjv
14 11 the house of the wicked shall be overthrown but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish,bible-kjv
14 16 a wise man feareth and departeth from evil but the fool rageth and is confident,bible-kjv
14 21 he that despiseth his neighbour sinneth but he that hath mercy on the poor happy is he,bible-kjv
14 25 a true witness delivereth souls but a deceitful witness speaketh lies,bible-kjv
14 30 a sound heart is the life of the flesh but envy the rottenness of the bones,bible-kjv
14 35 the king s favour is toward a wise servant but his wrath is against him that causeth shame,bible-kjv
15 5 a fool despiseth his father s instruction but he that regardeth reproof is prudent,bible-kjv
15 10 correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way and he that hateth reproof shall die,bible-kjv
15 15 all the days of the afflicted are evil but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast,bible-kjv
15 20 a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish man despiseth his mother,bible-kjv
15 25 the lord will destroy the house of the proud but he will establish the border of the widow,bible-kjv
15 30 the light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart and a good report maketh the bones fat,bible-kjv
16 2 all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes but the lord weigheth the spirits,bible-kjv
16 7 when a man s ways please the lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him,bible-kjv
16 12 it is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness for the throne is established by righteousness,bible-kjv
and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver,bible-kjv
16 21 the wise in heart shall be called prudent and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning,bible-kjv
16 26 he that laboureth laboureth for himself for his mouth craveth it of him,bible-kjv
16 31 the hoary head is a crown of glory if it be found in the way of righteousness,bible-kjv
17 3 the fining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold but the lord trieth the hearts,bible-kjv
17 8 a gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it whithersoever it turneth it prospereth,bible-kjv
17 13 whoso rewardeth evil for good evil shall not depart from his house,bible-kjv
17 18 a man void of understanding striketh hands and becometh surety in the presence of his friend,bible-kjv
17 23 a wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment,bible-kjv
17 28 even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding,bible-kjv
18 5 it is not good to accept the person of the wicked to overthrow the righteous in judgment,bible-kjv
18 10 the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is safe,bible-kjv
18 15 the heart of the prudent getteth knowledge and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge,bible-kjv
18 20 a man s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled,bible-kjv
19 1 better is the poor that walketh in his integrity than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool,bible-kjv
19 6 many will intreat the favour of the prince and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts,bible-kjv
19 10 delight is not seemly for a fool much less for a servant to have rule over princes,bible-kjv
19 15 slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep and an idle soul shall suffer hunger,bible-kjv
19 20 hear counsel and receive instruction that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end,bible-kjv
19 25 smite a scorner and the simple will beware and reprove one that hath understanding and he will understand knowledge,bible-kjv
20 1 wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise,bible-kjv
20 6 most men will proclaim every one his own goodness but a faithful man who can find,bible-kjv
20 11 even a child is known by his doings whether his work be pure and whether it be right,bible-kjv
20 16 take his garment that is surety for a stranger and take a pledge of him for a strange woman,bible-kjv
20 21 an inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning but the end thereof shall not be blessed,bible-kjv
20 26 a wise king scattereth the wicked and bringeth the wheel over them,bible-kjv
21 1 the king s heart is in the hand of the lord as the rivers of water he turneth it whithersoever he will,bible-kjv
21 6 the getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death,bible-kjv
21 11 when the scorner is punished the simple is made wise and when the wise is instructed he receiveth knowledge,bible-kjv
21 16 the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead,bible-kjv
21 21 he that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life righteousness and honour,bible-kjv
21 26 he coveteth greedily all the day long but the righteous giveth and spareth not,bible-kjv
21 31 the horse is prepared against the day of battle but safety is of the lord,bible-kjv
22 5 thorns and snares are in the way of the froward he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them,bible-kjv
22 10 cast out the scorner and contention shall go out yea strife and reproach shall cease,bible-kjv
22 15 foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him,bible-kjv
22 20 have not i written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge 22 21 that i might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee,bible-kjv
22 28 remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set,bible-kjv
23 4 labour not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom,bible-kjv
23 9 speak not in the ears of a fool for he will despise the wisdom of thy words,bible-kjv
23 15 my son if thine heart be wise my heart shall rejoice even mine,bible-kjv
23 20 be not among winebibbers among riotous eaters of flesh 23 21 for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags,bible-kjv
23 26 my son give me thine heart and let thine eyes observe my ways,bible-kjv
who hath contentions,bible-kjv
23 31 look not thou upon the wine when it is red when it giveth his colour in the cup when it moveth itself aright,bible-kjv
i will seek it yet again,bible-kjv
24 6 for by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war and in multitude of counsellors there is safety,bible-kjv
24 11 if thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death and those that are ready to be slain 24 12 if thou sayest behold we knew it not doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it,bible-kjv
24 17 rejoice not when thine enemy falleth and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth 24 18 lest the lord see it and it displease him and he turn away his wrath from him,bible-kjv
24 24 he that saith unto the wicked thou are righteous him shall the people curse nations shall abhor him 24 25 but to them that rebuke him shall be delight and a good blessing shall come upon them,bible-kjv
24 30 i went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding 24 31 and lo it was all grown over with thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down,bible-kjv
25 3 the heaven for height and the earth for depth and the heart of kings is unsearchable,bible-kjv
25 9 debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself and discover not a secret to another 25 10 lest he that heareth it put thee to shame and thine infamy turn not away,bible-kjv
25 15 by long forbearing is a prince persuaded and a soft tongue breaketh the bone,bible-kjv
25 19 confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth and a foot out of joint,bible-kjv
25 25 as cold waters to a thirsty soul so is good news from a far country,bible-kjv
26 2 as the bird by wandering as the swallow by flying so the curse causeless shall not come,bible-kjv
26 7 the legs of the lame are not equal so is a parable in the mouth of fools,bible-kjv
26 12 seest thou a man wise in his own conceit,bible-kjv
26 16 the sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason,bible-kjv
26 22 the words of a talebearer are as wounds and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly,bible-kjv
26 28 a lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it and a flattering mouth worketh ruin,bible-kjv
27 5 open rebuke is better than secret love,bible-kjv
27 10 thine own friend and thy father s friend forsake not neither go into thy brother s house in the day of thy calamity for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off,bible-kjv
27 15 a continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike,bible-kjv
27 20 hell and destruction are never full so the eyes of man are never satisfied,bible-kjv
27 25 the hay appeareth and the tender grass sheweth itself and herbs of the mountains are gathered,bible-kjv
28 3 a poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food,bible-kjv
28 8 he that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor,bible-kjv
28 13 he that covereth his sins shall not prosper but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy,bible-kjv
28 18 whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once,bible-kjv
28 23 he that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue,bible-kjv
28 28 when the wicked rise men hide themselves but when they perish the righteous increase,bible-kjv
29 5 a man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet,bible-kjv
29 10 the bloodthirsty hate the upright but the just seek his soul,bible-kjv
29 15 the rod and reproof give wisdom but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame,bible-kjv
29 20 seest thou a man that is hasty in his words,bible-kjv
29 24 whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul he heareth cursing and bewrayeth it not,bible-kjv
30 3 i neither learned wisdom nor have the knowledge of the holy,bible-kjv
what is his name and what is his son s name if thou canst tell,bible-kjv
30 10 accuse not a servant unto his master lest he curse thee and thou be found guilty,bible-kjv
30 14 there is a generation whose teeth are as swords and their jaw teeth as knives to devour the poor from off the earth and the needy from among men,bible-kjv
30 20 such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith i have done no wickedness,bible-kjv
30 33 surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife,bible-kjv
31 3 give not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings,bible-kjv
31 9 open thy mouth judge righteously and plead the cause of the poor and needy,bible-kjv
31 13 she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands,bible-kjv
31 18 she perceiveth that her merchandise is good her candle goeth not out by night,bible-kjv
31 23 her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land,bible-kjv
31 28 her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her,bible-kjv
or,bible-kjv
1 4 one generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth for ever,bible-kjv
1 9 the thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun,bible-kjv
1 13 and i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven this sore travail hath god given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith,bible-kjv
1 18 for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow,bible-kjv
2 9 so i was great and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me,bible-kjv
2 13 then i saw that wisdom excelleth folly as far as light excelleth darkness,bible-kjv
and how dieth the wise man,bible-kjv
yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein i have laboured and wherein i have shewed myself wise under the sun,bible-kjv
2 22 for what hath man of all his labour and of the vexation of his heart wherein he hath laboured under the sun,bible-kjv
2 25 for who can eat or who else can hasten hereunto more than i,bible-kjv
3 10 i have seen the travail which god hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it,bible-kjv
3 15 that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and god requireth that which is past,bible-kjv
3 20 all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again,bible-kjv
4 3 yea better is he than both they which hath not yet been who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun,bible-kjv
4 7 then i returned and i saw vanity under the sun,bible-kjv
4 11 again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warm alone,bible-kjv
4 16 there is no end of all the people even of all that have been before them they also that come after shall not rejoice in him,bible-kjv
5 4 when thou vowest a vow unto god defer not to pay it for he hath no pleasure in fools pay that which thou hast vowed,bible-kjv
5 9 moreover the profit of the earth is for all the king himself is served by the field,bible-kjv
5 14 but those riches perish by evil travail and he begetteth a son and there is nothing in his hand,bible-kjv
5 19 every man also to whom god hath given riches and wealth and hath given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour this is the gift of god,bible-kjv
6 5 moreover he hath not seen the sun nor known any thing this hath more rest than the other,bible-kjv
6 9 better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire this is also vanity and vexation of spirit,bible-kjv
7 1 a good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one s birth,bible-kjv
7 6 for as the crackling of thorns under a pot so is the laughter of the fool this also is vanity,bible-kjv
for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this,bible-kjv
7 15 all things have i seen in the days of my vanity there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness,bible-kjv
7 20 for there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not,bible-kjv
7 27 behold this have i found saith the preacher counting one by one to find out the account 7 28 which yet my soul seeketh but i find not one man among a thousand have i found but a woman among all those have i not found,bible-kjv
8 2 i counsel thee to keep the king s commandment and that in regard of the oath of god,bible-kjv
8 7 for he knoweth not that which shall be for who can tell him when it shall be,bible-kjv
8 12 though a sinner do evil an hundred times and his days be prolonged yet surely i know that it shall be well with them that fear god which fear before him 8 13 but it shall not be well with the wicked neither shall he prolong his days which are as a shadow because he feareth not before god,bible-kjv
9 2 all things come alike to all there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked to the good and to the clean and to the unclean to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not as is the good so is the sinner and he that sweareth as he that feareth an oath,bible-kjv
9 7 go thy way eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry heart for god now accepteth thy works,bible-kjv
9 12 for man also knoweth not his time as the fishes that are taken in an evil net and as the birds that are caught in the snare so are the sons of men snared in an evil time when it falleth suddenly upon them,bible-kjv
10 1 dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour,bible-kjv
10 7 i have seen servants upon horses and princes walking as servants upon the earth,bible-kjv
10 12 the words of a wise man s mouth are gracious but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself,bible-kjv
10 17 blessed art thou o land when thy king is the son of nobles and thy princes eat in due season for strength and not for drunkenness,bible-kjv
11 2 give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth,bible-kjv
11 7 truly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun 11 8 but if a man live many years and rejoice in them all yet let him remember the days of darkness for they shall be many,bible-kjv
12 7 then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it,bible-kjv
12 12 and further by these my son be admonished of making many books there is no end and much study is a weariness of the flesh,bible-kjv
1 2 let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love is better than wine,bible-kjv
1 7 tell me o thou whom my soul loveth where thou feedest where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon for why should i be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions,bible-kjv
1 12 while the king sitteth at his table my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof,bible-kjv
1 17 the beams of our house are cedar and our rafters of fir,bible-kjv
2 4 he brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was love,bible-kjv
behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills,bible-kjv
2 14 o my dove that art in the clefts of the rock in the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely,bible-kjv
3 2 i will rise now and go about the city in the streets and in the broad ways i will seek him whom my soul loveth i sought him but i found him not,bible-kjv
3 7 behold his bed which is solomon s threescore valiant men are about it of the valiant of israel,bible-kjv
4 1 behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thou hast doves eyes within thy locks thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from mount gilead,bible-kjv
4 6 until the day break and the shadows flee away i will get me to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense,bible-kjv
how much better is thy love than wine,bible-kjv
4 16 awake o north wind and come thou south blow upon my garden that the spices thereof may flow out,bible-kjv
i have washed my feet how shall i defile them,bible-kjv
5 8 i charge you o daughters of jerusalem if ye find my beloved that ye tell him that i am sick of love,bible-kjv
5 12 his eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters washed with milk and fitly set,bible-kjv
this is my beloved and this is my friend o daughters of jerusalem,bible-kjv
6 3 i am my beloved s and my beloved is mine he feedeth among the lilies,bible-kjv
6 8 there are threescore queens and fourscore concubines and virgins without number,bible-kjv
6 12 or ever i was aware my soul made me like the chariots of amminadib,bible-kjv
the joints of thy thighs are like jewels the work of the hands of a cunning workman,bible-kjv
7 6 how fair and how pleasant art thou o love for delights,bible-kjv
7 12 let us get up early to the vineyards let us see if the vine flourish whether the tender grape appear and the pomegranates bud forth there will i give thee my loves,bible-kjv
8 3 his left hand should be under my head and his right hand should embrace me,bible-kjv
8 7 many waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would utterly be contemned,bible-kjv
8 12 my vineyard which is mine is before me thou o solomon must have a thousand and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred,bible-kjv
1 2 hear o heavens and give ear o earth for the lord hath spoken i have nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against me,bible-kjv
1 6 from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it but wounds and bruises and putrifying sores they have not been closed neither bound up neither mollified with ointment,bible-kjv
1 11 to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me,bible-kjv
1 15 and when ye spread forth your hands i will hide mine eyes from you yea when ye make many prayers i will not hear your hands are full of blood,bible-kjv
it was full of judgment righteousness lodged in it but now murderers,bible-kjv
1 29 for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen,bible-kjv
2 3 and many people shall go and say come ye and let us go up to the mountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for out of zion shall go forth the law and the word of the lord from jerusalem,bible-kjv
2 10 enter into the rock and hide thee in the dust for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty,bible-kjv
2 19 and they shall go into the holes of the rocks and into the caves of the earth for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth,bible-kjv
3 4 and i will give children to be their princes and babes shall rule over them,bible-kjv
woe unto their soul,bible-kjv
3 12 as for my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them,bible-kjv
saith the lord god of hosts,bible-kjv
3 26 and her gates shall lament and mourn and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground,bible-kjv
4 6 and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain,bible-kjv
wherefore when i looked that it should bring forth grapes brought it forth wild grapes,bible-kjv
5 10 yea ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah,bible-kjv
5 15 and the mean man shall be brought down and the mighty man shall be humbled and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled 5 16 but the lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment and god that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness,bible-kjv
5 22 woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink 5 23 which justify the wicked for reward and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him,bible-kjv
5 30 and in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea and if one look unto the land behold darkness and sorrow and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof,bible-kjv
6 5 then said i woe is me,bible-kjv
6 9 and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed but understand not and see ye indeed but perceive not,bible-kjv
7 1 and it came to pass in the days of ahaz the son of jotham the son of uzziah king of judah that rezin the king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah king of israel went up toward jerusalem to war against it but could not prevail against it,bible-kjv
7 8 for the head of syria is damascus and the head of damascus is rezin and within threescore and five years shall ephraim be broken that it be not a people,bible-kjv
7 13 and he said hear ye now o house of david is it a small thing for you to weary men but will ye weary my god also,bible-kjv
7 18 and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of egypt and for the bee that is in the land of assyria,bible-kjv
7 24 with arrows and with bows shall men come thither because all the land shall become briers and thorns,bible-kjv
then said the lord to me call his name mahershalalhashbaz,bible-kjv
8 11 for the lord spake thus to me with a strong hand and instructed me that i should not walk in the way of this people saying 8 12 say ye not a confederacy to all them to whom this people shall say a confederacy neither fear ye their fear nor be afraid,bible-kjv
8 17 and i will wait upon the lord that hideth his face from the house of jacob and i will look for him,bible-kjv
8 21 and they shall pass through it hardly bestead and hungry and it shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry they shall fret themselves and curse their king and their god and look upward,bible-kjv
9 4 for thou hast broken the yoke of his burden and the staff of his shoulder the rod of his oppressor as in the day of midian,bible-kjv
9 8 the lord sent a word into jacob and it hath lighted upon israel,bible-kjv
9 14 therefore the lord will cut off from israel head and tail branch and rush in one day,bible-kjv
9 18 for wickedness burneth as the fire it shall devour the briers and thorns and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke,bible-kjv
10 3 and what will ye do in the day of visitation and in the desolation which shall come from far,bible-kjv
10 5 o assyrian the rod of mine anger and the staff in their hand is mine indignation,bible-kjv
is not hamath as arpad,bible-kjv
10 15 shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith,bible-kjv
10 19 and the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few that a child may write them,bible-kjv
10 24 therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts o my people that dwellest in zion be not afraid of the assyrian he shall smite thee with a rod and shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner of egypt,bible-kjv
10 30 lift up thy voice o daughter of gallim cause it to be heard unto laish o poor anathoth,bible-kjv
11 1 and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots 11 2 and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord 11 3 and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears 11 4 but with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked,bible-kjv
11 9 they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea,bible-kjv
11 14 but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the philistines toward the west they shall spoil them of the east together they shall lay their hand upon edom and moab and the children of ammon shall obey them,bible-kjv
12 3 therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation,bible-kjv
13 2 lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain exalt the voice unto them shake the hand that they may go into the gates of the nobles,bible-kjv
13 7 therefore shall all hands be faint and every man s heart shall melt 13 8 and they shall be afraid pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed one at another their faces shall be as flames,bible-kjv
13 13 therefore i will shake the heavens and the earth shall remove out of her place in the wrath of the lord of hosts and in the day of his fierce anger,bible-kjv
13 18 their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb their eyes shall not spare children,bible-kjv
14 1 for the lord will have mercy on jacob and will yet choose israel and set them in their own land and the strangers shall be joined with them and they shall cleave to the house of jacob,bible-kjv
14 6 he who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke he that ruled the nations in anger is persecuted and none hindereth,bible-kjv
art thou become like unto us,bible-kjv
14 15 yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit,bible-kjv
14 21 prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers that they do not rise nor possess the land nor fill the face of the world with cities,bible-kjv
14 27 for the lord of hosts hath purposed and who shall disannul it,bible-kjv
14 31 howl o gate cry o city thou whole palestina art dissolved for there shall come from the north a smoke and none shall be alone in his appointed times,bible-kjv
15 3 in their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth on the tops of their houses and in their streets every one shall howl weeping abundantly,bible-kjv
15 8 for the cry is gone round about the borders of moab the howling thereof unto eglaim and the howling thereof unto beerelim,bible-kjv
16 4 let mine outcasts dwell with thee moab be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler for the extortioner is at an end the spoiler ceaseth the oppressors are consumed out of the land,bible-kjv
16 9 therefore i will bewail with the weeping of jazer the vine of sibmah i will water thee with my tears o heshbon and elealeh for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen,bible-kjv
16 14 but now the lord hath spoken saying within three years as the years of an hireling and the glory of moab shall be contemned with all that great multitude and the remnant shall be very small and feeble,bible-kjv
17 4 and in that day it shall come to pass that the glory of jacob shall be made thin and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean,bible-kjv
17 9 in that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough and an uppermost branch which they left because of the children of israel and there shall be desolation,bible-kjv
this is the portion of them that spoil us and the lot of them that rob us,bible-kjv
18 6 they shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains and to the beasts of the earth and the fowls shall summer upon them and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them,bible-kjv
19 3 and the spirit of egypt shall fail in the midst thereof and i will destroy the counsel thereof and they shall seek to the idols and to the charmers and to them that have familiar spirits and to the wizards,bible-kjv
19 8 the fishers also shall mourn and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish,bible-kjv
where are thy wise men,bible-kjv
19 16 in that day shall egypt be like unto women and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the lord of hosts which he shaketh over it,bible-kjv
19 21 and the lord shall be known to egypt and the egyptians shall know the lord in that day and shall do sacrifice and oblation yea they shall vow a vow unto the lord and perform it,bible-kjv
and he did so walking naked and barefoot,bible-kjv
as whirlwinds in the south pass through so it cometh from the desert from a terrible land,bible-kjv
21 5 prepare the table watch in the watchtower eat drink arise ye princes and anoint the shield,bible-kjv
21 11 the burden of dumah,bible-kjv
in the forest in arabia shall ye lodge o ye travelling companies of dedanim,bible-kjv
what aileth thee now that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops,bible-kjv
22 6 and elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen and kir uncovered the shield,bible-kjv
22 11 ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago,bible-kjv
22 17 behold the lord will carry thee away with a mighty captivity and will surely cover thee,bible-kjv
22 23 and i will fasten him as a nail in a sure place and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father s house,bible-kjv
23 2 be still ye inhabitants of the isle thou whom the merchants of zidon that pass over the sea have replenished,bible-kjv
23 7 is this your joyous city whose antiquity is of ancient days,bible-kjv
23 11 he stretched out his hand over the sea he shook the kingdoms the lord hath given a commandment against the merchant city to destroy the strong holds thereof,bible-kjv
23 16 take an harp go about the city thou harlot that hast been forgotten make sweet melody sing many songs that thou mayest be remembered,bible-kjv
24 3 the land shall be utterly emptied and utterly spoiled for the lord hath spoken this word,bible-kjv
24 8 the mirth of tabrets ceaseth the noise of them that rejoice endeth the joy of the harp ceaseth,bible-kjv
24 13 when thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done,bible-kjv
the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously yea the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously,bible-kjv
24 21 and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high and the kings of the earth upon the earth,bible-kjv
25 3 therefore shall the strong people glorify thee the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee,bible-kjv
25 8 he will swallow up death in victory and the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth for the lord hath spoken it,bible-kjv
26 1 in that day shall this song be sung in the land of judah we have a strong city salvation will god appoint for walls and bulwarks,bible-kjv
26 7 the way of the just is uprightness thou most upright dost weigh the path of the just,bible-kjv
26 12 lord thou wilt ordain peace for us for thou also hast wrought all our works in us,bible-kjv
26 17 like as a woman with child that draweth near the time of her delivery is in pain and crieth out in her pangs so have we been in thy sight o lord,bible-kjv
26 21 for behold the lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity the earth also shall disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain,bible-kjv
i would go through them i would burn them together,bible-kjv
27 8 in measure when it shooteth forth thou wilt debate with it he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind,bible-kjv
27 13 and it shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet shall be blown and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of assyria and the outcasts in the land of egypt and shall worship the lord in the holy mount at jerusalem,bible-kjv
28 7 but they also have erred through wine and through strong drink are out of the way the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the way through strong drink they err in vision they stumble in judgment,bible-kjv
28 10 for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little 28 11 for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people,bible-kjv
28 17 judgment also will i lay to the line and righteousness to the plummet and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies and the waters shall overflow the hiding place,bible-kjv
28 22 now therefore be ye not mockers lest your bands be made strong for i have heard from the lord god of hosts a consumption even determined upon the whole earth,bible-kjv
28 26 for his god doth instruct him to discretion and doth teach him,bible-kjv
add ye year to year let them kill sacrifices,bible-kjv
29 6 thou shalt be visited of the lord of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise with storm and tempest and the flame of devouring fire,bible-kjv
29 11 and the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to one that is learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i cannot for it is sealed 29 12 and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i am not learned,bible-kjv
or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it he had no understanding,bible-kjv
29 22 therefore thus saith the lord who redeemed abraham concerning the house of jacob jacob shall not now be ashamed neither shall his face now wax pale,bible-kjv
30 4 for his princes were at zoan and his ambassadors came to hanes,bible-kjv
30 12 wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel because ye despise this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and stay thereon 30 13 therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall swelling out in a high wall whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant,bible-kjv
30 18 and therefore will the lord wait that he may be gracious unto you and therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you for the lord is a god of judgment blessed are all they that wait for him,bible-kjv
30 24 the oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan,bible-kjv
30 30 and the lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard and shall shew the lighting down of his arm with the indignation of his anger and with the flame of a devouring fire with scattering and tempest and hailstones,bible-kjv
31 2 yet he also is wise and will bring evil and will not call back his words but will arise against the house of the evildoers and against the help of them that work iniquity,bible-kjv
31 6 turn ye unto him from whom the children of israel have deeply revolted,bible-kjv
32 2 and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land,bible-kjv
32 7 the instruments also of the churl are evil he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words even when the needy speaketh right,bible-kjv
32 12 they shall lament for the teats for the pleasant fields for the fruitful vine,bible-kjv
32 20 blessed are ye that sow beside all waters that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass,bible-kjv
33 4 and your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them,bible-kjv
33 9 the earth mourneth and languisheth lebanon is ashamed and hewn down sharon is like a wilderness and bashan and carmel shake off their fruits,bible-kjv
33 14 the sinners in zion are afraid fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites,bible-kjv
33 18 thine heart shall meditate terror,bible-kjv
33 20 look upon zion the city of our solemnities thine eyes shall see jerusalem a quiet habitation a tabernacle that shall not be taken down not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken,bible-kjv
34 1 come near ye nations to hear and hearken ye people let the earth hear and all that is therein the world and all things that come forth of it,bible-kjv
34 6 the sword of the lord is filled with blood it is made fat with fatness and with the blood of lambs and goats with the fat of the kidneys of rams for the lord hath a sacrifice in bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of idumea,bible-kjv
34 11 but the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion and the stones of emptiness,bible-kjv
34 16 seek ye out of the book of the lord and read no one of these shall fail none shall want her mate for my mouth it hath commanded and his spirit it hath gathered them,bible-kjv
35 4 say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your god will come with vengeance even god with a recompence he will come and save you,bible-kjv
35 9 no lion shall be there nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon it shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk there 35 10 and the ransomed of the lord shall return and come to zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away,bible-kjv
36 4 and rabshakeh said unto them say ye now to hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trustest,bible-kjv
36 9 how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master s servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen,bible-kjv
hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you,bible-kjv
36 18 beware lest hezekiah persuade you saying the lord will deliver us,bible-kjv
36 20 who are they among all the gods of these lands that have delivered their land out of my hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of my hand,bible-kjv
37 3 and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth,bible-kjv
37 8 so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish,bible-kjv
37 13 where is the king of hamath and the king of arphad and the king of the city of sepharvaim hena and ivah,bible-kjv
37 20 now therefore o lord our god save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord even thou only,bible-kjv
37 24 by thy servants hast thou reproached the lord and hast said by the multitude of my chariots am i come up to the height of the mountains to the sides of lebanon and i will cut down the tall cedars thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enter into the height of his border and the forest of his carmel,bible-kjv
37 28 but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy rage against me,bible-kjv
37 34 by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saith the lord,bible-kjv
38 1 in those days was hezekiah sick unto death,bible-kjv
38 6 and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city,bible-kjv
38 12 mine age is departed and is removed from me as a shepherd s tent i have cut off like a weaver my life he will cut me off with pining sickness from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me,bible-kjv
38 16 o lord by these things men live and in all these things is the life of my spirit so wilt thou recover me and make me to live,bible-kjv
38 21 for isaiah had said let them take a lump of figs and lay it for a plaister upon the boil and he shall recover,bible-kjv
and from whence came they unto thee,bible-kjv
39 7 and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon,bible-kjv
40 3 the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god,bible-kjv
40 8 the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our god shall stand for ever,bible-kjv
40 13 who hath directed the spirit of the lord or being his counsellor hath taught him,bible-kjv
40 18 to whom then will ye liken god,bible-kjv
have ye not heard,bible-kjv
40 25 to whom then will ye liken me or shall i be equal,bible-kjv
hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary,bible-kjv
41 2 who raised up the righteous man from the east called him to his foot gave the nations before him and made him rule over kings,bible-kjv
41 5 the isles saw it and feared the ends of the earth were afraid drew near and came,bible-kjv
41 10 fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness,bible-kjv
41 15 behold i will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth thou shalt thresh the mountains and beat them small and shalt make the hills as chaff,bible-kjv
41 21 produce your cause saith the lord bring forth your strong reasons saith the king of jacob,bible-kjv
41 26 who hath declared from the beginning that we may know,bible-kjv
41 29 behold they are all vanity their works are nothing their molten images are wind and confusion,bible-kjv
42 5 thus saith god the lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein 42 6 i the lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles 42 7 to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house,bible-kjv
42 12 let them give glory unto the lord and declare his praise in the islands,bible-kjv
these things will i do unto them and not forsake them,bible-kjv
who is blind as he that is perfect and blind as the lord s servant,bible-kjv
who will hearken and hear for the time to come,bible-kjv
43 1 but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine,bible-kjv
43 8 bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the deaf that have ears,bible-kjv
43 12 i have declared and have saved and i have shewed when there was no strange god among you therefore ye are my witnesses saith the lord that i am god,bible-kjv
43 18 remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old,bible-kjv
43 22 but thou hast not called upon me o jacob but thou hast been weary of me o israel,bible-kjv
43 26 put me in remembrance let us plead together declare thou that thou mayest be justified,bible-kjv
44 5 one shall say i am the lord s and another shall call himself by the name of jacob and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the lord and surname himself by the name of israel,bible-kjv
ye are even my witnesses,bible-kjv
44 11 behold all his fellows shall be ashamed and the workmen they are of men let them all be gathered together let them stand up yet they shall fear and they shall be ashamed together,bible-kjv
44 16 he burneth part thereof in the fire with part thereof he eateth flesh he roasteth roast and is satisfied yea he warmeth himself and saith aha i am warm i have seen the fire 44 17 and the residue thereof he maketh a god even his graven image he falleth down unto it and worshippeth it and prayeth unto it and saith deliver me for thou art my god,bible-kjv
44 21 remember these o jacob and israel for thou art my servant i have formed thee thou art my servant o israel thou shalt not be forgotten of me,bible-kjv
45 4 for jacob my servant s sake and israel mine elect i have even called thee by thy name i have surnamed thee though thou hast not known me,bible-kjv
45 9 woe unto him that striveth with his maker,bible-kjv
or to the woman what hast thou brought forth,bible-kjv
45 15 verily thou art a god that hidest thyself o god of israel the saviour,bible-kjv
45 20 assemble yourselves and come draw near together ye that are escaped of the nations they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image and pray unto a god that cannot save,bible-kjv
45 22 look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none else,bible-kjv
46 2 they stoop they bow down together they could not deliver the burden but themselves are gone into captivity,bible-kjv
46 8 remember this and shew yourselves men bring it again to mind o ye transgressors,bible-kjv
47 3 thy nakedness shall be uncovered yea thy shame shall be seen i will take vengeance and i will not meet thee as a man,bible-kjv
47 8 therefore hear now this thou that art given to pleasures that dwellest carelessly that sayest in thine heart i am and none else beside me i shall not sit as a widow neither shall i know the loss of children 47 9 but these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day the loss of children and widowhood they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries and for the great abundance of thine enchantments,bible-kjv
47 13 thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels,bible-kjv
48 2 for they call themselves of the holy city and stay themselves upon the god of israel the lord of hosts is his name,bible-kjv
48 7 they are created now and not from the beginning even before the day when thou heardest them not lest thou shouldest say behold i knew them,bible-kjv
and i will not give my glory unto another,bible-kjv
48 15 i even i have spoken yea i have called him i have brought him and he shall make his way prosperous,bible-kjv
48 20 go ye forth of babylon flee ye from the chaldeans with a voice of singing declare ye tell this utter it even to the end of the earth say ye the lord hath redeemed his servant jacob,bible-kjv
49 4 then i said i have laboured in vain i have spent my strength for nought and in vain yet surely my judgment is with the lord and my work with my god,bible-kjv
they shall feed in the ways and their pastures shall be in all high places,bible-kjv
49 14 but zion said the lord hath forsaken me and my lord hath forgotten me,bible-kjv
49 18 lift up thine eyes round about and behold all these gather themselves together and come to thee,bible-kjv
and who hath brought up these,bible-kjv
49 25 but thus saith the lord even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered for i will contend with him that contendeth with thee and i will save thy children,bible-kjv
50 2 wherefore when i came was there no man,bible-kjv
50 3 i clothe the heavens with blackness and i make sackcloth their covering,bible-kjv
50 8 he is near that justifieth me who will contend with me,bible-kjv
50 10 who is among you that feareth the lord that obeyeth the voice of his servant that walketh in darkness and hath no light,bible-kjv
51 2 look unto abraham your father and unto sarah that bare you for i called him alone and blessed him and increased him,bible-kjv
51 7 hearken unto me ye that know righteousness the people in whose heart is my law fear ye not the reproach of men neither be ye afraid of their revilings,bible-kjv
51 11 therefore the redeemed of the lord shall return and come with singing unto zion and everlasting joy shall be upon their head they shall obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and mourning shall flee away,bible-kjv
51 16 and i have put my words in thy mouth and i have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand that i may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth and say unto zion thou art my people,bible-kjv
51 20 thy sons have fainted they lie at the head of all the streets as a wild bull in a net they are full of the fury of the lord the rebuke of thy god,bible-kjv
52 4 for thus saith the lord god my people went down aforetime into egypt to sojourn there and the assyrian oppressed them without cause,bible-kjv
52 8 thy watchmen shall lift up the voice with the voice together shall they sing for they shall see eye to eye when the lord shall bring again zion,bible-kjv
52 13 behold my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high,bible-kjv
53 3 he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not,bible-kjv
53 8 he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation,bible-kjv
53 12 therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors,bible-kjv
54 6 for the lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife of youth when thou wast refused saith thy god,bible-kjv
54 11 o thou afflicted tossed with tempest and not comforted behold i will lay thy stones with fair colours and lay thy foundations with sapphires,bible-kjv
54 16 behold i have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and i have created the waster to destroy,bible-kjv
and your labour for that which satisfieth not,bible-kjv
55 6 seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near 55 7 let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon,bible-kjv
55 13 instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree and it shall be to the lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off,bible-kjv
56 6 also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the lord to serve him and to love the name of the lord to be his servants every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold of my covenant 56 7 even them will i bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people,bible-kjv
56 12 come ye say they i will fetch wine and we will fill ourselves with strong drink and to morrow shall be as this day and much more abundant,bible-kjv
against whom make ye a wide mouth and draw out the tongue,bible-kjv
57 7 upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice,bible-kjv
have not i held my peace even of old and thou fearest me not,bible-kjv
57 17 for the iniquity of his covetousness was i wroth and smote him i hid me and was wroth and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart,bible-kjv
58 1 cry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and shew my people their transgression and the house of jacob their sins,bible-kjv
58 4 behold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice to be heard on high,bible-kjv
58 6 is not this the fast that i have chosen,bible-kjv
58 9 then shalt thou call and the lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say here i am,bible-kjv
59 3 for your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongue hath muttered perverseness,bible-kjv
59 8 the way of peace they know not and there is no judgment in their goings they have made them crooked paths whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace,bible-kjv
59 14 and judgment is turned away backward and justice standeth afar off for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter,bible-kjv
59 19 so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun,bible-kjv
60 2 for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee,bible-kjv
60 7 all the flocks of kedar shall be gathered together unto thee the rams of nebaioth shall minister unto thee they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar and i will glorify the house of my glory,bible-kjv
60 12 for the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish yea those nations shall be utterly wasted,bible-kjv
60 17 for brass i will bring gold and for iron i will bring silver and for wood brass and for stones iron i will also make thy officers peace and thine exactors righteousness,bible-kjv
60 22 a little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong nation i the lord will hasten it in his time,bible-kjv
61 7 for your shame ye shall have double and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion therefore in their land they shall possess the double everlasting joy shall be unto them,bible-kjv
62 1 for zion s sake will i not hold my peace and for jerusalem s sake i will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth,bible-kjv
62 6 i have set watchmen upon thy walls o jerusalem which shall never hold their peace day nor night ye that make mention of the lord keep not silence 62 7 and give him no rest till he establish and till he make jerusalem a praise in the earth,bible-kjv
63 1 who is this that cometh from edom with dyed garments from bozrah,bible-kjv
63 4 for the day of vengeance is in mine heart and the year of my redeemed is come,bible-kjv
63 9 in all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them in his love and in his pity he redeemed them and he bare them and carried them all the days of old,bible-kjv
63 13 that led them through the deep as an horse in the wilderness that they should not stumble,bible-kjv
63 17 o lord why hast thou made us to err from thy ways and hardened our heart from thy fear,bible-kjv
64 3 when thou didst terrible things which we looked not for thou camest down the mountains flowed down at thy presence,bible-kjv
64 8 but now o lord thou art our father we are the clay and thou our potter and we all are the work of thy hand,bible-kjv
wilt thou hold thy peace and afflict us very sore,bible-kjv
65 8 thus saith the lord as the new wine is found in the cluster and one saith destroy it not for a blessing is in it so will i do for my servants sakes that i may not destroy them all,bible-kjv
65 13 therefore thus saith the lord god behold my servants shall eat but ye shall be hungry behold my servants shall drink but ye shall be thirsty behold my servants shall rejoice but ye shall be ashamed 65 14 behold my servants shall sing for joy of heart but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart and shall howl for vexation of spirit,bible-kjv
65 20 there shall be no more thence an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die an hundred years old but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed,bible-kjv
65 25 the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock and dust shall be the serpent s meat,bible-kjv
66 3 he that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man he that sacrificeth a lamb as if he cut off a dog s neck he that offereth an oblation as if he offered swine s blood he that burneth incense as if he blessed an idol,bible-kjv
66 7 before she travailed she brought forth before her pain came she was delivered of a man child,bible-kjv
for as soon as zion travailed she brought forth her children,bible-kjv
66 12 for thus saith the lord behold i will extend peace to her like a river and the glory of the gentiles like a flowing stream then shall ye suck ye shall be borne upon her sides and be dandled upon her knees,bible-kjv
66 17 they that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst eating swine s flesh and the abomination and the mouse shall be consumed together saith the lord,bible-kjv
66 22 for as the new heavens and the new earth which i will make shall remain before me saith the lord so shall your seed and your name remain,bible-kjv
1 3 it came also in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah unto the end of the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiah king of judah unto the carrying away of jerusalem captive in the fifth month,bible-kjv
1 8 be not afraid of their faces for i am with thee to deliver thee saith the lord,bible-kjv
and i said i see a rod of an almond tree,bible-kjv
1 15 for lo i will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north saith the lord and they shall come and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of jerusalem and against all the walls thereof round about and against all the cities of judah,bible-kjv
2 1 moreover the word of the lord came to me saying 2 2 go and cry in the ears of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord i remember thee the kindness of thy youth the love of thine espousals when thou wentest after me in the wilderness in a land that was not sown,bible-kjv
2 8 the priests said not where is the lord,bible-kjv
but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit,bible-kjv
why is he spoiled,bible-kjv
or what hast thou to do in the way of assyria to drink the waters of the river,bible-kjv
2 23 how canst thou say i am not polluted i have not gone after baalim,bible-kjv
2 27 saying to a stock thou art my father and to a stone thou hast brought me forth for they have turned their back unto me and not their face but in the time of their trouble they will say arise and save us,bible-kjv
2 30 in vain have i smitten your children they received no correction your own sword hath devoured your prophets like a destroying lion,bible-kjv
2 32 can a maid forget her ornaments or a bride her attire,bible-kjv
2 35 yet thou sayest because i am innocent surely his anger shall turn from me,bible-kjv
3 1 they say if a man put away his wife and she go from him and become another man s shall he return unto her again,bible-kjv
3 3 therefore the showers have been withholden and there hath been no latter rain and thou hadst a whore s forehead thou refusedst to be ashamed,bible-kjv
3 6 the lord said also unto me in the days of josiah the king hast thou seen that which backsliding israel hath done,bible-kjv
3 8 and i saw when for all the causes whereby backsliding israel committed adultery i had put her away and given her a bill of divorce yet her treacherous sister judah feared not but went and played the harlot also,bible-kjv
3 13 only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou hast transgressed against the lord thy god and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree and ye have not obeyed my voice saith the lord,bible-kjv
3 19 but i said how shall i put thee among the children and give thee a pleasant land a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations,bible-kjv
behold we come unto thee for thou art the lord our god,bible-kjv
4 2 and thou shalt swear the lord liveth in truth in judgment and in righteousness and the nations shall bless themselves in him and in him shall they glory,bible-kjv
4 7 the lion is come up from his thicket and the destroyer of the gentiles is on his way he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate and thy cities shall be laid waste without an inhabitant,bible-kjv
4 11 at that time shall it be said to this people and to jerusalem a dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people not to fan nor to cleanse 4 12 even a full wind from those places shall come unto me now also will i give sentence against them,bible-kjv
how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee,bible-kjv
4 19 my bowels my bowels,bible-kjv
4 23 i beheld the earth and lo it was without form and void and the heavens and they had no light,bible-kjv
4 28 for this shall the earth mourn and the heavens above be black because i have spoken it i have purposed it and will not repent neither will i turn back from it,bible-kjv
for my soul is wearied because of murderers,bible-kjv
5 4 therefore i said surely these are poor they are foolish for they know not the way of the lord nor the judgment of their god,bible-kjv
5 8 they were as fed horses in the morning every one neighed after his neighbour s wife,bible-kjv
5 12 they have belied the lord and said it is not he neither shall evil come upon us neither shall we see sword nor famine 5 13 and the prophets shall become wind and the word is not in them thus shall it be done unto them,bible-kjv
5 18 nevertheless in those days saith the lord i will not make a full end with you,bible-kjv
5 23 but this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart they are revolted and gone,bible-kjv
5 28 they are waxen fat they shine yea they overpass the deeds of the wicked they judge not the cause the cause of the fatherless yet they prosper and the right of the needy do they not judge,bible-kjv
6 2 i have likened the daughter of zion to a comely and delicate woman,bible-kjv
6 5 arise and let us go by night and let us destroy her palaces,bible-kjv
6 10 to whom shall i speak and give warning that they may hear,bible-kjv
6 14 they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace,bible-kjv
6 17 also i set watchmen over you saying hearken to the sound of the trumpet,bible-kjv
your burnt offerings are not acceptable nor your sacrifices sweet unto me,bible-kjv
6 25 go not forth into the field nor walk by the way for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side,bible-kjv
6 30 reprobate silver shall men call them because the lord hath rejected them,bible-kjv
7 8 behold ye trust in lying words that cannot profit,bible-kjv
7 13 and now because ye have done all these works saith the lord and i spake unto you rising up early and speaking but ye heard not and i called you but ye answered not 7 14 therefore will i do unto this house which is called by my name wherein ye trust and unto the place which i gave to you and to your fathers as i have done to shiloh,bible-kjv
7 19 do they provoke me to anger,bible-kjv
7 24 but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart and went backward and not forward,bible-kjv
7 30 for the children of judah have done evil in my sight saith the lord they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to pollute it,bible-kjv
8 1 at that time saith the lord they shall bring out the bones of the kings of judah and the bones of his princes and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the inhabitants of jerusalem out of their graves 8 2 and they shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven whom they have loved and whom they have served and after whom they have walked and whom they have sought and whom they have worshipped they shall not be gathered nor be buried they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth,bible-kjv
they hold fast deceit they refuse to return,bible-kjv
lo certainly in vain made he it the pen of the scribes is in vain,bible-kjv
nay they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore shall they fall among them that fall in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down saith the lord,bible-kjv
8 16 the snorting of his horses was heard from dan the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones for they are come and have devoured the land and all that is in it the city and those that dwell therein,bible-kjv
why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images and with strange vanities,bible-kjv
9 1 oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears that i might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people,bible-kjv
9 5 and they will deceive every one his neighbour and will not speak the truth they have taught their tongue to speak lies and weary themselves to commit iniquity,bible-kjv
saith the lord shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this,bible-kjv
9 13 and the lord saith because they have forsaken my law which i set before them and have not obeyed my voice neither walked therein 9 14 but have walked after the imagination of their own heart and after baalim which their fathers taught them 9 15 therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will feed them even this people with wormwood and give them water of gall to drink,bible-kjv
9 20 yet hear the word of the lord o ye women and let your ear receive the word of his mouth and teach your daughters wailing and every one her neighbour lamentation,bible-kjv
10 1 hear ye the word which the lord speaketh unto you o house of israel 10 2 thus saith the lord learn not the way of the heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the heathen are dismayed at them,bible-kjv
10 6 forasmuch as there is none like unto thee o lord thou art great and thy name is great in might,bible-kjv
10 10 but the lord is the true god he is the living god and an everlasting king at his wrath the earth shall tremble and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation,bible-kjv
10 15 they are vanity and the work of errors in the time of their visitation they shall perish,bible-kjv
my wound is grievous but i said truly this is a grief and i must bear it,bible-kjv
10 24 o lord correct me but with judgment not in thine anger lest thou bring me to nothing,bible-kjv
11 7 for i earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that i brought them up out of the land of egypt even unto this day rising early and protesting saying obey my voice,bible-kjv
11 12 then shall the cities of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble,bible-kjv
11 16 the lord called thy name a green olive tree fair and of goodly fruit with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it and the branches of it are broken,bible-kjv
11 21 therefore thus saith the lord of the men of anathoth that seek thy life saying prophesy not in the name of the lord that thou die not by our hand 11 22 therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will punish them the young men shall die by the sword their sons and their daughters shall die by famine 11 23 and there shall be no remnant of them for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth even the year of their visitation,bible-kjv
12 4 how long shall the land mourn and the herbs of every field wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein,bible-kjv
12 7 i have forsaken mine house i have left mine heritage i have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies,bible-kjv
12 12 the spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness for the sword of the lord shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land no flesh shall have peace,bible-kjv
12 17 but if they will not obey i will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation saith the lord,bible-kjv
13 6 and it came to pass after many days that the lord said unto me arise go to euphrates and take the girdle from thence which i commanded thee to hide there,bible-kjv
13 12 therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word thus saith the lord god of israel every bottle shall be filled with wine and they shall say unto thee do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine,bible-kjv
13 17 but if ye will not hear it my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride and mine eye shall weep sore and run down with tears because the lord s flock is carried away captive,bible-kjv
for thou hast taught them to be captains and as chief over thee shall not sorrows take thee as a woman in travail,bible-kjv
13 24 therefore will i scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness,bible-kjv
wilt thou not be made clean,bible-kjv
14 4 because the ground is chapt for there was no rain in the earth the plowmen were ashamed they covered their heads,bible-kjv
14 9 why shouldest thou be as a man astonied as a mighty man that cannot save,bible-kjv
14 13 then said i ah lord god,bible-kjv
14 17 therefore thou shalt say this word unto them let mine eyes run down with tears night and day and let them not cease for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach with a very grievous blow,bible-kjv
hath thy soul lothed zion,bible-kjv
14 22 are there any among the vanities of the gentiles that can cause rain,bible-kjv
15 2 and it shall come to pass if they say unto thee whither shall we go forth,bible-kjv
or who shall bemoan thee,bible-kjv
15 9 she that hath borne seven languisheth she hath given up the ghost her sun is gone down while it was yet day she hath been ashamed and confounded and the residue of them will i deliver to the sword before their enemies saith the lord,bible-kjv
15 13 thy substance and thy treasures will i give to the spoil without price and that for all thy sins even in all thy borders,bible-kjv
15 18 why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable which refuseth to be healed,bible-kjv
16 1 the word of the lord came also unto me saying 16 2 thou shalt not take thee a wife neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place,bible-kjv
16 9 for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes and in your days the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride,bible-kjv
16 14 therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shall no more be said the lord liveth that brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt 16 15 but the lord liveth that brought up the children of israel from the land of the north and from all the lands whither he had driven them and i will bring them again into their land that i gave unto their fathers,bible-kjv
16 20 shall a man make gods unto himself and they are no gods,bible-kjv
17 5 thus saith the lord cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the lord,bible-kjv
17 10 i the lord search the heart i try the reins even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings,bible-kjv
17 15 behold they say unto me where is the word of the lord,bible-kjv
17 19 thus said the lord unto me go and stand in the gate of the children of the people whereby the kings of judah come in and by the which they go out and in all the gates of jerusalem 17 20 and say unto them hear ye the word of the lord ye kings of judah and all judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem that enter in by these gates 17 21 thus saith the lord take heed to yourselves and bear no burden on the sabbath day nor bring it in by the gates of jerusalem 17 22 neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day neither do ye any work but hallow ye the sabbath day as i commanded your fathers,bible-kjv
18 1 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying 18 2 arise and go down to the potter s house and there i will cause thee to hear my words,bible-kjv
behold as the clay is in the potter s hand so are ye in mine hand o house of israel,bible-kjv
18 13 therefore thus saith the lord ask ye now among the heathen who hath heard such things the virgin of israel hath done a very horrible thing,bible-kjv
18 18 then said they come and let us devise devices against jeremiah for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophet,bible-kjv
remember that i stood before thee to speak good for them and to turn away thy wrath from them,bible-kjv
19 4 because they have forsaken me and have estranged this place and have burned incense in it unto other gods whom neither they nor their fathers have known nor the kings of judah and have filled this place with the blood of innocents 19 5 they have built also the high places of baal to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto baal which i commanded not nor spake it neither came it into my mind 19 6 therefore behold the days come saith the lord that this place shall no more be called tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of slaughter,bible-kjv
19 12 thus will i do unto this place saith the lord and to the inhabitants thereof and even make this city as tophet 19 13 and the houses of jerusalem and the houses of the kings of judah shall be defiled as the place of tophet because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods,bible-kjv
then said jeremiah unto him the lord hath not called thy name pashur but magormissabib,bible-kjv
20 8 for since i spake i cried out i cried violence and spoil because the word of the lord was made a reproach unto me and a derision daily,bible-kjv
all my familiars watched for my halting saying peradventure he will be enticed and we shall prevail against him and we shall take our revenge on him,bible-kjv
20 15 cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father saying a man child is born unto thee making him very glad,bible-kjv
21 5 and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm even in anger and in fury and in great wrath,bible-kjv
21 10 for i have set my face against this city for evil and not for good saith the lord it shall be given into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire,bible-kjv
22 1 thus saith the lord go down to the house of the king of judah and speak there this word 22 2 and say hear the word of the lord o king of judah that sittest upon the throne of david thou and thy servants and thy people that enter in by these gates 22 3 thus saith the lord execute ye judgment and righteousness and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor and do no wrong do no violence to the stranger the fatherless nor the widow neither shed innocent blood in this place,bible-kjv
22 8 and many nations shall pass by this city and they shall say every man to his neighbour wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this great city,bible-kjv
22 15 shalt thou reign because thou closest thyself in cedar,bible-kjv
22 18 therefore thus saith the lord concerning jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah they shall not lament for him saying ah my brother,bible-kjv
22 20 go up to lebanon and cry and lift up thy voice in bashan and cry from the passages for all thy lovers are destroyed,bible-kjv
22 24 as i live saith the lord though coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand yet would i pluck thee thence 22 25 and i will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of the chaldeans,bible-kjv
wherefore are they cast out he and his seed and are cast into a land which they know not,bible-kjv
23 2 therefore thus saith the lord god of israel against the pastors that feed my people ye have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not visited them behold i will visit upon you the evil of your doings saith the lord,bible-kjv
23 7 therefore behold the days come saith the lord that they shall no more say the lord liveth which brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt 23 8 but the lord liveth which brought up and which led the seed of the house of israel out of the north country and from all countries whither i had driven them and they shall dwell in their own land,bible-kjv
23 13 and i have seen folly in the prophets of samaria they prophesied in baal and caused my people israel to err,bible-kjv
23 18 for who hath stood in the counsel of the lord and hath perceived and heard his word,bible-kjv
23 22 but if they had stood in my counsel and had caused my people to hear my words then they should have turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings,bible-kjv
saith the lord,bible-kjv
what is the chaff to the wheat,bible-kjv
23 31 behold i am against the prophets saith the lord that use their tongues and say he saith,bible-kjv
23 34 and as for the prophet and the priest and the people that shall say the burden of the lord i will even punish that man and his house,bible-kjv
and what hath the lord spoken,bible-kjv
and i said figs the good figs very good and the evil very evil that cannot be eaten they are so evil,bible-kjv
24 10 and i will send the sword the famine and the pestilence among them till they be consumed from off the land that i gave unto them and to their fathers,bible-kjv
25 8 therefore thus saith the lord of hosts because ye have not heard my words 25 9 behold i will send and take all the families of the north saith the lord and nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all these nations round about and will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and an hissing and perpetual desolations,bible-kjv
25 14 for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also and i will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands,bible-kjv
25 28 and it shall be if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink then shalt thou say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts ye shall certainly drink,bible-kjv
25 32 thus saith the lord of hosts behold evil shall go forth from nation to nation and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth,bible-kjv
25 37 and the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the lord,bible-kjv
26 8 now it came to pass when jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him saying thou shalt surely die,bible-kjv
26 12 then spake jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people saying the lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard,bible-kjv
26 17 then rose up certain of the elders of the land and spake to all the assembly of the people saying 26 18 micah the morasthite prophesied in the days of hezekiah king of judah and spake to all the people of judah saying thus saith the lord of hosts zion shall be plowed like a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest,bible-kjv
26 21 and when jehoiakim the king with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words the king sought to put him to death but when urijah heard it he was afraid and fled and went into egypt 26 22 and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt namely elnathan the son of achbor and certain men with him into egypt,bible-kjv
27 7 and all nations shall serve him and his son and his son s son until the very time of his land come and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him,bible-kjv
27 13 why will ye die thou and thy people by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence as the lord hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of babylon,bible-kjv
27 18 but if they be prophets and if the word of the lord be with them let them now make intercession to the lord of hosts that the vessels which are left in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and at jerusalem go not to babylon,bible-kjv
28 5 then the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the lord 28 6 even the prophet jeremiah said amen the lord do so the lord perform thy words which thou hast prophesied to bring again the vessels of the lord s house and all that is carried away captive from babylon into this place,bible-kjv
and the prophet jeremiah went his way,bible-kjv
28 17 so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month,bible-kjv
29 10 for thus saith the lord that after seventy years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place,bible-kjv
29 15 because ye have said the lord hath raised us up prophets in babylon 29 16 know that thus saith the lord of the king that sitteth upon the throne of david and of all the people that dwelleth in this city and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity 29 17 thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will send upon them the sword the famine and the pestilence and will make them like vile figs that cannot be eaten they are so evil,bible-kjv
29 28 for therefore he sent unto us in babylon saying this captivity is long build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them,bible-kjv
30 4 and these are the words that the lord spake concerning israel and concerning judah,bible-kjv
for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of jacob s trouble but he shall be saved out of it,bible-kjv
30 13 there is none to plead thy cause that thou mayest be bound up thou hast no healing medicines,bible-kjv
30 17 for i will restore health unto thee and i will heal thee of thy wounds saith the lord because they called thee an outcast saying this is zion whom no man seeketh after,bible-kjv
saith the lord,bible-kjv
31 2 thus saith the lord the people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness even israel when i went to cause him to rest,bible-kjv
31 7 for thus saith the lord sing with gladness for jacob and shout among the chief of the nations publish ye praise ye and say o lord save thy people the remnant of israel,bible-kjv
31 12 therefore they shall come and sing in the height of zion and shall flow together to the goodness of the lord for wheat and for wine and for oil and for the young of the flock and of the herd and their soul shall be as a watered garden and they shall not sorrow any more at all,bible-kjv
31 17 and there is hope in thine end saith the lord that thy children shall come again to their own border,bible-kjv
for since i spake against him i do earnestly remember him still therefore my bowels are troubled for him i will surely have mercy upon him saith the lord,bible-kjv
31 24 and there shall dwell in judah itself and in all the cities thereof together husbandmen and they that go forth with flocks,bible-kjv
31 29 in those days they shall say no more the fathers have eaten a sour grape and the children s teeth are set on edge,bible-kjv
31 37 thus saith the lord if heaven above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath i will also cast off all the seed of israel for all that they have done saith the lord,bible-kjv
32 2 for then the king of babylon s army besieged jerusalem and jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison which was in the king of judah s house,bible-kjv
32 9 and i bought the field of hanameel my uncle s son that was in anathoth and weighed him the money even seventeen shekels of silver,bible-kjv
32 16 now when i had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah i prayed unto the lord saying 32 17 ah lord god,bible-kjv
32 30 for the children of israel and the children of judah have only done evil before me from their youth for the children of israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands saith the lord,bible-kjv
32 36 and now therefore thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning this city whereof ye say it shall be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence 32 37 behold i will gather them out of all countries whither i have driven them in mine anger and in my fury and in great wrath and i will bring them again unto this place and i will cause them to dwell safely 32 38 and they shall be my people and i will be their god 32 39 and i will give them one heart and one way that they may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their children after them 32 40 and i will make an everlasting covenant with them that i will not turn away from them to do them good but i will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me,bible-kjv
33 1 moreover the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the second time while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison saying 33 2 thus saith the lord the maker thereof the lord that formed it to establish it the lord is his name 33 3 call unto me and i will answer thee and shew thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not,bible-kjv
33 9 and it shall be to me a name of joy a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth which shall hear all the good that i do unto them and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that i procure unto it,bible-kjv
33 14 behold the days come saith the lord that i will perform that good thing which i have promised unto the house of israel and to the house of judah,bible-kjv
33 22 as the host of heaven cannot be numbered neither the sand of the sea measured so will i multiply the seed of david my servant and the levites that minister unto me,bible-kjv
34 4 yet hear the word of the lord o zedekiah king of judah thus saith the lord of thee thou shalt not die by the sword 34 5 but thou shalt die in peace and with the burnings of thy fathers the former kings which were before thee so shall they burn odours for thee and they will lament thee saying ah lord,bible-kjv
34 11 but afterward they turned and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids,bible-kjv
34 21 and zedekiah king of judah and his princes will i give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and into the hand of the king of babylon s army which are gone up from you,bible-kjv
35 8 thus have we obeyed the voice of jonadab the son of rechab our father in all that he hath charged us to drink no wine all our days we our wives our sons nor our daughters 35 9 nor to build houses for us to dwell in neither have we vineyard nor field nor seed 35 10 but we have dwelt in tents and have obeyed and done according to all that jonadab our father commanded us,bible-kjv
35 15 i have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them saying return ye now every man from his evil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to serve them and ye shall dwell in the land which i have given to you and to your fathers but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto me,bible-kjv
36 4 then jeremiah called baruch the son of neriah and baruch wrote from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the lord which he had spoken unto him upon a roll of a book,bible-kjv
36 10 then read baruch in the book the words of jeremiah in the house of the lord in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe in the higher court at the entry of the new gate of the lord s house in the ears of all the people,bible-kjv
36 15 and they said unto him sit down now and read it in our ears,bible-kjv
36 19 then said the princes unto baruch go hide thee thou and jeremiah and let no man know where ye be,bible-kjv
36 23 and it came to pass that when jehudi had read three or four leaves he cut it with the penknife and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth,bible-kjv
36 29 and thou shalt say to jehoiakim king of judah thus saith the lord thou hast burned this roll saying why hast thou written therein saying the king of babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast,bible-kjv
37 2 but neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land did hearken unto the words of the lord which he spake by the prophet jeremiah,bible-kjv
37 8 and the chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city and take it and burn it with fire,bible-kjv
37 14 then said jeremiah it is false i fall not away to the chaldeans,bible-kjv
37 18 moreover jeremiah said unto king zedekiah what have i offended against thee or against thy servants or against this people that ye have put me in prison,bible-kjv
38 1 then shephatiah the son of mattan and gedaliah the son of pashur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashur the son of malchiah heard the words that jeremiah had spoken unto all the people saying 38 2 thus saith the lord he that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth forth to the chaldeans shall live for he shall have his life for a prey and shall live,bible-kjv
and in the dungeon there was no water but mire so jeremiah sunk in the mire,bible-kjv
and jeremiah did so,bible-kjv
38 16 so zedekiah the king sware secretly unto jeremiah saying as the lord liveth that made us this soul i will not put thee to death neither will i give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life,bible-kjv
38 21 but if thou refuse to go forth this is the word that the lord hath shewed me 38 22 and behold all the women that are left in the king of judah s house shall be brought forth to the king of babylon s princes and those women shall say thy friends have set thee on and have prevailed against thee thy feet are sunk in the mire and they are turned away back,bible-kjv
so they left off speaking with him for the matter was not perceived,bible-kjv
39 4 and it came to pass that when zedekiah the king of judah saw them and all the men of war then they fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the king s garden by the gate betwixt the two walls and he went out the way of the plain,bible-kjv
39 9 then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city and those that fell away that fell to him with the rest of the people that remained,bible-kjv
39 17 but i will deliver thee in that day saith the lord and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid,bible-kjv
40 4 and now behold i loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand,bible-kjv
40 7 now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields even they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land and had committed unto him men and women and children and of the poor of the land of them that were not carried away captive to babylon 40 8 then they came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan and jonathan the sons of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth and the sons of ephai the netophathite and jezaniah the son of a maachathite they and their men,bible-kjv
but gedaliah the son of ahikam believed them not,bible-kjv
41 3 ishmael also slew all the jews that were with him even with gedaliah at mizpah and the chaldeans that were found there and the men of war,bible-kjv
so he forbare and slew them not among their brethren,bible-kjv
41 14 so all the people that ishmael had carried away captive from mizpah cast about and returned and went unto johanan the son of kareah,bible-kjv
42 5 then they said to jeremiah the lord be a true and faithful witness between us if we do not even according to all things for the which the lord thy god shall send thee to us,bible-kjv
42 12 and i will shew mercies unto you that he may have mercy upon you and cause you to return to your own land,bible-kjv
42 20 for ye dissembled in your hearts when ye sent me unto the lord your god saying pray for us unto the lord our god and according unto all that the lord our god shall say so declare unto us and we will do it,bible-kjv
43 5 but johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of judah that were returned from all nations whither they had been driven to dwell in the land of judah 43 6 even men and women and children and the king s daughters and every person that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan and jeremiah the prophet and baruch the son of neriah,bible-kjv
43 13 he shall break also the images of bethshemesh that is in the land of egypt and the houses of the gods of the egyptians shall he burn with fire,bible-kjv
44 7 therefore now thus saith the lord the god of hosts the god of israel wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls to cut off from you man and woman child and suckling out of judah to leave you none to remain 44 8 in that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands burning incense unto other gods in the land of egypt whither ye be gone to dwell that ye might cut yourselves off and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth,bible-kjv
44 13 for i will punish them that dwell in the land of egypt as i have punished jerusalem by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence 44 14 so that none of the remnant of judah which are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall escape or remain that they should return into the land of judah to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there for none shall return but such as shall escape,bible-kjv
44 20 then jeremiah said unto all the people to the men and to the women and to all the people which had given him that answer saying 44 21 the incense that ye burned in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem ye and your fathers your kings and your princes and the people of the land did not the lord remember them and came it not into his mind,bible-kjv
44 27 behold i will watch over them for evil and not for good and all the men of judah that are in the land of egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine until there be an end of them,bible-kjv
45 4 thus shalt thou say unto him the lord saith thus behold that which i have built will i break down and that which i have planted i will pluck up even this whole land,bible-kjv
46 4 harness the horses and get up ye horsemen and stand forth with your helmets furbish the spears and put on the brigandines,bible-kjv
46 8 egypt riseth up like a flood and his waters are moved like the rivers and he saith i will go up and will cover the earth i will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof,bible-kjv
46 13 the word that the lord spake to jeremiah the prophet how nebuchadrezzar king of babylon should come and smite the land of egypt,bible-kjv
46 17 they did cry there pharaoh king of egypt is but a noise he hath passed the time appointed,bible-kjv
46 22 the voice thereof shall go like a serpent for they shall march with an army and come against her with axes as hewers of wood,bible-kjv
46 28 fear thou not o jacob my servant saith the lord for i am with thee for i will make a full end of all the nations whither i have driven thee but i will not make a full end of thee but correct thee in measure yet will i not leave thee wholly unpunished,bible-kjv
47 6 o thou sword of the lord how long will it be ere thou be quiet,bible-kjv
for it is spoiled kiriathaim is confounded and taken misgab is confounded and dismayed,bible-kjv
48 5 for in the going up of luhith continual weeping shall go up for in the going down of horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction,bible-kjv
48 10 cursed be he that doeth the work of the lord deceitfully and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood,bible-kjv
48 15 moab is spoiled and gone up out of her cities and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter saith the king whose name is the lord of hosts,bible-kjv
48 20 moab is confounded for it is broken down howl and cry tell ye it in arnon that moab is spoiled 48 21 and judgment is come upon the plain country upon holon and upon jahazah and upon mephaath 48 22 and upon dibon and upon nebo and upon bethdiblathaim 48 23 and upon kiriathaim and upon bethgamul and upon bethmeon 48 24 and upon kerioth and upon bozrah and upon all the cities of the land of moab far or near,bible-kjv
for since thou spakest of him thou skippedst for joy,bible-kjv
48 32 o vine of sibmah i will weep for thee with the weeping of jazer thy plants are gone over the sea they reach even to the sea of jazer the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage,bible-kjv
48 37 for every head shall be bald and every beard clipped upon all the hands shall be cuttings and upon the loins sackcloth,bible-kjv
48 40 for thus saith the lord behold he shall fly as an eagle and shall spread his wings over moab,bible-kjv
48 45 they that fled stood under the shadow of heshbon because of the force but a fire shall come forth out of heshbon and a flame from the midst of sihon and shall devour the corner of moab and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones,bible-kjv
49 1 concerning the ammonites thus saith the lord hath israel no sons,bible-kjv
49 4 wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys thy flowing valley o backsliding daughter,bible-kjv
is counsel perished from the prudent,bible-kjv
49 10 but i have made esau bare i have uncovered his secret places and he shall not be able to hide himself his seed is spoiled and his brethren and his neighbours and he is not,bible-kjv
49 14 i have heard a rumour from the lord and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen saying gather ye together and come against her and rise up to the battle,bible-kjv
49 19 behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of jordan against the habitation of the strong but i will suddenly make him run away from her and who is a chosen man that i may appoint over her,bible-kjv
49 21 the earth is moved at the noise of their fall at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the red sea,bible-kjv
49 25 how is the city of praise not left the city of my joy,bible-kjv
49 30 flee get you far off dwell deep o ye inhabitants of hazor saith the lord for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath taken counsel against you and hath conceived a purpose against you,bible-kjv
49 36 and upon elam will i bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven and will scatter them toward all those winds and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of elam shall not come,bible-kjv
50 3 for out of the north there cometh up a nation against her which shall make her land desolate and none shall dwell therein they shall remove they shall depart both man and beast,bible-kjv
50 8 remove out of the midst of babylon and go forth out of the land of the chaldeans and be as the he goats before the flocks,bible-kjv
50 14 put yourselves in array against babylon round about all ye that bend the bow shoot at her spare no arrows for she hath sinned against the lord,bible-kjv
50 19 and i will bring israel again to his habitation and he shall feed on carmel and bashan and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount ephraim and gilead,bible-kjv
how is babylon become a desolation among the nations,bible-kjv
for their day is come the time of their visitation,bible-kjv
50 32 and the most proud shall stumble and fall and none shall raise him up and i will kindle a fire in his cities and it shall devour all round about him,bible-kjv
50 37 a sword is upon their horses and upon their chariots and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her and they shall become as women a sword is upon her treasures and they shall be robbed,bible-kjv
50 42 they shall hold the bow and the lance they are cruel and will not shew mercy their voice shall roar like the sea and they shall ride upon horses every one put in array like a man to the battle against thee o daughter of babylon,bible-kjv
and who is that shepherd that will stand before me,bible-kjv
51 4 thus the slain shall fall in the land of the chaldeans and they that are thrust through in her streets,bible-kjv
51 9 we would have healed babylon but she is not healed forsake her and let us go every one into his own country for her judgment reacheth unto heaven and is lifted up even to the skies,bible-kjv
51 14 the lord of hosts hath sworn by himself saying surely i will fill thee with men as with caterpillers and they shall lift up a shout against thee,bible-kjv
51 19 the portion of jacob is not like them for he is the former of all things and israel is the rod of his inheritance the lord of hosts is his name,bible-kjv
51 27 set ye up a standard in the land blow the trumpet among the nations prepare the nations against her call together against her the kingdoms of ararat minni and ashchenaz appoint a captain against her cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers,bible-kjv
51 33 for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel the daughter of babylon is like a threshingfloor it is time to thresh her yet a little while and the time of her harvest shall come,bible-kjv
51 38 they shall roar together like lions they shall yell as lions whelps,bible-kjv
how is babylon become an astonishment among the nations,bible-kjv
51 46 and lest your heart faint and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land a rumour shall both come one year and after that in another year shall come a rumour and violence in the land ruler against ruler,bible-kjv
51 51 we are confounded because we have heard reproach shame hath covered our faces for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the lord s house,bible-kjv
51 58 thus saith the lord of hosts the broad walls of babylon shall be utterly broken and her high gates shall be burned with fire and the people shall labour in vain and the folk in the fire and they shall be weary,bible-kjv
51 63 and it shall be when thou hast made an end of reading this book that thou shalt bind a stone to it and cast it into the midst of euphrates 51 64 and thou shalt say thus shall babylon sink and shall not rise from the evil that i will bring upon her and they shall be weary,bible-kjv
52 3 for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem and judah till he had cast them out from his presence that zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon,bible-kjv
52 8 but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho and all his army was scattered from him,bible-kjv
52 15 then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people and the residue of the people that remained in the city and those that fell away that fell to the king of babylon and the rest of the multitude,bible-kjv
52 20 the two pillars one sea and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases which king solomon had made in the house of the lord the brass of all these vessels was without weight,bible-kjv
52 24 and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest and zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door 52 25 he took also out of the city an eunuch which had the charge of the men of war and seven men of them that were near the king s person which were found in the city and the principal scribe of the host who mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the midst of the city,bible-kjv
52 31 and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of jehoiachin king of judah in the twelfth month in the five and twentieth day of the month that evilmerodach king of babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of jehoiachin king of judah and brought him forth out of prison,bible-kjv
how is she become as a widow,bible-kjv
1 5 her adversaries are the chief her enemies prosper for the lord hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions her children are gone into captivity before the enemy,bible-kjv
o lord behold my affliction for the enemy hath magnified himself,bible-kjv
1 13 from above hath he sent fire into my bones and it prevaileth against them he hath spread a net for my feet he hath turned me back he hath made me desolate and faint all the day,bible-kjv
1 18 the lord is righteous for i have rebelled against his commandment hear i pray you all people and behold my sorrow my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity,bible-kjv
2 1 how hath the lord covered the daughter of zion with a cloud in his anger and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of israel and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger,bible-kjv
2 6 and he hath violently taken away his tabernacle as if it were of a garden he hath destroyed his places of the assembly the lord hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in zion and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest,bible-kjv
2 11 mine eyes do fail with tears my bowels are troubled my liver is poured upon the earth for the destruction of the daughter of my people because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city,bible-kjv
what shall i equal to thee that i may comfort thee o virgin daughter of zion,bible-kjv
2 17 the lord hath done that which he had devised he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old he hath thrown down and hath not pitied and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries,bible-kjv
shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the lord,bible-kjv
3 3 surely against me is he turned he turneth his hand against me all the day,bible-kjv
3 8 also when i cry and shout he shutteth out my prayer,bible-kjv
3 13 he hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins,bible-kjv
3 18 and i said my strength and my hope is perished from the lord 3 19 remembering mine affliction and my misery the wormwood and the gall,bible-kjv
3 24 the lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will i hope in him,bible-kjv
3 29 he putteth his mouth in the dust if so be there may be hope,bible-kjv
3 35 to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most high 3 36 to subvert a man in his cause the lord approveth not,bible-kjv
3 41 let us lift up our heart with our hands unto god in the heavens,bible-kjv
3 46 all our enemies have opened their mouths against us,bible-kjv
3 51 mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city,bible-kjv
3 56 thou hast heard my voice hide not thine ear at my breathing at my cry,bible-kjv
3 61 thou hast heard their reproach o lord and all their imaginations against me 3 62 the lips of those that rose up against me and their device against me all the day,bible-kjv
4 1 how is the gold become dim,bible-kjv
4 4 the tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst the young children ask bread and no man breaketh it unto them,bible-kjv
4 10 the hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people,bible-kjv
4 16 the anger of the lord hath divided them he will no more regard them they respected not the persons of the priests they favoured not the elders,bible-kjv
4 21 rejoice and be glad o daughter of edom that dwellest in the land of uz the cup also shall pass through unto thee thou shalt be drunken and shalt make thyself naked,bible-kjv
5 4 we have drunken our water for money our wood is sold unto us,bible-kjv
5 9 we gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness,bible-kjv
5 14 the elders have ceased from the gate the young men from their musick,bible-kjv
5 19 thou o lord remainest for ever thy throne from generation to generation,bible-kjv
1 1 now it came to pass in the thirtieth year in the fourth month in the fifth day of the month as i was among the captives by the river of chebar that the heavens were opened and i saw visions of god,bible-kjv
1 6 and every one had four faces and every one had four wings,bible-kjv
1 11 thus were their faces and their wings were stretched upward two wings of every one were joined one to another and two covered their bodies,bible-kjv
1 16 the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel,bible-kjv
1 21 when those went these went and when those stood these stood and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels,bible-kjv
1 26 and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it,bible-kjv
2 1 and he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and i will speak unto thee,bible-kjv
2 5 and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are a rebellious house yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them,bible-kjv
3 1 moreover he said unto me son of man eat that thou findest eat this roll and go speak unto the house of israel,bible-kjv
3 5 for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language but to the house of israel 3 6 not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language whose words thou canst not understand,bible-kjv
3 10 moreover he said unto me son of man all my words that i shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart and hear with thine ears,bible-kjv
3 15 then i came to them of the captivity at telabib that dwelt by the river of chebar and i sat where they sat and remained there astonished among them seven days,bible-kjv
3 21 nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous sin not and he doth not sin he shall surely live because he is warned also thou hast delivered thy soul,bible-kjv
3 27 but when i speak with thee i will open thy mouth and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god he that heareth let him hear and he that forbeareth let him forbear for they are a rebellious house,bible-kjv
4 5 for i have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity according to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of israel,bible-kjv
4 10 and thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight twenty shekels a day from time to time shalt thou eat it,bible-kjv
behold my soul hath not been polluted for from my youth up even till now have i not eaten of that which dieth of itself or is torn in pieces neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth,bible-kjv
5 3 thou shalt also take thereof a few in number and bind them in thy skirts,bible-kjv
5 9 and i will do in thee that which i have not done and whereunto i will not do any more the like because of all thine abominations,bible-kjv
5 14 moreover i will make thee waste and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee in the sight of all that pass by,bible-kjv
6 1 and the word of the lord came unto me saying 6 2 son of man set thy face toward the mountains of israel and prophesy against them 6 3 and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys behold i even i will bring a sword upon you and i will destroy your high places,bible-kjv
6 8 yet will i leave a remnant that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations when ye shall be scattered through the countries,bible-kjv
6 12 he that is far off shall die of the pestilence and he that is near shall fall by the sword and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine thus will i accomplish my fury upon them,bible-kjv
7 4 and mine eye shall not spare thee neither will i have pity but i will recompense thy ways upon thee and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee and ye shall know that i am the lord,bible-kjv
7 9 and mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity i will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee and ye shall know that i am the lord that smiteth,bible-kjv
7 14 they have blown the trumpet even to make all ready but none goeth to the battle for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof,bible-kjv
7 19 they shall cast their silver in the streets and their gold shall be removed their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the lord they shall not satisfy their souls neither fill their bowels because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity,bible-kjv
7 24 wherefore i will bring the worst of the heathen and they shall possess their houses i will also make the pomp of the strong to cease and their holy places shall be defiled,bible-kjv
8 2 then i beheld and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire from the appearance of his loins even downward fire and from his loins even upward as the appearance of brightness as the colour of amber,bible-kjv
8 6 he said furthermore unto me son of man seest thou what they do,bible-kjv
8 9 and he said unto me go in and behold the wicked abominations that they do here,bible-kjv
8 13 he said also unto me turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do,bible-kjv
8 17 then he said unto me hast thou seen this o son of man,bible-kjv
9 2 and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lieth toward the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writer s inkhorn by his side and they went in and stood beside the brasen altar,bible-kjv
9 7 and he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts with the slain go ye forth,bible-kjv
9 10 and as for me also mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity but i will recompense their way upon their head,bible-kjv
10 3 now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house when the man went in and the cloud filled the inner court,bible-kjv
10 8 and there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man s hand under their wings,bible-kjv
10 13 as for the wheels it was cried unto them in my hearing o wheel,bible-kjv
10 17 when they stood these stood and when they were lifted up these lifted up themselves also for the spirit of the living creature was in them,bible-kjv
10 22 and the likeness of their faces was the same faces which i saw by the river of chebar their appearances and themselves they went every one straight forward,bible-kjv
11 6 ye have multiplied your slain in this city and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain,bible-kjv
11 11 this city shall not be your caldron neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof but i will judge you in the border of israel 11 12 and ye shall know that i am the lord for ye have not walked in my statutes neither executed my judgments but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you,bible-kjv
11 16 therefore say thus saith the lord god although i have cast them far off among the heathen and although i have scattered them among the countries yet will i be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come,bible-kjv
11 22 then did the cherubims lift up their wings and the wheels beside them and the glory of the god of israel was over them above,bible-kjv
12 1 the word of the lord also came unto me saying 12 2 son of man thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house which have eyes to see and see not they have ears to hear and hear not for they are a rebellious house,bible-kjv
12 7 and i did so as i was commanded i brought forth my stuff by day as stuff for captivity and in the even i digged through the wall with mine hand i brought it forth in the twilight and i bare it upon my shoulder in their sight,bible-kjv
12 13 my net also will i spread upon him and he shall be taken in my snare and i will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldeans yet shall he not see it though he shall die there,bible-kjv
12 20 and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste and the land shall be desolate and ye shall know that i am the lord,bible-kjv
12 26 again the word of the lord came to me saying,bible-kjv
13 5 ye have not gone up into the gaps neither made up the hedge for the house of israel to stand in the battle in the day of the lord,bible-kjv
13 10 because even because they have seduced my people saying peace and there was no peace and one built up a wall and lo others daubed it with untempered morter 13 11 say unto them which daub it with untempered morter that it shall fall there shall be an overflowing shower and ye o great hailstones shall fall and a stormy wind shall rend it,bible-kjv
13 17 likewise thou son of man set thy face against the daughters of thy people which prophesy out of their own heart and prophesy thou against them 13 18 and say thus saith the lord god woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls,bible-kjv
13 22 because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad whom i have not made sad and strengthened the hands of the wicked that he should not return from his wicked way by promising him life 13 23 therefore ye shall see no more vanity nor divine divinations for i will deliver my people out of your hand and ye shall know that i am the lord,bible-kjv
14 7 for every one of the house of israel or of the stranger that sojourneth in israel which separateth himself from me and setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me i the lord will answer him by myself 14 8 and i will set my face against that man and will make him a sign and a proverb and i will cut him off from the midst of my people and ye shall know that i am the lord,bible-kjv
14 17 or if i bring a sword upon that land and say sword go through the land so that i cut off man and beast from it 14 18 though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters but they only shall be delivered themselves,bible-kjv
15 1 and the word of the lord came unto me saying 15 2 son of man what is the vine tree more than any tree or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest,bible-kjv
15 5 behold when it was whole it was meet for no work how much less shall it be meet yet for any work when the fire hath devoured it and it is burned,bible-kjv
16 4 and as for thy nativity in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee thou wast not salted at all nor swaddled at all,bible-kjv
16 9 then washed i thee with water yea i throughly washed away thy blood from thee and i anointed thee with oil,bible-kjv
16 14 and thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty for it was perfect through my comeliness which i had put upon thee saith the lord god,bible-kjv
16 20 moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thou hast borne unto me and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured,bible-kjv
16 25 thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by and multiplied thy whoredoms,bible-kjv
16 30 how weak is thine heart saith the lord god seeing thou doest all these things the work of an imperious whorish woman 16 31 in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way and makest thine high place in every street and hast not been as an harlot in that thou scornest hire 16 32 but as a wife that committeth adultery which taketh strangers instead of her husband,bible-kjv
16 39 and i will also give thee into their hand and they shall throw down thine eminent place and shall break down thy high places they shall strip thee also of thy clothes and shall take thy fair jewels and leave thee naked and bare,bible-kjv
16 44 behold every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee saying as is the mother so is her daughter,bible-kjv
16 49 behold this was the iniquity of thy sister sodom pride fulness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy,bible-kjv
16 55 when thy sisters sodom and her daughters shall return to their former estate and samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate,bible-kjv
16 61 then thou shalt remember thy ways and be ashamed when thou shalt receive thy sisters thine elder and thy younger and i will give them unto thee for daughters but not by thy covenant,bible-kjv
17 7 there was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers and behold this vine did bend her roots toward him and shot forth her branches toward him that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation,bible-kjv
17 10 yea behold being planted shall it prosper,bible-kjv
17 15 but he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into egypt that they might give him horses and much people,bible-kjv
17 17 neither shall pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war by casting up mounts and building forts to cut off many persons 17 18 seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant when lo he had given his hand and hath done all these things he shall not escape,bible-kjv
17 24 and all the trees of the field shall know that i the lord have brought down the high tree have exalted the low tree have dried up the green tree and have made the dry tree to flourish i the lord have spoken and have done it,bible-kjv
18 10 if he beget a son that is a robber a shedder of blood and that doeth the like to any one of these things 18 11 and that doeth not any of those duties but even hath eaten upon the mountains and defiled his neighbour s wife 18 12 hath oppressed the poor and needy hath spoiled by violence hath not restored the pledge and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols hath committed abomination 18 13 hath given forth upon usury and hath taken increase shall he then live,bible-kjv
doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father,bible-kjv
18 22 all his transgressions that he hath committed they shall not be mentioned unto him in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live,bible-kjv
18 25 yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal,bible-kjv
18 28 because he considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed he shall surely live he shall not die,bible-kjv
repent and turn yourselves from all your transgressions so iniquity shall not be your ruin,bible-kjv
19 3 and she brought up one of her whelps it became a young lion and it learned to catch the prey it devoured men,bible-kjv
19 8 then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces and spread their net over him he was taken in their pit,bible-kjv
19 13 and now she is planted in the wilderness in a dry and thirsty ground,bible-kjv
as i live saith the lord god i will not be enquired of by you,bible-kjv
20 10 wherefore i caused them to go forth out of the land of egypt and brought them into the wilderness,bible-kjv
20 15 yet also i lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness that i would not bring them into the land which i had given them flowing with milk and honey which is the glory of all lands 20 16 because they despised my judgments and walked not in my statutes but polluted my sabbaths for their heart went after their idols,bible-kjv
20 23 i lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness that i would scatter them among the heathen and disperse them through the countries 20 24 because they had not executed my judgments but had despised my statutes and had polluted my sabbaths and their eyes were after their fathers idols,bible-kjv
and the name whereof is called bamah unto this day,bible-kjv
20 32 and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all that ye say we will be as the heathen as the families of the countries to serve wood and stone,bible-kjv
20 39 as for you o house of israel thus saith the lord god go ye serve ye every one his idols and hereafter also if ye will not hearken unto me but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts and with your idols,bible-kjv
20 44 and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have wrought with you for my name s sake not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings o ye house of israel saith the lord god,bible-kjv
21 1 and the word of the lord came unto me saying 21 2 son of man set thy face toward jerusalem and drop thy word toward the holy places and prophesy against the land of israel 21 3 and say to the land of israel thus saith the lord behold i am against thee and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked,bible-kjv
21 8 again the word of the lord came unto me saying 21 9 son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord say a sword a sword is sharpened and also furbished 21 10 it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter it is furbished that it may glitter should we then make mirth,bible-kjv
it shall be no more saith the lord god,bible-kjv
21 16 go thee one way or other either on the right hand or on the left whithersoever thy face is set,bible-kjv
21 22 at his right hand was the divination for jerusalem to appoint captains to open the mouth in the slaughter to lift up the voice with shouting to appoint battering rams against the gates to cast a mount and to build a fort,bible-kjv
21 28 and thou son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord god concerning the ammonites and concerning their reproach even say thou the sword the sword is drawn for the slaughter it is furbished to consume because of the glittering 21 29 whiles they see vanity unto thee whiles they divine a lie unto thee to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain of the wicked whose day is come when their iniquity shall have an end,bible-kjv
22 1 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying 22 2 now thou son of man wilt thou judge wilt thou judge the bloody city,bible-kjv
22 6 behold the princes of israel every one were in thee to their power to shed blood,bible-kjv
22 11 and one hath committed abomination with his neighbour s wife and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law and another in thee hath humbled his sister his father s daughter,bible-kjv
22 15 and i will scatter thee among the heathen and disperse thee in the countries and will consume thy filthiness out of thee,bible-kjv
22 21 yea i will gather you and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath and ye shall be melted in the midst therof,bible-kjv
22 27 her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood and to destroy souls to get dishonest gain,bible-kjv
23 1 the word of the lord came again unto me saying 23 2 son of man there were two women the daughters of one mother 23 3 and they committed whoredoms in egypt they committed whoredoms in their youth there were their breasts pressed and there they bruised the teats of their virginity,bible-kjv
23 8 neither left she her whoredoms brought from egypt for in her youth they lay with her and they bruised the breasts of her virginity and poured their whoredom upon her,bible-kjv
23 13 then i saw that she was defiled that they took both one way 23 14 and that she increased her whoredoms for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall the images of the chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion 23 15 girded with girdles upon their loins exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads all of them princes to look to after the manner of the babylonians of chaldea the land of their nativity 23 16 and as soon as she saw them with her eyes she doted upon them and sent messengers unto them into chaldea,bible-kjv
23 21 thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth in bruising thy teats by the egyptians for the paps of thy youth,bible-kjv
23 27 thus will i make thy lewdness to cease from thee and thy whoredom brought from the land of egypt so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them nor remember egypt any more,bible-kjv
23 33 thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow with the cup of astonishment and desolation with the cup of thy sister samaria,bible-kjv
23 38 moreover this they have done unto me they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day and have profaned my sabbaths,bible-kjv
23 44 yet they went in unto her as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot so went they in unto aholah and unto aholibah the lewd women,bible-kjv
23 49 and they shall recompense your lewdness upon you and ye shall bear the sins of your idols and ye shall know that i am the lord god,bible-kjv
bring it out piece by piece let no lot fall upon it,bible-kjv
24 11 then set it empty upon the coals thereof that the brass of it may be hot and may burn and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it that the scum of it may be consumed,bible-kjv
24 17 forbear to cry make no mourning for the dead bind the tire of thine head upon thee and put on thy shoes upon thy feet and cover not thy lips and eat not the bread of men,bible-kjv
24 23 and your tires shall be upon your heads and your shoes upon your feet ye shall not mourn nor weep but ye shall pine away for your iniquities and mourn one toward another,bible-kjv
25 5 and i will make rabbah a stable for camels and the ammonites a couching place for flocks and ye shall know that i am the lord,bible-kjv
25 14 and i will lay my vengeance upon edom by the hand of my people israel and they shall do in edom according to mine anger and according to my fury and they shall know my vengeance saith the lord god,bible-kjv
26 5 it shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea for i have spoken it saith the lord god and it shall become a spoil to the nations,bible-kjv
26 10 by reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen and of the wheels and of the chariots when he shall enter into thy gates as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach,bible-kjv
26 15 thus saith the lord god to tyrus shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall when the wounded cry when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee,bible-kjv
27 1 the word of the lord came again unto me saying 27 2 now thou son of man take up a lamentation for tyrus 27 3 and say unto tyrus o thou that art situate at the entry of the sea which art a merchant of the people for many isles thus saith the lord god o tyrus thou hast said i am of perfect beauty,bible-kjv
27 8 the inhabitants of zidon and arvad were thy mariners thy wise men o tyrus that were in thee were thy pilots,bible-kjv
27 13 javan tubal and meshech they were thy merchants they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market,bible-kjv
27 18 damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making for the multitude of all riches in the wine of helbon and white wool,bible-kjv
27 23 haran and canneh and eden the merchants of sheba asshur and chilmad were thy merchants,bible-kjv
27 28 the suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots,bible-kjv
27 35 all the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee and their kings shall be sore afraid they shall be troubled in their countenance,bible-kjv
but thou shalt be a man and no god in the hand of him that slayeth thee,bible-kjv
28 15 thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created till iniquity was found in thee,bible-kjv
28 20 again the word of the lord came unto me saying 28 21 son of man set thy face against zidon and prophesy against it 28 22 and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o zidon and i will be glorified in the midst of thee and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall have executed judgments in her and shall be sanctified in her,bible-kjv
29 1 in the tenth year in the tenth month in the twelfth day of the month the word of the lord came unto me saying 29 2 son of man set thy face against pharaoh king of egypt and prophesy against him and against all egypt 29 3 speak and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee pharaoh king of egypt the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers which hath said my river is mine own and i have made it for myself,bible-kjv
29 8 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will bring a sword upon thee and cut off man and beast out of thee,bible-kjv
29 13 yet thus saith the lord god at the end of forty years will i gather the egyptians from the people whither they were scattered 29 14 and i will bring again the captivity of egypt and will cause them to return into the land of pathros into the land of their habitation and they shall be there a base kingdom,bible-kjv
29 21 in that day will i cause the horn of the house of israel to bud forth and i will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them and they shall know that i am the lord,bible-kjv
30 6 thus saith the lord they also that uphold egypt shall fall and the pride of her power shall come down from the tower of syene shall they fall in it by the sword saith the lord god,bible-kjv
30 11 he and his people with him the terrible of the nations shall be brought to destroy the land and they shall draw their swords against egypt and fill the land with the slain,bible-kjv
30 16 and i will set fire in egypt sin shall have great pain and no shall be rent asunder and noph shall have distresses daily,bible-kjv
30 22 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against pharaoh king of egypt and will break his arms the strong and that which was broken and i will cause the sword to fall out of his hand,bible-kjv
31 1 and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the third month in the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying 31 2 son of man speak unto pharaoh king of egypt and to his multitude whom art thou like in thy greatness,bible-kjv
31 7 thus was he fair in his greatness in the length of his branches for his root was by great waters,bible-kjv
31 13 upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches 31 14 to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs neither their trees stand up in their height all that drink water for they are all delivered unto death to the nether parts of the earth in the midst of the children of men with them that go down to the pit,bible-kjv
yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of eden unto the nether parts of the earth thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword,bible-kjv
32 5 and i will lay thy flesh upon the mountains and fill the valleys with thy height,bible-kjv
32 10 yea i will make many people amazed at thee and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee when i shall brandish my sword before them and they shall tremble at every moment every man for his own life in the day of thy fall,bible-kjv
32 15 when i shall make the land of egypt desolate and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full when i shall smite all them that dwell therein then shall they know that i am the lord,bible-kjv
32 20 they shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword she is delivered to the sword draw her and all her multitudes,bible-kjv
32 26 there is meshech tubal and all her multitude her graves are round about him all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword though they caused their terror in the land of the living,bible-kjv
32 31 pharaoh shall see them and shall be comforted over all his multitude even pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword saith the lord god,bible-kjv
33 6 but if the watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned if the sword come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will i require at the watchman s hand,bible-kjv
33 11 say unto them as i live saith the lord god i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die o house of israel,bible-kjv
33 17 yet the children of thy people say the way of the lord is not equal but as for them their way is not equal,bible-kjv
33 21 and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity in the tenth month in the fifth day of the month that one that had escaped out of jerusalem came unto me saying the city is smitten,bible-kjv
33 27 say thou thus unto them thus saith the lord god as i live surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword and him that is in the open field will i give to the beasts to be devoured and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence,bible-kjv
33 32 and lo thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument for they hear thy words but they do them not,bible-kjv
34 4 the diseased have ye not strengthened neither have ye healed that which was sick neither have ye bound up that which was broken neither have ye brought again that which was driven away neither have ye sought that which was lost but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them,bible-kjv
34 12 as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered so will i seek out my sheep and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day,bible-kjv
34 17 and as for you o my flock thus saith the lord god behold i judge between cattle and cattle between the rams and the he goats,bible-kjv
34 21 because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder and pushed all the diseased with your horns till ye have scattered them abroad 34 22 therefore will i save my flock and they shall no more be a prey and i will judge between cattle and cattle,bible-kjv
34 27 and the tree of the field shall yield her fruit and the earth shall yield her increase and they shall be safe in their land and shall know that i am the lord when i have broken the bands of their yoke and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them,bible-kjv
35 1 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying 35 2 son of man set thy face against mount seir and prophesy against it 35 3 and say unto it thus saith the lord god behold o mount seir i am against thee and i will stretch out mine hand against thee and i will make thee most desolate,bible-kjv
35 9 i will make thee perpetual desolations and thy cities shall not return and ye shall know that i am the lord,bible-kjv
35 15 as thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of israel because it was desolate so will i do unto thee thou shalt be desolate o mount seir and all idumea even all of it and they shall know that i am the lord,bible-kjv
36 12 yea i will cause men to walk upon you even my people israel and they shall possess thee and thou shalt be their inheritance and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men,bible-kjv
36 20 and when they entered unto the heathen whither they went they profaned my holy name when they said to them these are the people of the lord and are gone forth out of his land,bible-kjv
36 25 then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you,bible-kjv
36 30 and i will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen,bible-kjv
36 35 and they shall say this land that was desolate is become like the garden of eden and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited,bible-kjv
37 3 and he said unto me son of man can these bones live,bible-kjv
37 8 and when i beheld lo the sinews and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them,bible-kjv
37 13 and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your graves o my people and brought you up out of your graves 37 14 and shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and i shall place you in your own land then shall ye know that i the lord have spoken it and performed it saith the lord,bible-kjv
37 21 and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold i will take the children of israel from among the heathen whither they be gone and will gather them on every side and bring them into their own land 37 22 and i will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of israel and one king shall be king to them all and they shall be no more two nations neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all,bible-kjv
37 27 my tabernacle also shall be with them yea i will be their god and they shall be my people,bible-kjv
38 9 thou shalt ascend and come like a storm thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land thou and all thy bands and many people with thee,bible-kjv
38 14 therefore son of man prophesy and say unto gog thus saith the lord god in that day when my people of israel dwelleth safely shalt thou not know it,bible-kjv
38 21 and i will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains saith the lord god every man s sword shall be against his brother,bible-kjv
39 5 thou shalt fall upon the open field for i have spoken it saith the lord god,bible-kjv
39 11 and it shall come to pass in that day that i will give unto gog a place there of graves in israel the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea and it shall stop the noses of the passengers and there shall they bury gog and all his multitude and they shall call it the valley of hamongog,bible-kjv
39 16 and also the name of the city shall be hamonah,bible-kjv
39 20 thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots with mighty men and with all men of war saith the lord god,bible-kjv
39 25 therefore thus saith the lord god now will i bring again the captivity of jacob and have mercy upon the whole house of israel and will be jealous for my holy name 39 26 after that they have borne their shame and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me when they dwelt safely in their land and none made them afraid,bible-kjv
40 3 and he brought me thither and behold there was a man whose appearance was like the appearance of brass with a line of flax in his hand and a measuring reed and he stood in the gate,bible-kjv
40 8 he measured also the porch of the gate within one reed,bible-kjv
40 13 he measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber to the roof of another the breadth was five and twenty cubits door against door,bible-kjv
40 18 and the pavement by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates was the lower pavement,bible-kjv
40 23 and the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north and toward the east and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits,bible-kjv
40 28 and he brought me to the inner court by the south gate and he measured the south gate according to these measures 40 29 and the little chambers thereof and the posts thereof and the arches thereof according to these measures and there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about it was fifty cubits long and five and twenty cubits broad,bible-kjv
40 34 and the arches thereof were toward the outward court and palm trees were upon the posts thereof on this side and on that side and the going up to it had eight steps,bible-kjv
40 40 and at the side without as one goeth up to the entry of the north gate were two tables and on the other side which was at the porch of the gate were two tables,bible-kjv
40 45 and he said unto me this chamber whose prospect is toward the south is for the priests the keepers of the charge of the house,bible-kjv
41 1 afterward he brought me to the temple and measured the posts six cubits broad on the one side and six cubits broad on the other side which was the breadth of the tabernacle,bible-kjv
41 6 and the side chambers were three one over another and thirty in order and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the side chambers round about that they might have hold but they had not hold in the wall of the house,bible-kjv
41 11 and the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that was left one door toward the north and another door toward the south and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round about,bible-kjv
41 20 from the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm trees made and on the wall of the temple,bible-kjv
41 25 and there were made on them on the doors of the temple cherubims and palm trees like as were made upon the walls and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without,bible-kjv
42 4 and before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth inward a way of one cubit and their doors toward the north,bible-kjv
42 9 and from under these chambers was the entry on the east side as one goeth into them from the utter court,bible-kjv
42 14 when the priests enter therein then shall they not go out of the holy place into the utter court but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister for they are holy and shall put on other garments and shall approach to those things which are for the people,bible-kjv
42 19 he turned about to the west side and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed,bible-kjv
43 5 so the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court and behold the glory of the lord filled the house,bible-kjv
43 10 thou son of man shew the house to the house of israel that they may be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure the pattern,bible-kjv
43 14 and from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle shall be two cubits and the breadth one cubit and from the lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits and the breadth one cubit,bible-kjv
43 19 and thou shalt give to the priests the levites that be of the seed of zadok which approach unto me to minister unto me saith the lord god a young bullock for a sin offering,bible-kjv
43 24 and thou shalt offer them before the lord and the priests shall cast salt upon them and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the lord,bible-kjv
44 2 then said the lord unto me this gate shall be shut it shall not be opened and no man shall enter in by it because the lord the god of israel hath entered in by it therefore it shall be shut,bible-kjv
44 8 and ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves,bible-kjv
44 13 and they shall not come near unto me to do the office of a priest unto me nor to come near to any of my holy things in the most holy place but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed,bible-kjv
44 19 and when they go forth into the utter court even into the utter court to the people they shall put off their garments wherein they ministered and lay them in the holy chambers and they shall put on other garments and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments,bible-kjv
44 24 and in controversy they shall stand in judgment and they shall judge it according to my judgments and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies and they shall hallow my sabbaths,bible-kjv
44 29 they shall eat the meat offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering and every dedicated thing in israel shall be theirs,bible-kjv
45 2 of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length with five hundred in breadth square round about and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof,bible-kjv
45 7 and a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion and of the possession of the city before the oblation of the holy portion and before the possession of the city from the west side westward and from the east side eastward and the length shall be over against one of the portions from the west border unto the east border,bible-kjv
45 12 and the shekel shall be twenty gerahs twenty shekels five and twenty shekels fifteen shekels shall be your maneh,bible-kjv
45 20 and so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth and for him that is simple so shall ye reconcile the house,bible-kjv
45 25 in the seventh month in the fifteenth day of the month shall he do the like in the feast of the seven days according to the sin offering according to the burnt offering and according to the meat offering and according to the oil,bible-kjv
46 5 and the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram and the meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give and an hin of oil to an ephah,bible-kjv
46 10 and the prince in the midst of them when they go in shall go in and when they go forth shall go forth,bible-kjv
46 15 thus shall they prepare the lamb and the meat offering and the oil every morning for a continual burnt offering,bible-kjv
46 20 then said he unto me this is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering where they shall bake the meat offering that they bear them not out into the utter court to sanctify the people,bible-kjv
47 1 afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward for the forefront of the house stood toward the east and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house at the south side of the altar,bible-kjv
47 5 afterward he measured a thousand and it was a river that i could not pass over for the waters were risen waters to swim in a river that could not be passed over,bible-kjv
47 9 and it shall come to pass that every thing that liveth which moveth whithersoever the rivers shall come shall live and there shall be a very great multitude of fish because these waters shall come thither for they shall be healed and every thing shall live whither the river cometh,bible-kjv
47 14 and ye shall inherit it one as well as another concerning the which i lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance,bible-kjv
and this is the east side,bible-kjv
47 21 so shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes of israel,bible-kjv
48 2 and by the border of dan from the east side unto the west side a portion for asher,bible-kjv
48 7 and by the border of reuben from the east side unto the west side a portion for judah,bible-kjv
48 12 and this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto them a thing most holy by the border of the levites,bible-kjv
48 17 and the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty and toward the south two hundred and fifty and toward the east two hundred and fifty and toward the west two hundred and fifty,bible-kjv
48 22 moreover from the possession of the levites and from the possession of the city being in the midst of that which is the prince s between the border of judah and the border of benjamin shall be for the prince,bible-kjv
48 27 and by the border of zebulun from the east side unto the west side gad a portion,bible-kjv
48 32 and at the east side four thousand and five hundred and three gates and one gate of joseph one gate of benjamin one gate of dan,bible-kjv
1 1 in the third year of the reign of jehoiakim king of judah came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto jerusalem and besieged it,bible-kjv
1 8 but daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king s meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself,bible-kjv
1 13 then let our countenances be looked upon before thee and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king s meat and as thou seest deal with thy servants,bible-kjv
1 18 now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before nebuchadnezzar,bible-kjv
2 2 then the king commanded to call the magicians and the astrologers and the sorcerers and the chaldeans for to shew the king his dreams,bible-kjv
2 6 but if ye shew the dream and the interpretation thereof ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour therefore shew me the dream and the interpretation thereof,bible-kjv
2 11 and it is a rare thing that the king requireth and there is none other that can shew it before the king except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh,bible-kjv
2 16 then daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him time and that he would shew the king the interpretation,bible-kjv
2 23 i thank thee and praise thee o thou god of my fathers who hast given me wisdom and might and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee for thou hast now made known unto us the king s matter,bible-kjv
thy dream and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these 2 29 as for thee o king thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed what should come to pass hereafter and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass,bible-kjv
2 34 thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and brake them to pieces,bible-kjv
thou art this head of gold,bible-kjv
2 43 and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay,bible-kjv
2 48 then the king made daniel a great man and gave him many great gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of babylon and chief of the governors over all the wise men of babylon,bible-kjv
3 4 then an herald cried aloud to you it is commanded o people nations and languages 3 5 that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery dulcimer and all kinds of musick ye fall down and worship the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up 3 6 and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace,bible-kjv
3 12 there are certain jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of babylon shadrach meshach and abednego these men o king have not regarded thee they serve not thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up,bible-kjv
3 16 shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter,bible-kjv
3 21 then these men were bound in their coats their hosen and their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace,bible-kjv
3 25 he answered and said lo i see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the son of god,bible-kjv
3 29 therefore i make a decree that every people nation and language which speak any thing amiss against the god of shadrach meshach and abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dunghill because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort,bible-kjv
and how mighty are his wonders,bible-kjv
4 8 but at the last daniel came in before me whose name was belteshazzar according to the name of my god and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and before him i told the dream saying 4 9 o belteshazzar master of the magicians because i know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee and no secret troubleth thee tell me the visions of my dream that i have seen and the interpretation thereof,bible-kjv
4 18 this dream i king nebuchadnezzar have seen,bible-kjv
4 20 the tree that thou sawest which grew and was strong whose height reached unto the heaven and the sight thereof to all the earth 4 21 whose leaves were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it was meat for all under which the beasts of the field dwelt and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation 4 22 it is thou o king that art grown and become strong for thy greatness is grown and reacheth unto heaven and thy dominion to the end of the earth,bible-kjv
4 29 at the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of babylon,bible-kjv
4 34 and at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven and mine understanding returned unto me and i blessed the most high and i praised and honoured him that liveth for ever whose dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generation 4 35 and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou,bible-kjv
5 3 then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of god which was at jerusalem and the king and his princes his wives and his concubines drank in them,bible-kjv
and the king spake and said to the wise men of babylon whosoever shall read this writing and shew me the interpretation thereof shall be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom,bible-kjv
and the king spake and said unto daniel art thou that daniel which art of the children of the captivity of judah whom the king my father brought out of jewry,bible-kjv
5 20 but when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pride he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him 5 21 and he was driven from the sons of men and his heart was made like the beasts and his dwelling was with the wild asses they fed him with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till he knew that the most high god ruled in the kingdom of men and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will,bible-kjv
5 28 peres thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians,bible-kjv
6 3 then this daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes because an excellent spirit was in him and the king thought to set him over the whole realm,bible-kjv
6 8 now o king establish the decree and sign the writing that it be not changed according to the law of the medes and persians which altereth not,bible-kjv
the king answered and said the thing is true according to the law of the medes and persians which altereth not,bible-kjv
now the king spake and said unto daniel thy god whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee,bible-kjv
6 21 then said daniel unto the king o king live for ever,bible-kjv
6 25 then king darius wrote unto all people nations and languages that dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you,bible-kjv
7 2 daniel spake and said i saw in my vision by night and behold the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea,bible-kjv
7 7 after this i saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beast dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had great iron teeth it devoured and brake in pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it and it had ten horns,bible-kjv
7 12 as concerning the rest of the beasts they had their dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time,bible-kjv
so he told me and made me know the interpretation of the things,bible-kjv
7 23 thus he said the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces,bible-kjv
7 28 hitherto is the end of the matter,bible-kjv
8 4 i saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward so that no beasts might stand before him neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand but he did according to his will and became great,bible-kjv
8 9 and out of one of them came forth a little horn which waxed exceeding great toward the south and toward the east and toward the pleasant land,bible-kjv
8 14 and he said unto me unto two thousand and three hundred days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed,bible-kjv
8 19 and he said behold i will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation for at the time appointed the end shall be,bible-kjv
8 24 and his power shall be mighty but not by his own power and he shall destroy wonderfully and shall prosper and practise and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people,bible-kjv
9 3 and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes 9 4 and i prayed unto the lord my god and made my confession and said o lord the great and dreadful god keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his commandments 9 5 we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments 9 6 neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets which spake in thy name to our kings our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land,bible-kjv
9 12 and he hath confirmed his words which he spake against us and against our judges that judged us by bringing upon us a great evil for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon jerusalem,bible-kjv
9 17 now therefore o our god hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate for the lord s sake,bible-kjv
9 23 at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth and i am come to shew thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision,bible-kjv
10 1 in the third year of cyrus king of persia a thing was revealed unto daniel whose name was called belteshazzar and the thing was true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and had understanding of the vision,bible-kjv
10 8 therefore i was left alone and saw this great vision and there remained no strength in me for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption and i retained no strength,bible-kjv
10 12 then said he unto me fear not daniel for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words,bible-kjv
10 17 for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord,bible-kjv
and now will i return to fight with the prince of persia and when i am gone forth lo the prince of grecia shall come,bible-kjv
11 3 and a mighty king shall stand up that shall rule with great dominion and do according to his will,bible-kjv
11 9 so the king of the south shall come into his kingdom and shall return into his own land,bible-kjv
11 14 and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision but they shall fall,bible-kjv
11 19 then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land but he shall stumble and fall and not be found,bible-kjv
11 24 he shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province and he shall do that which his fathers have not done nor his fathers fathers he shall scatter among them the prey and spoil and riches yea and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds even for a time,bible-kjv
11 29 at the time appointed he shall return and come toward the south but it shall not be as the former or as the latter,bible-kjv
11 34 now when they shall fall they shall be holpen with a little help but many shall cleave to them with flatteries,bible-kjv
11 39 thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory and he shall cause them to rule over many and shall divide the land for gain,bible-kjv
11 44 but tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to make away many,bible-kjv
12 4 but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased,bible-kjv
12 9 and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end,bible-kjv
hosea,bible-kjv
1 4 and the lord said unto him call his name jezreel for yet a little while and i will avenge the blood of jezreel upon the house of jehu and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of israel,bible-kjv
1 8 now when she had weaned loruhamah she conceived and bare a son,bible-kjv
2 2 plead with your mother plead for she is not my wife neither am i her husband let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight and her adulteries from between her breasts 2 3 lest i strip her naked and set her as in the day that she was born and make her as a wilderness and set her like a dry land and slay her with thirst,bible-kjv
2 8 for she did not know that i gave her corn and wine and oil and multiplied her silver and gold which they prepared for baal,bible-kjv
2 13 and i will visit upon her the days of baalim wherein she burned incense to them and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels and she went after her lovers and forgat me saith the lord,bible-kjv
2 18 and in that day will i make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven and with the creeping things of the ground and i will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth and will make them to lie down safely,bible-kjv
3 1 then said the lord unto me go yet love a woman beloved of her friend yet an adulteress according to the love of the lord toward the children of israel who look to other gods and love flagons of wine,bible-kjv
4 3 therefore shall the land mourn and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven yea the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away,bible-kjv
4 8 they eat up the sin of my people and they set their heart on their iniquity,bible-kjv
4 13 they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains and burn incense upon the hills under oaks and poplars and elms because the shadow thereof is good therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom and your spouses shall commit adultery,bible-kjv
4 18 their drink is sour they have committed whoredom continually her rulers with shame do love give ye,bible-kjv
5 4 they will not frame their doings to turn unto their god for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them and they have not known the lord,bible-kjv
5 9 ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke among the tribes of israel have i made known that which shall surely be,bible-kjv
5 14 for i will be unto ephraim as a lion and as a young lion to the house of judah i even i will tear and go away i will take away and none shall rescue him,bible-kjv
6 4 o ephraim what shall i do unto thee,bible-kjv
6 7 but they like men have transgressed the covenant there have they dealt treacherously against me,bible-kjv
7 1 when i would have healed israel then the iniquity of ephraim was discovered and the wickedness of samaria for they commit falsehood and the thief cometh in and the troop of robbers spoileth without,bible-kjv
7 6 for they have made ready their heart like an oven whiles they lie in wait their baker sleepeth all the night in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire,bible-kjv
7 11 ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart they call to egypt they go to assyria,bible-kjv
7 14 and they have not cried unto me with their heart when they howled upon their beds they assemble themselves for corn and wine and they rebel against me,bible-kjv
8 2 israel shall cry unto me my god we know thee,bible-kjv
8 7 for they have sown the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind it hath no stalk the bud shall yield no meal if so be it yield the strangers shall swallow it up,bible-kjv
8 12 i have written to him the great things of my law but they were counted as a strange thing,bible-kjv
9 3 they shall not dwell in the lord s land but ephraim shall return to egypt and they shall eat unclean things in assyria,bible-kjv
9 8 the watchman of ephraim was with my god but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways and hatred in the house of his god,bible-kjv
9 13 ephraim as i saw tyrus is planted in a pleasant place but ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer,bible-kjv
9 17 my god will cast them away because they did not hearken unto him and they shall be wanderers among the nations,bible-kjv
10 5 the inhabitants of samaria shall fear because of the calves of bethaven for the people thereof shall mourn over it and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it for the glory thereof because it is departed from it,bible-kjv
10 10 it is in my desire that i should chastise them and the people shall be gathered against them when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows,bible-kjv
10 15 so shall bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness in a morning shall the king of israel utterly be cut off,bible-kjv
11 5 he shall not return into the land of egypt and the assyrian shall be his king because they refused to return,bible-kjv
how shall i make thee as admah,bible-kjv
11 11 they shall tremble as a bird out of egypt and as a dove out of the land of assyria and i will place them in their houses saith the lord,bible-kjv
12 6 therefore turn thou to thy god keep mercy and judgment and wait on thy god continually,bible-kjv
12 11 is there iniquity in gilead,bible-kjv
13 1 when ephraim spake trembling he exalted himself in israel but when he offended in baal he died,bible-kjv
13 6 according to their pasture so were they filled they were filled and their heart was exalted therefore have they forgotten me,bible-kjv
13 11 i gave thee a king in mine anger and took him away in my wrath,bible-kjv
13 16 samaria shall become desolate for she hath rebelled against her god they shall fall by the sword their infants shall be dashed in pieces and their women with child shall be ripped up,bible-kjv
14 5 i will be as the dew unto israel he shall grow as the lily and cast forth his roots as lebanon,bible-kjv
from me is thy fruit found,bible-kjv
1 1 the word of the lord that came to joel the son of pethuel,bible-kjv
1 5 awake ye drunkards and weep and howl all ye drinkers of wine because of the new wine for it is cut off from your mouth,bible-kjv
1 10 the field is wasted the land mourneth for the corn is wasted the new wine is dried up the oil languisheth,bible-kjv
for the day of the lord is at hand and as a destruction from the almighty shall it come,bible-kjv
1 19 o lord to thee will i cry for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field,bible-kjv
2 5 like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble as a strong people set in battle array,bible-kjv
2 12 therefore also now saith the lord turn ye even to me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning 2 13 and rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the lord your god for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of the evil,bible-kjv
2 19 yea the lord will answer and say unto his people behold i will send you corn and wine and oil and ye shall be satisfied therewith and i will no more make you a reproach among the heathen 2 20 but i will remove far off from you the northern army and will drive him into a land barren and desolate with his face toward the east sea and his hinder part toward the utmost sea and his stink shall come up and his ill savour shall come up because he hath done great things,bible-kjv
2 25 and i will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpiller and the palmerworm my great army which i sent among you,bible-kjv
2 31 the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come,bible-kjv
will ye render me a recompence,bible-kjv
3 12 let the heathen be wakened and come up to the valley of jehoshaphat for there will i sit to judge all the heathen round about,bible-kjv
3 17 so shall ye know that i am the lord your god dwelling in zion my holy mountain then shall jerusalem be holy and there shall no strangers pass through her any more,bible-kjv
amos,bible-kjv
1 6 thus saith the lord for three transgressions of gaza and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they carried away captive the whole captivity to deliver them up to edom 1 7 but i will send a fire on the wall of gaza which shall devour the palaces thereof 1 8 and i will cut off the inhabitant from ashdod and him that holdeth the sceptre from ashkelon and i will turn mine hand against ekron and the remnant of the philistines shall perish saith the lord god,bible-kjv
2 4 thus saith the lord for three transgressions of judah and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have despised the law of the lord and have not kept his commandments and their lies caused them to err after the which their fathers have walked 2 5 but i will send a fire upon judah and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem,bible-kjv
is it not even thus o ye children of israel,bible-kjv
2 16 and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day saith the lord,bible-kjv
3 5 can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth where no gin is for him,bible-kjv
3 8 the lion hath roared who will not fear,bible-kjv
3 12 thus saith the lord as the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs or a piece of an ear so shall the children of israel be taken out that dwell in samaria in the corner of a bed and in damascus in a couch,bible-kjv
4 3 and ye shall go out at the breaches every cow at that which is before her and ye shall cast them into the palace saith the lord,bible-kjv
4 9 i have smitten you with blasting and mildew when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased the palmerworm devoured them yet have ye not returned unto me saith the lord,bible-kjv
5 1 hear ye this word which i take up against you even a lamentation o house of israel,bible-kjv
5 7 ye who turn judgment to wormwood and leave off righteousness in the earth 5 8 seek him that maketh the seven stars and orion and turneth the shadow of death into the morning and maketh the day dark with night that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth the lord is his name 5 9 that strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress,bible-kjv
5 14 seek good and not evil that ye may live and so the lord the god of hosts shall be with you as ye have spoken,bible-kjv
5 17 and in all vineyards shall be wailing for i will pass through thee saith the lord,bible-kjv
5 20 shall not the day of the lord be darkness and not light,bible-kjv
5 24 but let judgment run down as waters and righteousness as a mighty stream,bible-kjv
6 2 pass ye unto calneh and see and from thence go ye to hamath the great then go down to gath of the philistines be they better than these kingdoms,bible-kjv
6 9 and it shall come to pass if there remain ten men in one house that they shall die,bible-kjv
6 12 shall horses run upon the rock,bible-kjv
7 2 and it came to pass that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land then i said o lord god forgive i beseech thee by whom shall jacob arise,bible-kjv
for he is small,bible-kjv
then said the lord behold i will set a plumbline in the midst of my people israel i will not again pass by them any more 7 9 and the high places of isaac shall be desolate and the sanctuaries of israel shall be laid waste and i will rise against the house of jeroboam with the sword,bible-kjv
7 16 now therefore hear thou the word of the lord thou sayest prophesy not against israel and drop not thy word against the house of isaac,bible-kjv
then said the lord unto me the end is come upon my people of israel i will not again pass by them any more,bible-kjv
8 7 the lord hath sworn by the excellency of jacob surely i will never forget any of their works,bible-kjv
8 13 in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst,bible-kjv
9 6 it is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven and hath founded his troop in the earth he that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth the lord is his name,bible-kjv
9 8 behold the eyes of the lord god are upon the sinful kingdom and i will destroy it from off the face of the earth saving that i will not utterly destroy the house of jacob saith the lord,bible-kjv
9 14 and i will bring again the captivity of my people of israel and they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof they shall also make gardens and eat the fruit of them,bible-kjv
1 2 behold i have made thee small among the heathen thou art greatly despised,bible-kjv
if the grapegatherers came to thee would they not leave some grapes,bible-kjv
1 9 and thy mighty men o teman shall be dismayed to the end that every one of the mount of esau may be cut off by slaughter,bible-kjv
1 15 for the day of the lord is near upon all the heathen as thou hast done it shall be done unto thee thy reward shall return upon thine own head,bible-kjv
1 20 and the captivity of this host of the children of israel shall possess that of the canaanites even unto zarephath and the captivity of jerusalem which is in sepharad shall possess the cities of the south,bible-kjv
1 4 but the lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken,bible-kjv
1 7 and they said every one to his fellow come and let us cast lots that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us,bible-kjv
and of what people art thou,bible-kjv
1 11 then said they unto him what shall we do unto thee that the sea may be calm unto us,bible-kjv
1 15 so they look up jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the sea ceased from her raging,bible-kjv
2 3 for thou hadst cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas and the floods compassed me about all thy billows and thy waves passed over me,bible-kjv
2 8 they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy,bible-kjv
3 3 so jonah arose and went unto nineveh according to the word of the lord,bible-kjv
3 7 and he caused it to be proclaimed and published through nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles saying let neither man nor beast herd nor flock taste any thing let them not feed nor drink water 3 8 but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto god yea let them turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands,bible-kjv
therefore i fled before unto tarshish for i knew that thou art a gracious god and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repentest thee of the evil,bible-kjv
so jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd,bible-kjv
4 10 then said the lord thou hast had pity on the gourd for the which thou hast not laboured neither madest it grow which came up in a night and perished in a night 4 11 and should not i spare nineveh that great city wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and also much cattle,bible-kjv
1 4 and the mountains shall be molten under him and the valleys shall be cleft as wax before the fire and as the waters that are poured down a steep place,bible-kjv
are they not jerusalem,bible-kjv
1 10 declare ye it not at gath weep ye not at all in the house of aphrah roll thyself in the dust,bible-kjv
1 15 yet will i bring an heir unto thee o inhabitant of mareshah he shall come unto adullam the glory of israel,bible-kjv
2 3 therefore thus saith the lord behold against this family do i devise an evil from which ye shall not remove your necks neither shall ye go haughtily for this time is evil,bible-kjv
2 7 o thou that art named the house of jacob is the spirit of the lord straitened,bible-kjv
2 10 arise ye and depart for this is not your rest because it is polluted it shall destroy you even with a sore destruction,bible-kjv
3 2 who hate the good and love the evil who pluck off their skin from off them and their flesh from off their bones 3 3 who also eat the flesh of my people and flay their skin from off them and they break their bones and chop them in pieces as for the pot and as flesh within the caldron,bible-kjv
3 8 but truly i am full of power by the spirit of the lord and of judgment and of might to declare unto jacob his transgression and to israel his sin,bible-kjv
3 12 therefore shall zion for your sake be plowed as a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest,bible-kjv
4 5 for all people will walk every one in the name of his god and we will walk in the name of the lord our god for ever and ever,bible-kjv
is thy counsellor perished,bible-kjv
4 13 arise and thresh o daughter of zion for i will make thine horn iron and i will make thy hoofs brass and thou shalt beat in pieces many people and i will consecrate their gain unto the lord and their substance unto the lord of the whole earth,bible-kjv
5 5 and this man shall be the peace when the assyrian shall come into our land and when he shall tread in our palaces then shall we raise against him seven shepherds and eight principal men,bible-kjv
5 10 and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord that i will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee and i will destroy thy chariots 5 11 and i will cut off the cities of thy land and throw down all thy strong holds 5 12 and i will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand and thou shalt have no more soothsayers 5 13 thy graven images also will i cut off and thy standing images out of the midst of thee and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands,bible-kjv
6 3 o my people what have i done unto thee,bible-kjv
6 6 wherewith shall i come before the lord and bow myself before the high god,bible-kjv
6 9 the lord s voice crieth unto the city and the man of wisdom shall see thy name hear ye the rod and who hath appointed it,bible-kjv
6 14 thou shalt eat but not be satisfied and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee and thou shalt take hold but shalt not deliver and that which thou deliverest will i give up to the sword,bible-kjv
7 2 the good man is perished out of the earth and there is none upright among men they all lie in wait for blood they hunt every man his brother with a net,bible-kjv
7 7 therefore i will look unto the lord i will wait for the god of my salvation my god will hear me,bible-kjv
7 11 in the day that thy walls are to be built in that day shall the decree be far removed,bible-kjv
7 16 the nations shall see and be confounded at all their might they shall lay their hand upon their mouth their ears shall be deaf,bible-kjv
7 20 thou wilt perform the truth to jacob and the mercy to abraham which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old,bible-kjv
1 3 the lord is slow to anger and great in power and will not at all acquit the wicked the lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm and the clouds are the dust of his feet,bible-kjv
his fury is poured out like fire and the rocks are thrown down by him,bible-kjv
1 10 for while they be folden together as thorns and while they are drunken as drunkards they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry,bible-kjv
1 14 and the lord hath given a commandment concerning thee that no more of thy name be sown out of the house of thy gods will i cut off the graven image and the molten image i will make thy grave for thou art vile,bible-kjv
2 3 the shield of his mighty men is made red the valiant men are in scarlet the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken,bible-kjv
2 8 but nineveh is of old like a pool of water yet they shall flee away,bible-kjv
2 12 the lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps and strangled for his lionesses and filled his holes with prey and his dens with ravin,bible-kjv
3 5 behold i am against thee saith the lord of hosts and i will discover thy skirts upon thy face and i will shew the nations thy nakedness and the kingdoms thy shame,bible-kjv
3 9 ethiopia and egypt were her strength and it was infinite put and lubim were thy helpers,bible-kjv
3 14 draw thee waters for the siege fortify thy strong holds go into clay and tread the morter make strong the brickkiln,bible-kjv
3 19 there is no healing of thy bruise thy wound is grievous all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually,bible-kjv
1 3 why dost thou shew me iniquity and cause me to behold grievance,bible-kjv
1 7 they are terrible and dreadful their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves,bible-kjv
1 12 art thou not from everlasting o lord my god mine holy one,bible-kjv
1 15 they take up all of them with the angle they catch them in their net and gather them in their drag therefore they rejoice and are glad,bible-kjv
2 3 for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry,bible-kjv
2 7 shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee and awake that shall vex thee and thou shalt be for booties unto them,bible-kjv
2 12 woe to him that buildeth a town with blood and stablisheth a city by iniquity,bible-kjv
2 17 for the violence of lebanon shall cover thee and the spoil of beasts which made them afraid because of men s blood and for the violence of the land of the city and of all that dwell therein,bible-kjv
3 1 a prayer of habakkuk the prophet upon shigionoth,bible-kjv
3 4 and his brightness was as the light he had horns coming out of his hand and there was the hiding of his power,bible-kjv
was thine anger against the rivers,bible-kjv
3 10 the mountains saw thee and they trembled the overflowing of the water passed by the deep uttered his voice and lifted up his hands on high,bible-kjv
3 14 thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly,bible-kjv
to the chief singer on my stringed instruments,bible-kjv
1 4 i will also stretch out mine hand upon judah and upon all the inhabitants of jerusalem and i will cut off the remnant of baal from this place and the name of the chemarims with the priests 1 5 and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops and them that worship and that swear by the lord and that swear by malcham 1 6 and them that are turned back from the lord and those that have not sought the lord nor enquired for him,bible-kjv
1 11 howl ye inhabitants of maktesh for all the merchant people are cut down all they that bear silver are cut off,bible-kjv
1 17 and i will bring distress upon men that they shall walk like blind men because they have sinned against the lord and their blood shall be poured out as dust and their flesh as the dung,bible-kjv
2 5 woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast the nation of the cherethites,bible-kjv
2 9 therefore as i live saith the lord of hosts the god of israel surely moab shall be as sodom and the children of ammon as gomorrah even the breeding of nettles and saltpits and a perpetual desolation the residue of my people shall spoil them and the remnant of my people shall possess them,bible-kjv
2 14 and flocks shall lie down in the midst of her all the beasts of the nations both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it their voice shall sing in the windows desolation shall be in the thresholds for he shall uncover the cedar work,bible-kjv
3 3 her princes within her are roaring lions her judges are evening wolves they gnaw not the bones till the morrow,bible-kjv
3 8 therefore wait ye upon me saith the lord until the day that i rise up to the prey for my determination is to gather the nations that i may assemble the kingdoms to pour upon them mine indignation even all my fierce anger for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy,bible-kjv
3 13 the remnant of israel shall not do iniquity nor speak lies neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth for they shall feed and lie down and none shall make them afraid,bible-kjv
3 18 i will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly who are of thee to whom the reproach of it was a burden,bible-kjv
1 3 then came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet saying 1 4 is it time for you o ye to dwell in your cieled houses and this house lie waste,bible-kjv
1 9 ye looked for much and lo it came to little and when ye brought it home i did blow upon it,bible-kjv
1 11 and i called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the corn and upon the new wine and upon the oil and upon that which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle and upon all the labour of the hands,bible-kjv
and how do ye see it now,bible-kjv
2 9 the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former saith the lord of hosts and in this place will i give peace saith the lord of hosts,bible-kjv
2 14 then answered haggai and said so is this people and so is this nation before me saith the lord and so is every work of their hands and that which they offer there is unclean,bible-kjv
yea as yet the vine and the fig tree and the pomegranate and the olive tree hath not brought forth from this day will i bless you,bible-kjv
1 3 therefore say thou unto them thus saith the lord of hosts turn ye unto me saith the lord of hosts and i will turn unto you saith the lord of hosts,bible-kjv
and they returned and said like as the lord of hosts thought to do unto us according to our ways and according to our doings so hath he dealt with us,bible-kjv
1 11 and they answered the angel of the lord that stood among the myrtle trees and said we have walked to and fro through the earth and behold all the earth sitteth still and is at rest,bible-kjv
1 16 therefore thus saith the lord i am returned to jerusalem with mercies my house shall be built in it saith the lord of hosts and a line shall be stretched forth upon jerusalem,bible-kjv
1 20 and the lord shewed me four carpenters,bible-kjv
and he said unto me to measure jerusalem to see what is the breadth thereof and what is the length thereof,bible-kjv
2 9 for behold i will shake mine hand upon them and they shall be a spoil to their servants and ye shall know that the lord of hosts hath sent me,bible-kjv
3 1 and he shewed me joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the lord and satan standing at his right hand to resist him,bible-kjv
3 5 and i said let them set a fair mitre upon his head,bible-kjv
3 9 for behold the stone that i have laid before joshua upon one stone shall be seven eyes behold i will engrave the graving thereof saith the lord of hosts and i will remove the iniquity of that land in one day,bible-kjv
4 4 so i answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord,bible-kjv
before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it,bible-kjv
4 12 and i answered again and said unto him what be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves,bible-kjv
5 2 and he said unto me what seest thou,bible-kjv
5 6 and i said what is it,bible-kjv
and he cast it into the midst of the ephah and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof,bible-kjv
6 2 in the first chariot were red horses and in the second chariot black horses 6 3 and in the third chariot white horses and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses,bible-kjv
so they walked to and fro through the earth,bible-kjv
and this shall come to pass if ye will diligently obey the voice of the lord your god,bible-kjv
7 8 and the word of the lord came unto zechariah saying 7 9 thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying execute true judgment and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother 7 10 and oppress not the widow nor the fatherless the stranger nor the poor and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart,bible-kjv
8 1 again the word of the lord of hosts came to me saying 8 2 thus saith the lord of hosts i was jealous for zion with great jealousy and i was jealous for her with great fury,bible-kjv
saith the lord of hosts,bible-kjv
8 12 for the seed shall be prosperous the vine shall give her fruit and the ground shall give her increase and the heavens shall give their dew and i will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things,bible-kjv
8 20 thus saith the lord of hosts it shall yet come to pass that there shall come people and the inhabitants of many cities 8 21 and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another saying let us go speedily to pray before the lord and to seek the lord of hosts i will go also,bible-kjv
9 3 and tyrus did build herself a strong hold and heaped up silver as the dust and fine gold as the mire of the streets,bible-kjv
9 8 and i will encamp about mine house because of the army because of him that passeth by and because of him that returneth and no oppressor shall pass through them any more for now have i seen with mine eyes,bible-kjv
9 14 and the lord shall be seen over them and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning and the lord god shall blow the trumpet and shall go with whirlwinds of the south,bible-kjv
10 1 ask ye of the lord rain in the time of the latter rain so the lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to every one grass in the field,bible-kjv
10 6 and i will strengthen the house of judah and i will save the house of joseph and i will bring them again to place them for i have mercy upon them and they shall be as though i had not cast them off for i am the lord their god and will hear them,bible-kjv
10 11 and he shall pass through the sea with affliction and shall smite the waves in the sea and all the deeps of the river shall dry up and the pride of assyria shall be brought down and the sceptre of egypt shall depart away,bible-kjv
11 4 thus saith the lord my god feed the flock of the slaughter 11 5 whose possessors slay them and hold themselves not guilty and they that sell them say blessed be the lord for i am rich and their own shepherds pity them not,bible-kjv
11 9 then said i i will not feed you that that dieth let it die and that that is to be cut off let it be cut off and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another,bible-kjv
11 13 and the lord said unto me cast it unto the potter a goodly price that i was prised at of them,bible-kjv
11 17 woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock,bible-kjv
12 4 in that day saith the lord i will smite every horse with astonishment and his rider with madness and i will open mine eyes upon the house of judah and will smite every horse of the people with blindness,bible-kjv
12 9 and it shall come to pass in that day that i will seek to destroy all the nations that come against jerusalem,bible-kjv
13 2 and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts that i will cut off the names of the idols out of the land and they shall no more be remembered and also i will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land,bible-kjv
13 7 awake o sword against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow saith the lord of hosts smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered and i will turn mine hand upon the little ones,bible-kjv
14 3 then shall the lord go forth and fight against those nations as when he fought in the day of battle,bible-kjv
14 9 and the lord shall be king over all the earth in that day shall there be one lord and his name one,bible-kjv
14 14 and judah also shall fight at jerusalem and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together gold and silver and apparel in great abundance,bible-kjv
14 19 this shall be the punishment of egypt and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles,bible-kjv
1 2 i have loved you saith the lord,bible-kjv
1 5 and your eyes shall see and ye shall say the lord will be magnified from the border of israel,bible-kjv
1 7 ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar and ye say wherein have we polluted thee,bible-kjv
saith the lord of hosts,bible-kjv
i have no pleasure in you saith the lord of hosts neither will i accept an offering at your hand,bible-kjv
saith the lord,bible-kjv
2 4 and ye shall know that i have sent this commandment unto you that my covenant might be with levi saith the lord of hosts,bible-kjv
2 9 therefore have i also made you contemptible and base before all the people according as ye have not kept my ways but have been partial in the law,bible-kjv
2 12 the lord will cut off the man that doeth this the master and the scholar out of the tabernacles of jacob and him that offereth an offering unto the lord of hosts,bible-kjv
yet had he the residue of the spirit,bible-kjv
2 17 ye have wearied the lord with your words,bible-kjv
and who shall stand when he appeareth,bible-kjv
3 7 even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them,bible-kjv
but ye say wherein have we robbed thee,bible-kjv
3 12 and all nations shall call you blessed for ye shall be a delightsome land saith the lord of hosts,bible-kjv
3 16 then they that feared the lord spake often one to another and the lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord and that thought upon his name,bible-kjv
4 3 and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that i shall do this saith the lord of hosts,bible-kjv
1 1 the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham,bible-kjv
1 20 but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost,bible-kjv
for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him,bible-kjv
2 8 and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that i may come and worship him also,bible-kjv
2 13 and when they were departed behold the angel of the lord appeareth to joseph in a dream saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into egypt and be thou there until i bring thee word for herod will seek the young child to destroy him,bible-kjv
2 21 and he arose and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of israel,bible-kjv
3 5 then went out to him jerusalem and all judaea and all the region round about jordan 3 6 and were baptized of him in jordan confessing their sins,bible-kjv
but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire 3 12 whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire,bible-kjv
3 16 and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him 3 17 and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased,bible-kjv
4 5 then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple 4 6 and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone,bible-kjv
4 12 now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee 4 13 and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zabulon and nephthalim 4 14 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying 4 15 the land of zabulon and the land of nephthalim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles 4 16 the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up,bible-kjv
4 21 and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james the son of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them,bible-kjv
5 1 and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him 5 2 and he opened his mouth and taught them saying 5 3 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven,bible-kjv
5 8 blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god,bible-kjv
5 13 ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be salted,bible-kjv
5 16 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven,bible-kjv
5 21 ye have heard that it was said of them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment 5 22 but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raca shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire,bible-kjv
5 29 and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell,bible-kjv
5 37 but let your communication be yea yea nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil,bible-kjv
5 43 ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy,bible-kjv
do not even the publicans so,bible-kjv
6 3 but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth 6 4 that thine alms may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly,bible-kjv
6 8 be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him,bible-kjv
6 13 and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever,bible-kjv
6 17 but thou when thou fastest anoint thine head and wash thy face 6 18 that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly,bible-kjv
6 24 no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other,bible-kjv
are ye not much better than they,bible-kjv
6 31 therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat,bible-kjv
6 34 take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself,bible-kjv
7 4 or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye,bible-kjv
7 10 or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent,bible-kjv
7 16 ye shall know them by their fruits,bible-kjv
7 20 wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them,bible-kjv
7 23 and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity,bible-kjv
8 2 and behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean,bible-kjv
8 7 and jesus saith unto him i will come and heal him,bible-kjv
8 12 but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,bible-kjv
8 16 when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick 8 17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses,bible-kjv
8 22 but jesus said unto him follow me and let the dead bury their dead,bible-kjv
then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm,bible-kjv
8 30 and there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding,bible-kjv
8 34 and behold the whole city came out to meet jesus and when they saw him they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts,bible-kjv
9 5 for whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk,bible-kjv
and he arose and followed him,bible-kjv
9 14 then came to him the disciples of john saying why do we and the pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not,bible-kjv
9 18 while he spake these things unto them behold there came a certain ruler and worshipped him saying my daughter is even now dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live,bible-kjv
9 23 and when jesus came into the ruler s house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise 9 24 he said unto them give place for the maid is not dead but sleepeth,bible-kjv
9 28 and when he was come into the house the blind men came to him and jesus saith unto them believe ye that i am able to do this,bible-kjv
9 32 as they went out behold they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil,bible-kjv
9 37 then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the labourers are few 9 38 pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth labourers into his harvest,bible-kjv
10 8 heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils freely ye have received freely give,bible-kjv
10 14 and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words when ye depart out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feet,bible-kjv
10 20 for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you,bible-kjv
10 25 it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant as his lord,bible-kjv
10 29 are not two sparrows sold for a farthing,bible-kjv
10 33 but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven,bible-kjv
10 38 and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me,bible-kjv
11 1 and it came to pass when jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities,bible-kjv
a reed shaken with the wind,bible-kjv
a prophet,bible-kjv
11 13 for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john,bible-kjv
11 18 for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he hath a devil,bible-kjv
for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes,bible-kjv
11 26 even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight,bible-kjv
12 1 at that time jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn and his disciples were an hungred and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat,bible-kjv
12 7 but if ye had known what this meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice ye would not have condemned the guiltless,bible-kjv
12 11 and he said unto them what man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day will he not lay hold on it and lift it out,bible-kjv
12 14 then the pharisees went out and held a council against him how they might destroy him,bible-kjv
12 22 then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil blind and dumb and he healed him insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw,bible-kjv
therefore they shall be your judges,bible-kjv
12 31 wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men,bible-kjv
12 35 a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things,bible-kjv
12 41 the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here,bible-kjv
even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation,bible-kjv
12 49 and he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples and said behold my mother and my brethren,bible-kjv
13 7 and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them 13 8 but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold,bible-kjv
13 13 therefore speak i to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand,bible-kjv
13 19 when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart,bible-kjv
13 24 another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field 13 25 but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way,bible-kjv
the servants said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up,bible-kjv
13 34 all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables and without a parable spake he not unto them 13 35 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world,bible-kjv
13 43 then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father,bible-kjv
13 49 so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just 13 50 and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth,bible-kjv
13 54 and when he was come into his own country he taught them in their synagogue insomuch that they were astonished and said whence hath this man this wisdom and these mighty works,bible-kjv
whence then hath this man all these things,bible-kjv
14 3 for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put him in prison for herodias sake his brother philip s wife,bible-kjv
14 8 and she being before instructed of her mother said give me here john baptist s head in a charger,bible-kjv
14 13 when jesus heard of it he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart and when the people had heard thereof they followed him on foot out of the cities,bible-kjv
14 18 he said bring them hither to me,bible-kjv
14 23 and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone,bible-kjv
14 28 and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water,bible-kjv
14 32 and when they were come into the ship the wind ceased,bible-kjv
for they wash not their hands when they eat bread,bible-kjv
15 7 ye hypocrites well did esaias prophesy of you saying 15 8 this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me,bible-kjv
15 14 let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind,bible-kjv
15 18 but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man,bible-kjv
and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us,bible-kjv
15 28 then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt,bible-kjv
15 33 and his disciples say unto him whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness as to fill so great a multitude,bible-kjv
15 37 and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full,bible-kjv
16 3 and in the morning it will be foul weather to day for the sky is red and lowering,bible-kjv
16 6 then jesus said unto them take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees,bible-kjv
16 11 how is it that ye do not understand that i spake it not to you concerning bread that ye should beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees,bible-kjv
16 16 and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god,bible-kjv
16 21 from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples how that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day,bible-kjv
16 26 for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul,bible-kjv
17 3 and behold there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with him,bible-kjv
17 8 and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save jesus only,bible-kjv
likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them,bible-kjv
how long shall i suffer you,bible-kjv
17 21 howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting,bible-kjv
and when he was come into the house jesus prevented him saying what thinkest thou simon,bible-kjv
17 27 notwithstanding lest we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money that take and give unto them for me and thee,bible-kjv
18 6 but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea,bible-kjv
18 10 take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven,bible-kjv
18 14 even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish,bible-kjv
18 19 again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven,bible-kjv
18 23 therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which would take account of his servants,bible-kjv
18 28 but the same servant went out and found one of his fellowservants which owed him an hundred pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest,bible-kjv
18 34 and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him,bible-kjv
19 6 wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh,bible-kjv
19 10 his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry,bible-kjv
19 14 but jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven,bible-kjv
19 18 he saith unto him which,bible-kjv
19 23 then said jesus unto his disciples verily i say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven,bible-kjv
19 28 and jesus said unto them verily i say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel,bible-kjv
20 3 and he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace 20 4 and said unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right i will give you,bible-kjv
he saith unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right that shall ye receive,bible-kjv
20 13 but he answered one of them and said friend i do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me for a penny,bible-kjv
20 17 and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way and said unto them 20 18 behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death 20 19 and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again,bible-kjv
are ye able to drink of the cup that i shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with,bible-kjv
20 26 but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister 20 27 and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant 20 28 even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many,bible-kjv
20 33 they say unto him lord that our eyes may be opened,bible-kjv
21 6 and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them 21 7 and brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes and they set him thereon,bible-kjv
21 12 and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves 21 13 and said unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves,bible-kjv
21 18 now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered,bible-kjv
21 22 and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive,bible-kjv
from heaven or of men,bible-kjv
21 28 but what think ye,bible-kjv
21 31 whether of them twain did the will of his father,bible-kjv
21 35 and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another,bible-kjv
21 40 when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto those husbandmen,bible-kjv
21 45 and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parables they perceived that he spake of them,bible-kjv
22 7 but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city,bible-kjv
and he was speechless,bible-kjv
22 17 tell us therefore what thinkest thou,bible-kjv
22 20 and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription,bible-kjv
22 25 now there were with us seven brethren and the first when he had married a wife deceased and having no issue left his wife unto his brother 22 26 likewise the second also and the third unto the seventh,bible-kjv
22 30 for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of god in heaven,bible-kjv
22 35 then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying 22 36 master which is the great commandment in the law,bible-kjv
22 41 while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them 22 42 saying what think ye of christ,bible-kjv
22 46 and no man was able to answer him a word neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions,bible-kjv
23 9 and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven,bible-kjv
for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in,bible-kjv
23 16 woe unto you ye blind guides which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor,bible-kjv
23 21 and whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein,bible-kjv
23 25 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites,bible-kjv
23 28 even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity,bible-kjv
23 33 ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell,bible-kjv
23 39 for i say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord,bible-kjv
and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world,bible-kjv
24 8 all these are the beginning of sorrows,bible-kjv
24 13 but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved,bible-kjv
24 22 and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elect s sake those days shall be shortened,bible-kjv
24 27 for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be,bible-kjv
24 34 verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled,bible-kjv
24 40 then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left,bible-kjv
24 45 who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season,bible-kjv
25 2 and five of them were wise and five were foolish,bible-kjv
25 8 and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out,bible-kjv
25 13 watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh,bible-kjv
25 18 but he that had received one went and digged in the earth and hid his lord s money,bible-kjv
25 23 his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord,bible-kjv
25 30 and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,bible-kjv
25 38 when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in,bible-kjv
25 44 then shall they also answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee,bible-kjv
26 5 but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar among the people,bible-kjv
for she hath wrought a good work upon me,bible-kjv
and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver,bible-kjv
26 20 now when the even was come he sat down with the twelve,bible-kjv
it had been good for that man if he had not been born,bible-kjv
26 29 but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my father s kingdom,bible-kjv
26 34 jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee that this night before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice,bible-kjv
26 38 then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me,bible-kjv
26 43 and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy,bible-kjv
26 48 now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same is he hold him fast,bible-kjv
26 52 then said jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword,bible-kjv
26 56 but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled,bible-kjv
at the last came two false witnesses 26 61 and said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days,bible-kjv
26 65 then the high priest rent his clothes saying he hath spoken blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses,bible-kjv
26 69 now peter sat without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou also wast with jesus of galilee,bible-kjv
26 74 then began he to curse and to swear saying i know not the man,bible-kjv
27 3 then judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders 27 4 saying i have sinned in that i have betrayed the innocent blood,bible-kjv
27 7 and they took counsel and bought with them the potter s field to bury strangers in,bible-kjv
27 12 and when he was accused of the chief priests and elders he answered nothing,bible-kjv
27 17 therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that i release unto you,bible-kjv
27 21 the governor answered and said unto them whether of the twain will ye that i release unto you,bible-kjv
but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified,bible-kjv
27 28 and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe,bible-kjv
27 33 and when they were come unto a place called golgotha that is to say a place of a skull 27 34 they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink,bible-kjv
if thou be the son of god come down from the cross,bible-kjv
27 45 now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour,bible-kjv
27 49 the rest said let be let us see whether elias will come to save him,bible-kjv
27 57 when the even was come there came a rich man of arimathaea named joseph who also himself was jesus disciple 27 58 he went to pilate and begged the body of jesus,bible-kjv
27 64 command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first,bible-kjv
28 3 his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow 28 4 and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men,bible-kjv
28 8 and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word,bible-kjv
28 12 and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers 28 13 saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept,bible-kjv
28 18 and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth,bible-kjv
1 3 the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight,bible-kjv
1 9 and it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized of john in jordan,bible-kjv
1 16 now as he walked by the sea of galilee he saw simon and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers,bible-kjv
1 21 and they went into capernaum and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught,bible-kjv
1 25 and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him,bible-kjv
1 28 and immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about galilee,bible-kjv
1 33 and all the city was gathered together at the door,bible-kjv
1 38 and he said unto them let us go into the next towns that i may preach there also for therefore came i forth,bible-kjv
1 43 and he straitly charged him and forthwith sent him away 1 44 and saith unto him see thou say nothing to any man but go thy way shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing those things which moses commanded for a testimony unto them,bible-kjv
2 4 and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press they uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken it up they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay,bible-kjv
2 9 whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and take up thy bed and walk,bible-kjv
and he arose and followed him,bible-kjv
2 19 and jesus said unto them can the children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them,bible-kjv
2 23 and it came to pass that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears of corn,bible-kjv
3 1 and he entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there which had a withered hand,bible-kjv
but they held their peace,bible-kjv
3 9 and he spake to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude lest they should throng him,bible-kjv
3 14 and he ordained twelve that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach 3 15 and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils 3 16 and simon he surnamed peter 3 17 and james the son of zebedee and john the brother of james and he surnamed them boanerges which is the sons of thunder 3 18 and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james the son of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the canaanite 3 19 and judas iscariot which also betrayed him and they went into an house,bible-kjv
3 24 and if a kingdom be divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand,bible-kjv
3 30 because they said he hath an unclean spirit,bible-kjv
3 35 for whosoever shall do the will of god the same is my brother and my sister and mother,bible-kjv
4 8 and other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth some thirty and some sixty and some an hundred,bible-kjv
and how then will ye know all parables,bible-kjv
4 20 and these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some sixty and some an hundred,bible-kjv
4 24 and he said unto them take heed what ye hear with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you and unto you that hear shall more be given,bible-kjv
4 30 and he said whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god,bible-kjv
4 35 and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side,bible-kjv
4 39 and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still,bible-kjv
5 1 and they came over unto the other side of the sea into the country of the gadarenes,bible-kjv
5 8 for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit,bible-kjv
5 12 and all the devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them,bible-kjv
5 15 and they come to jesus and see him that was possessed with the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid,bible-kjv
5 20 and he departed and began to publish in decapolis how great things jesus had done for him and all men did marvel,bible-kjv
5 28 for she said if i may touch but his clothes i shall be whole,bible-kjv
5 33 but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth,bible-kjv
5 38 and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and seeth the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly,bible-kjv
5 41 and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talitha cumi which is being interpreted damsel i say unto thee arise,bible-kjv
6 2 and when the sabbath day was come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying from whence hath this man these things,bible-kjv
6 4 but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honour but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house,bible-kjv
6 10 and he said unto them in what place soever ye enter into an house there abide till ye depart from that place,bible-kjv
6 14 and king herod heard of him for his name was spread abroad and he said that john the baptist was risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him,bible-kjv
6 18 for john had said unto herod it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother s wife,bible-kjv
and she said the head of john the baptist,bible-kjv
6 30 and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus and told him all things both what they had done and what they had taught,bible-kjv
6 35 and when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him and said this is a desert place and now the time is far passed 6 36 send them away that they may go into the country round about and into the villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to eat,bible-kjv
and when they knew they say five and two fishes,bible-kjv
6 43 and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes,bible-kjv
6 48 and he saw them toiling in rowing for the wind was contrary unto them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walking upon the sea and would have passed by them,bible-kjv
6 53 and when they had passed over they came into the land of gennesaret and drew to the shore,bible-kjv
7 3 for the pharisees and all the jews except they wash their hands oft eat not holding the tradition of the elders,bible-kjv
7 7 howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men,bible-kjv
7 14 and when he had called all the people unto him he said unto them hearken unto me every one of you and understand 7 15 there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him but the things which come out of him those are they that defile the man,bible-kjv
7 20 and he said that which cometh out of the man that defileth the man,bible-kjv
7 28 and she answered and said unto him yes lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the children s crumbs,bible-kjv
7 33 and he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers into his ears and he spit and touched his tongue 7 34 and looking up to heaven he sighed and saith unto him ephphatha that is be opened,bible-kjv
8 5 and he asked them how many loaves have ye,bible-kjv
8 9 and they that had eaten were about four thousand and he sent them away,bible-kjv
8 13 and he left them and entering into the ship again departed to the other side,bible-kjv
perceive ye not yet neither understand,bible-kjv
8 19 when i brake the five loaves among five thousand how many baskets full of fragments took ye up,bible-kjv
8 22 and he cometh to bethsaida and they bring a blind man unto him and besought him to touch him,bible-kjv
8 27 and jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of caesarea philippi and by the way he asked his disciples saying unto them whom do men say that i am,bible-kjv
8 31 and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again,bible-kjv
8 35 for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel s the same shall save it,bible-kjv
9 2 and after six days jesus taketh with him peter and james and john and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them,bible-kjv
9 7 and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him,bible-kjv
9 12 and he answered and told them elias verily cometh first and restoreth all things and how it is written of the son of man that he must suffer many things and be set at nought,bible-kjv
9 17 and one of the multitude answered and said master i have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit 9 18 and wheresoever he taketh him he teareth him and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth and pineth away and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not,bible-kjv
9 21 and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came unto him,bible-kjv
9 25 when jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit i charge thee come out of him and enter no more into him,bible-kjv
9 30 and they departed thence and passed through galilee and he would not that any man should know it,bible-kjv
9 35 and he sat down and called the twelve and saith unto them if any man desire to be first the same shall be last of all and servant of all,bible-kjv
9 41 for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because ye belong to christ verily i say unto you he shall not lose his reward,bible-kjv
9 49 for every one shall be salted with fire and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt,bible-kjv
tempting him,bible-kjv
10 7 for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife 10 8 and they twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more twain but one flesh,bible-kjv
10 13 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them,bible-kjv
10 18 and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good,bible-kjv
10 22 and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions,bible-kjv
10 26 and they were astonished out of measure saying among themselves who then can be saved,bible-kjv
10 32 and they were in the way going up to jerusalem and jesus went before them and they were amazed and as they followed they were afraid,bible-kjv
10 38 but jesus said unto them ye know not what ye ask can ye drink of the cup that i drink of,bible-kjv
10 42 but jesus called them to him and saith unto them ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise authority upon them,bible-kjv
10 48 and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me,bible-kjv
the blind man said unto him lord that i might receive my sight,bible-kjv
say ye that the lord hath need of him and straightway he will send him hither,bible-kjv
11 8 and many spread their garments in the way and others cut down branches off the trees and strawed them in the way,bible-kjv
and his disciples heard it,bible-kjv
11 19 and when even was come he went out of the city,bible-kjv
11 24 therefore i say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them,bible-kjv
11 29 and jesus answered and said unto them i will also ask of you one question and answer me and i will tell you by what authority i do these things,bible-kjv
11 33 and they answered and said unto jesus we cannot tell,bible-kjv
12 3 and they caught him and beat him and sent him away empty,bible-kjv
12 8 and they took him and killed him and cast him out of the vineyard,bible-kjv
12 13 and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians to catch him in his words,bible-kjv
12 16 and they brought it,bible-kjv
12 18 then come unto him the sadducees which say there is no resurrection and they asked him saying 12 19 master moses wrote unto us if a man s brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother,bible-kjv
for the seven had her to wife,bible-kjv
12 28 and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all,bible-kjv
12 34 and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto him thou art not far from the kingdom of god,bible-kjv
and the common people heard him gladly,bible-kjv
13 1 and as he went out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto him master see what manner of stones and what buildings are here,bible-kjv
13 5 and jesus answering them began to say take heed lest any man deceive you 13 6 for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many,bible-kjv
13 11 but when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak neither do ye premeditate but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak ye for it is not ye that speak but the holy ghost,bible-kjv
13 18 and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter,bible-kjv
13 24 but in those days after that tribulation the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light 13 25 and the stars of heaven shall fall and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken,bible-kjv
13 31 heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away,bible-kjv
13 37 and what i say unto you i say unto all watch,bible-kjv
14 5 for it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and have been given to the poor,bible-kjv
14 8 she hath done what she could she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying,bible-kjv
14 12 and the first day of unleavened bread when they killed the passover his disciples said unto him where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover,bible-kjv
14 17 and in the evening he cometh with the twelve,bible-kjv
14 21 the son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed,bible-kjv
14 25 verily i say unto you i will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god,bible-kjv
14 30 and jesus saith unto him verily i say unto thee that this day even in this night before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice,bible-kjv
14 35 and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him,bible-kjv
the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is weak,bible-kjv
14 43 and immediately while he yet spake cometh judas one of the twelve and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders,bible-kjv
14 48 and jesus answered and said unto them are ye come out as against a thief with swords and with staves to take me,bible-kjv
14 54 and peter followed him afar off even into the palace of the high priest and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire,bible-kjv
14 60 and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked jesus saying answerest thou nothing,bible-kjv
14 63 then the high priest rent his clothes and saith what need we any further witnesses,bible-kjv
14 68 but he denied saying i know not neither understand i what thou sayest,bible-kjv
14 71 but he began to curse and to swear saying i know not this man of whom ye speak,bible-kjv
15 2 and pilate asked him art thou the king of the jews,bible-kjv
15 5 but jesus yet answered nothing so that pilate marvelled,bible-kjv
15 10 for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy,bible-kjv
and they cried out the more exceedingly crucify him,bible-kjv
15 20 and when they had mocked him they took off the purple from him and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him,bible-kjv
15 25 and it was the third hour and they crucified him,bible-kjv
15 31 likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes he saved others himself he cannot save,bible-kjv
which is being interpreted my god my god why hast thou forsaken me,bible-kjv
15 39 and when the centurion which stood over against him saw that he so cried out and gave up the ghost he said truly this man was the son of god,bible-kjv
15 46 and he bought fine linen and took him down and wrapped him in the linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre,bible-kjv
16 4 and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great,bible-kjv
16 9 now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils,bible-kjv
16 14 afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen,bible-kjv
16 20 and they went forth and preached every where the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following,bible-kjv
1 6 and they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless,bible-kjv
1 12 and when zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him,bible-kjv
1 17 and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord,bible-kjv
1 21 and the people waited for zacharias and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple,bible-kjv
1 28 and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that art highly favoured the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women,bible-kjv
1 34 then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man,bible-kjv
and the angel departed from her,bible-kjv
1 45 and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord,bible-kjv
1 51 he hath shewed strength with his arm he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts,bible-kjv
1 57 now elisabeth s full time came that she should be delivered and she brought forth a son,bible-kjv
1 62 and they made signs to his father how he would have him called,bible-kjv
1 66 and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts saying what manner of child shall this be,bible-kjv
2 1 and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed,bible-kjv
2 7 and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn,bible-kjv
2 12 and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger,bible-kjv
2 18 and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds,bible-kjv
2 25 and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him,bible-kjv
2 36 and there was one anna a prophetess the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of aser she was of a great age and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity 2 37 and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day,bible-kjv
2 42 and when he was twelve years old they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast,bible-kjv
2 47 and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers,bible-kjv
2 50 and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them,bible-kjv
3 5 every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways shall be made smooth 3 6 and all flesh shall see the salvation of god,bible-kjv
3 11 he answereth and saith unto them he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none and he that hath meat let him do likewise,bible-kjv
3 15 and as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their hearts of john whether he were the christ or not 3 16 john answered saying unto them all i indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than i cometh the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire 3 17 whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and will gather the wheat into his garner but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable,bible-kjv
4 1 and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness 4 2 being forty days tempted of the devil,bible-kjv
4 6 and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will i give it,bible-kjv
4 13 and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season,bible-kjv
and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written 4 18 the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised 4 19 to preach the acceptable year of the lord,bible-kjv
and they said is not this joseph s son,bible-kjv
4 28 and all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath 4 29 and rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built that they might cast him down headlong,bible-kjv
i know thee who thou art the holy one of god,bible-kjv
4 37 and the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about,bible-kjv
4 41 and devils also came out of many crying out and saying thou art christ the son of god,bible-kjv
5 1 and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of god he stood by the lake of gennesaret 5 2 and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets,bible-kjv
5 6 and when they had this done they inclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net brake,bible-kjv
and jesus said unto simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men,bible-kjv
5 14 and he charged him to tell no man but go and shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as moses commanded for a testimony unto them,bible-kjv
5 19 and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went upon the housetop and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before jesus,bible-kjv
5 23 whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk,bible-kjv
5 28 and he left all rose up and followed him,bible-kjv
5 33 and they said unto him why do the disciples of john fast often and make prayers and likewise the disciples of the pharisees but thine eat and drink,bible-kjv
5 38 but new wine must be put into new bottles and both are preserved,bible-kjv
6 5 and he said unto them that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath,bible-kjv
6 9 then said jesus unto them i will ask you one thing is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good or to do evil,bible-kjv
6 12 and it came to pass in those days that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to god,bible-kjv
6 21 blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled,bible-kjv
for ye have received your consolation,bible-kjv
6 26 woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you,bible-kjv
6 31 and as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise,bible-kjv
6 34 and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what thank have ye,bible-kjv
for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again,bible-kjv
6 42 either how canst thou say to thy brother brother let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye,bible-kjv
6 45 a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh,bible-kjv
7 2 and a certain centurion s servant who was dear unto him was sick and ready to die,bible-kjv
7 8 for i also am a man set under authority having under me soldiers and i say unto one go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it,bible-kjv
7 13 and when the lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weep not,bible-kjv
7 16 and there came a fear on all and they glorified god saying that a great prophet is risen up among us and that god hath visited his people,bible-kjv
7 20 when the men were come unto him they said john baptist hath sent us unto thee saying art thou he that should come,bible-kjv
7 24 and when the messengers of john were departed he began to speak unto the people concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness for to see,bible-kjv
7 26 but what went ye out for to see,bible-kjv
7 29 and all the people that heard him and the publicans justified god being baptized with the baptism of john,bible-kjv
7 33 for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and ye say he hath a devil,bible-kjv
7 37 and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisee s house brought an alabaster box of ointment 7 38 and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment,bible-kjv
7 42 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both,bible-kjv
i entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head,bible-kjv
7 49 and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also,bible-kjv
8 7 and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it,bible-kjv
8 11 now the parable is this the seed is the word of god,bible-kjv
8 16 no man when he hath lighted a candle covereth it with a vessel or putteth it under a bed but setteth it on a candlestick that they which enter in may see the light,bible-kjv
8 21 and he answered and said unto them my mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of god and do it,bible-kjv
then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased and there was a calm,bible-kjv
8 27 and when he went forth to land there met him out of the city a certain man which had devils long time and ware no clothes neither abode in any house but in the tombs,bible-kjv
8 30 and jesus asked him saying what is thy name,bible-kjv
8 33 then went the devils out of the man and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were choked,bible-kjv
8 38 now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him but jesus sent him away saying 8 39 return to thine own house and shew how great things god hath done unto thee,bible-kjv
8 43 and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years which had spent all her living upon physicians neither could be healed of any 8 44 came behind him and touched the border of his garment and immediately her issue of blood stanched,bible-kjv
8 48 and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace,bible-kjv
8 53 and they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead,bible-kjv
9 2 and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick,bible-kjv
9 7 now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him and he was perplexed because that it was said of some that john was risen from the dead 9 8 and of some that elias had appeared and of others that one of the old prophets was risen again,bible-kjv
9 11 and the people when they knew it followed him and he received them and spake unto them of the kingdom of god and healed them that had need of healing,bible-kjv
and he said to his disciples make them sit down by fifties in a company,bible-kjv
9 19 they answering said john the baptist but some say elias and others say that one of the old prophets is risen again,bible-kjv
9 24 for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it,bible-kjv
9 29 and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistering,bible-kjv
9 35 and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him,bible-kjv
9 39 and lo a spirit taketh him and he suddenly crieth out and it teareth him that he foameth again and bruising him hardly departeth from him,bible-kjv
and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and delivered him again to his father,bible-kjv
9 47 and jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and set him by him 9 48 and said unto them whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great,bible-kjv
9 54 and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as elias did,bible-kjv
9 58 and jesus said unto him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head,bible-kjv
9 62 and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god,bible-kjv
10 5 and into whatsoever house ye enter first say peace be to this house,bible-kjv
10 10 but into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not go your ways out into the streets of the same and say 10 11 even the very dust of your city which cleaveth on us we do wipe off against you notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you,bible-kjv
10 14 but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the judgment than for you,bible-kjv
10 19 behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you,bible-kjv
10 25 and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life,bible-kjv
10 29 but he willing to justify himself said unto jesus and who is my neighbour,bible-kjv
10 35 and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when i come again i will repay thee,bible-kjv
10 39 and she had a sister called mary which also sat at jesus feet and heard his word,bible-kjv
11 2 and he said unto them when ye pray say our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name,bible-kjv
and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil,bible-kjv
11 10 for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened,bible-kjv
11 14 and he was casting out a devil and it was dumb,bible-kjv
11 18 if satan also be divided against himself how shall his kingdom stand,bible-kjv
11 21 when a strong man armed keepeth his palace his goods are in peace 11 22 but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted and divideth his spoils,bible-kjv
11 27 and it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is the womb that bare thee and the paps which thou hast sucked,bible-kjv
11 32 the men of nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here,bible-kjv
11 37 and as he spake a certain pharisee besought him to dine with him and he went in and sat down to meat,bible-kjv
11 42 but woe unto you pharisees,bible-kjv
for ye are as graves which appear not and the men that walk over them are not aware of them,bible-kjv
for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and your fathers killed them,bible-kjv
11 53 and as he said these things unto them the scribes and the pharisees began to urge him vehemently and to provoke him to speak of many things 11 54 laying wait for him and seeking to catch something out of his mouth that they might accuse him,bible-kjv
12 5 but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fear him,bible-kjv
12 10 and whosoever shall speak a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but unto him that blasphemeth against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven,bible-kjv
12 16 and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully 12 17 and he thought within himself saying what shall i do because i have no room where to bestow my fruits,bible-kjv
12 22 and he said unto his disciples therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat neither for the body what ye shall put on,bible-kjv
12 27 consider the lilies how they grow they toil not they spin not and yet i say unto you that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these,bible-kjv
12 32 fear not little flock for it is your father s good pleasure to give you the kingdom,bible-kjv
12 38 and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so blessed are those servants,bible-kjv
12 43 blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing,bible-kjv
for unto whomsoever much is given of him shall be much required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the more,bible-kjv
12 53 the father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother the mother in law against her daughter in law and the daughter in law against her mother in law,bible-kjv
12 58 when thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate as thou art in the way give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him lest he hale thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and the officer cast thee into prison,bible-kjv
13 4 or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slew them think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem,bible-kjv
13 10 and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath,bible-kjv
13 15 the lord then answered him and said thou hypocrite doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering,bible-kjv
13 19 it is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew and waxed a great tree and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it,bible-kjv
and he said unto them 13 24 strive to enter in at the strait gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able,bible-kjv
13 30 and behold there are last which shall be first and there are first which shall be last,bible-kjv
13 35 behold your house is left unto you desolate and verily i say unto you ye shall not see me until the time come when ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord,bible-kjv
and he took him and healed him and let him go 14 5 and answered them saying which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day,bible-kjv
14 11 for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted,bible-kjv
14 18 and they all with one consent began to make excuse,bible-kjv
then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind,bible-kjv
14 27 and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple,bible-kjv
14 33 so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple,bible-kjv
15 2 and the pharisees and scribes murmured saying this man receiveth sinners and eateth with them,bible-kjv
15 8 either what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it,bible-kjv
15 13 and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living,bible-kjv
15 18 i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee 15 19 and am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants,bible-kjv
and they began to be merry,bible-kjv
15 29 and he answering said to his father lo these many years do i serve thee neither transgressed i at any time thy commandment and yet thou never gavest me a kid that i might make merry with my friends 15 30 but as soon as this thy son was come which hath devoured thy living with harlots thou hast killed for him the fatted calf,bible-kjv
give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no longer steward,bible-kjv
16 6 and he said an hundred measures of oil,bible-kjv
16 8 and the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done wisely for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light,bible-kjv
16 13 no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other,bible-kjv
16 17 and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fail,bible-kjv
16 25 but abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things and likewise lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented,bible-kjv
16 31 and he said unto him if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead,bible-kjv
17 5 and the apostles said unto the lord increase our faith,bible-kjv
i trow not,bible-kjv
and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed,bible-kjv
17 19 and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole,bible-kjv
17 23 and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them,bible-kjv
17 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded 17 29 but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all,bible-kjv
17 34 i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left,bible-kjv
18 1 and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint 18 2 saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man 18 3 and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary,bible-kjv
nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth,bible-kjv
18 14 i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted,bible-kjv
18 19 and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good,bible-kjv
18 23 and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich,bible-kjv
18 28 then peter said lo we have left all and followed thee,bible-kjv
18 35 and it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the way side begging 18 36 and hearing the multitude pass by he asked what it meant,bible-kjv
and he said lord that i may receive my sight,bible-kjv
19 3 and he sought to see jesus who he was and could not for the press because he was little of stature,bible-kjv
19 8 and zacchaeus stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken any thing from any man by false accusation i restore him fourfold,bible-kjv
19 13 and he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds and said unto them occupy till i come,bible-kjv
19 18 and the second came saying lord thy pound hath gained five pounds,bible-kjv
19 24 and he said unto them that stood by take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten pounds,bible-kjv
19 29 and it came to pass when he was come nigh to bethphage and bethany at the mount called the mount of olives he sent two of his disciples 19 30 saying go ye into the village over against you in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied whereon yet never man sat loose him and bring him hither,bible-kjv
19 34 and they said the lord hath need of him,bible-kjv
19 40 and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out,bible-kjv
19 47 and he taught daily in the temple,bible-kjv
20 5 and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why then believed ye him not,bible-kjv
20 10 and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty,bible-kjv
20 14 but when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned among themselves saying this is the heir come let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours,bible-kjv
20 17 and he beheld them and said what is this then that is written the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner,bible-kjv
20 23 but he perceived their craftiness and said unto them why tempt ye me,bible-kjv
20 26 and they could not take hold of his words before the people and they marvelled at his answer and held their peace,bible-kjv
20 32 last of all the woman died also,bible-kjv
20 38 for he is not a god of the dead but of the living for all live unto him,bible-kjv
20 44 david therefore calleth him lord how is he then his son,bible-kjv
21 5 and as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts he said 21 6 as for these things which ye behold the days will come in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down,bible-kjv
21 10 then said he unto them nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom 21 11 and great earthquakes shall be in divers places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven,bible-kjv
21 17 and ye shall be hated of all men for my name s sake,bible-kjv
21 22 for these be the days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled,bible-kjv
21 27 and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory,bible-kjv
21 33 heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away,bible-kjv
21 38 and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple for to hear him,bible-kjv
22 5 and they were glad and covenanted to give him money,bible-kjv
22 10 and he said unto them behold when ye are entered into the city there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water follow him into the house where he entereth in,bible-kjv
22 15 and he said unto them with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer 22 16 for i say unto you i will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god,bible-kjv
22 22 and truly the son of man goeth as it was determined but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed,bible-kjv
22 27 for whether is greater he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth,bible-kjv
22 31 and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat 22 32 but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren,bible-kjv
22 36 then said he unto them but now he that hath a purse let him take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one,bible-kjv
22 40 and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation,bible-kjv
rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation,bible-kjv
22 51 and jesus answered and said suffer ye thus far,bible-kjv
and peter followed afar off,bible-kjv
and peter said man i am not,bible-kjv
and peter remembered the word of the lord how he had said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice,bible-kjv
22 66 and as soon as it was day the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together and led him into their council saying 22 67 art thou the christ,bible-kjv
and he said unto them ye say that i am,bible-kjv
23 3 and pilate asked him saying art thou the king of the jews,bible-kjv
23 7 and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herod s jurisdiction he sent him to herod who himself also was at jerusalem at that time,bible-kjv
23 12 and the same day pilate and herod were made friends together for before they were at enmity between themselves,bible-kjv
23 20 pilate therefore willing to release jesus spake again to them,bible-kjv
and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed,bible-kjv
23 28 but jesus turning unto them said daughters of jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children,bible-kjv
23 33 and when they were come to the place which is called calvary there they crucified him and the malefactors one on the right hand and the other on the left,bible-kjv
23 36 and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar 23 37 and saying if thou be the king of the jews save thyself,bible-kjv
23 42 and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom,bible-kjv
23 47 now when the centurion saw what was done he glorified god saying certainly this was a righteous man,bible-kjv
23 53 and he took it down and wrapped it in linen and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone wherein never man before was laid,bible-kjv
24 2 and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre,bible-kjv
24 10 it was mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and other women that were with them which told these things unto the apostles,bible-kjv
24 15 and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them,bible-kjv
and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people 24 20 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him,bible-kjv
24 27 and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself,bible-kjv
24 31 and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight,bible-kjv
24 37 but they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit,bible-kjv
24 41 and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye here any meat,bible-kjv
24 48 and ye are witnesses of these things,bible-kjv
amen,bible-kjv
1 4 in him was life and the life was the light of men,bible-kjv
1 9 that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,bible-kjv
1 15 john bare witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom i spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me,bible-kjv
1 20 and he confessed and denied not but confessed i am not the christ,bible-kjv
and he answered no,bible-kjv
1 24 and they which were sent were of the pharisees,bible-kjv
1 30 this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me,bible-kjv
1 35 again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples 1 36 and looking upon jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of god,bible-kjv
they came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour,bible-kjv
1 43 the day following jesus would go forth into galilee and findeth philip and saith unto him follow me,bible-kjv
1 47 jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith of him behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile,bible-kjv
thou shalt see greater things than these,bible-kjv
mine hour is not yet come,bible-kjv
2 8 and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast,bible-kjv
2 13 and the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem,bible-kjv
2 20 then said the jews forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days,bible-kjv
3 1 there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews 3 2 the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him,bible-kjv
3 6 that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit,bible-kjv
3 11 verily verily i say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witness,bible-kjv
3 17 for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved,bible-kjv
3 22 after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea and there he tarried with them and baptized,bible-kjv
3 27 john answered and said a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven,bible-kjv
3 32 and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man receiveth his testimony,bible-kjv
4 1 when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john 4 2 though jesus himself baptized not but his disciples 4 3 he left judaea and departed again into galilee,bible-kjv
4 7 there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink,bible-kjv
4 11 the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water,bible-kjv
4 17 the woman answered and said i have no husband,bible-kjv
4 22 ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews,bible-kjv
4 27 and upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou,bible-kjv
4 32 but he said unto them i have meat to eat that ye know not of,bible-kjv
4 36 and he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together,bible-kjv
4 41 and many more believed because of his own word 4 42 and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the saviour of the world,bible-kjv
and there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at capernaum,bible-kjv
and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way,bible-kjv
4 54 this is again the second miracle that jesus did when he was come out of judaea into galilee,bible-kjv
5 5 and a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight years,bible-kjv
5 10 the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed,bible-kjv
5 15 the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had made him whole,bible-kjv
5 20 for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all things that himself doeth and he will shew him greater works than these that ye may marvel,bible-kjv
5 25 verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live,bible-kjv
5 32 there is another that beareth witness of me and i know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true,bible-kjv
5 37 and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me,bible-kjv
5 41 i receive not honour from men,bible-kjv
5 46 for had ye believed moses ye would have believed me for he wrote of me,bible-kjv
6 4 and the passover a feast of the jews was nigh,bible-kjv
6 10 and jesus said make the men sit down,bible-kjv
6 13 therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten,bible-kjv
6 18 and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew,bible-kjv
6 25 and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when camest thou hither,bible-kjv
6 30 they said therefore unto him what sign shewest thou then that we may see and believe thee,bible-kjv
6 34 then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread,bible-kjv
6 39 and this is the father s will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day,bible-kjv
6 43 jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves,bible-kjv
6 47 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life,bible-kjv
6 52 the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat,bible-kjv
6 57 as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me,bible-kjv
6 62 what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before,bible-kjv
6 66 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him,bible-kjv
6 70 jesus answered them have not i chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil,bible-kjv
7 4 for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly,bible-kjv
7 8 go ye up unto this feast i go not up yet unto this feast for my time is not yet full come,bible-kjv
7 13 howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews,bible-kjv
7 18 he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him,bible-kjv
7 22 moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is of moses but of the fathers and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man,bible-kjv
do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ,bible-kjv
7 31 and many of the people believed on him and said when christ cometh will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done,bible-kjv
will he go unto the dispersed among the gentiles and teach the gentiles,bible-kjv
7 40 many of the people therefore when they heard this saying said of a truth this is the prophet,bible-kjv
7 44 and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on him,bible-kjv
7 49 but this people who knoweth not the law are cursed,bible-kjv
8 1 jesus went unto the mount of olives,bible-kjv
but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not,bible-kjv
hath no man condemned thee,bible-kjv
8 14 jesus answered and said unto them though i bear record of myself yet my record is true for i know whence i came and whither i go but ye cannot tell whence i come and whither i go,bible-kjv
8 19 then said they unto him where is thy father,bible-kjv
because he saith whither i go ye cannot come,bible-kjv
8 26 i have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him,bible-kjv
8 31 then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed 8 32 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free,bible-kjv
8 37 i know that ye are abraham s seed but ye seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you,bible-kjv
8 41 ye do the deeds of your father,bible-kjv
8 44 ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do,bible-kjv
and if i say the truth why do ye not believe me,bible-kjv
8 51 verily verily i say unto you if a man keep my saying he shall never see death,bible-kjv
8 54 jesus answered if i honour myself my honour is nothing it is my father that honoureth me of whom ye say that he is your god 8 55 yet ye have not known him but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be a liar like unto you but i know him and keep his saying,bible-kjv
9 1 and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth,bible-kjv
9 6 when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay 9 7 and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which is by interpretation sent,bible-kjv
9 11 he answered and said a man that is called jesus made clay and anointed mine eyes and said unto me go to the pool of siloam and wash and i went and washed and i received sight,bible-kjv
9 15 then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight,bible-kjv
9 17 they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that he hath opened thine eyes,bible-kjv
9 20 his parents answered them and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind 9 21 but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself,bible-kjv
9 26 then said they to him again what did he to thee,bible-kjv
9 29 we know that god spake unto moses as for this fellow we know not from whence he is,bible-kjv
9 34 they answered and said unto him thou wast altogether born in sins and dost thou teach us,bible-kjv
9 38 and he said lord i believe,bible-kjv
10 1 verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber,bible-kjv
10 6 this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them,bible-kjv
10 11 i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep,bible-kjv
10 16 and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd,bible-kjv
10 19 there was a division therefore again among the jews for these sayings,bible-kjv
10 23 and jesus walked in the temple in solomon s porch,bible-kjv
10 27 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me 10 28 and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand,bible-kjv
10 33 the jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself god,bible-kjv
10 39 therefore they sought again to take him but he escaped out of their hand 10 40 and went away again beyond jordan into the place where john at first baptized and there he abode,bible-kjv
11 3 therefore his sisters sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick,bible-kjv
11 8 his disciples say unto him master the jews of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither again,bible-kjv
11 12 then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well,bible-kjv
11 17 then when jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave four days already,bible-kjv
11 23 jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again,bible-kjv
11 28 and when she had so said she went her way and called mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and calleth for thee,bible-kjv
11 33 when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled,bible-kjv
11 37 and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died,bible-kjv
11 40 jesus saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of god,bible-kjv
11 44 and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin,bible-kjv
for this man doeth many miracles,bible-kjv
11 54 jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness into a city called ephraim and there continued with his disciples,bible-kjv
12 2 there they made him a supper and martha served but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him,bible-kjv
12 8 for the poor always ye have with you but me ye have not always,bible-kjv
12 16 these things understood not his disciples at the first but when jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were written of him and that they had done these things unto him,bible-kjv
12 20 and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast 12 21 the same came therefore to philip which was of bethsaida of galilee and desired him saying sir we would see jesus,bible-kjv
12 26 if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honour,bible-kjv
12 29 the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him,bible-kjv
12 34 the people answered him we have heard out of the law that christ abideth for ever and how sayest thou the son of man must be lifted up,bible-kjv
these things spake jesus and departed and did hide himself from them,bible-kjv
12 42 nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him but because of the pharisees they did not confess him lest they should be put out of the synagogue 12 43 for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of god,bible-kjv
12 48 he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day,bible-kjv
13 5 after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded,bible-kjv
13 9 simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head,bible-kjv
13 14 if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another s feet,bible-kjv
13 19 now i tell you before it come that when it is come to pass ye may believe that i am he,bible-kjv
13 24 simon peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake,bible-kjv
then said jesus unto him that thou doest do quickly,bible-kjv
13 32 if god be glorified in him god shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him,bible-kjv
13 36 simon peter said unto him lord whither goest thou,bible-kjv
verily verily i say unto thee the cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice,bible-kjv
14 4 and whither i go ye know and the way ye know,bible-kjv
14 9 jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip,bible-kjv
14 12 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father,bible-kjv
14 18 i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you,bible-kjv
14 23 jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him,bible-kjv
let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid,bible-kjv
14 31 but that the world may know that i love the father and as the father gave me commandment even so i do,bible-kjv
15 4 abide in me and i in you,bible-kjv
15 8 herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples,bible-kjv
15 13 greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends,bible-kjv
15 18 if the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated you,bible-kjv
15 22 if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin,bible-kjv
16 1 these things have i spoken unto you that ye should not be offended,bible-kjv
16 5 but now i go my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh me whither goest thou,bible-kjv
16 13 howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will shew you things to come,bible-kjv
16 18 they said therefore what is this that he saith a little while,bible-kjv
16 22 and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you,bible-kjv
16 26 at that day ye shall ask in my name and i say not unto you that i will pray the father for you 16 27 for the father himself loveth you because ye have loved me and have believed that i came out from god,bible-kjv
16 32 behold the hour cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet i am not alone because the father is with me,bible-kjv
17 4 i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do,bible-kjv
17 9 i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me for they are thine,bible-kjv
17 13 and now come i to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves,bible-kjv
17 18 as thou hast sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world,bible-kjv
17 25 o righteous father the world hath not known thee but i have known thee and these have known that thou hast sent me,bible-kjv
18 4 jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him went forth and said unto them whom seek ye,bible-kjv
18 7 then asked he them again whom seek ye,bible-kjv
18 11 then said jesus unto peter put up thy sword into the sheath the cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink it,bible-kjv
then went out that other disciple which was known unto the high priest and spake unto her that kept the door and brought in peter,bible-kjv
18 20 jesus answered him i spake openly to the world i ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither the jews always resort and in secret have i said nothing,bible-kjv
18 24 now annas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest,bible-kjv
18 27 peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew,bible-kjv
the jews therefore said unto him it is not lawful for us to put any man to death 18 32 that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should die,bible-kjv
18 36 jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence,bible-kjv
18 38 pilate saith unto him what is truth,bible-kjv
19 1 then pilate therefore took jesus and scourged him,bible-kjv
and pilate saith unto them behold the man,bible-kjv
but jesus gave him no answer,bible-kjv
19 13 when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement but in the hebrew gabbatha,bible-kjv
19 16 then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified,bible-kjv
19 20 this title then read many of the jews for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in hebrew and greek and latin,bible-kjv
these things therefore the soldiers did,bible-kjv
19 28 after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst,bible-kjv
19 33 but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legs 19 34 but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water,bible-kjv
he came therefore and took the body of jesus,bible-kjv
20 1 the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre,bible-kjv
20 6 then cometh simon peter following him and went into the sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie 20 7 and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself,bible-kjv
20 13 and they say unto her woman why weepest thou,bible-kjv
she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and i will take him away,bible-kjv
20 19 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you,bible-kjv
20 24 but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came,bible-kjv
20 28 and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god,bible-kjv
21 3 simon peter saith unto them i go a fishing,bible-kjv
they answered him no,bible-kjv
21 8 and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were two hundred cubits dragging the net with fishes,bible-kjv
and none of the disciples durst ask him who art thou,bible-kjv
he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee,bible-kjv
21 17 he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovest thou me,bible-kjv
21 19 this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify god,bible-kjv
follow thou me,bible-kjv
the acts of the apostles,bible-kjv
1 8 but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judaea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth,bible-kjv
1 13 and when they were come in they went up into an upper room where abode both peter and james and john and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james the son of alphaeus and simon zelotes and judas the brother of james,bible-kjv
1 19 and it was known unto all the dwellers at jerusalem insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue aceldama that is to say the field of blood,bible-kjv
1 26 and they gave forth their lots and the lot fell upon matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles,bible-kjv
2 5 and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven,bible-kjv
2 12 and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this,bible-kjv
2 25 for david speaketh concerning him i foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that i should not be moved 2 26 therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope 2 27 because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption,bible-kjv
2 33 therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear,bible-kjv
2 39 for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call,bible-kjv
2 44 and all that believed were together and had all things common 2 45 and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need,bible-kjv
3 4 and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us,bible-kjv
3 9 and all the people saw him walking and praising god 3 10 and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him,bible-kjv
3 14 but ye denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you 3 15 and killed the prince of life whom god hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses,bible-kjv
3 20 and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you 3 21 whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began,bible-kjv
3 26 unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities,bible-kjv
4 7 and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have ye done this,bible-kjv
4 14 and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it,bible-kjv
4 19 but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye,bible-kjv
4 24 and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou art god which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is 4 25 who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things,bible-kjv
4 32 and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common,bible-kjv
5 3 but peter said ananias why hath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land,bible-kjv
5 5 and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things,bible-kjv
5 9 then peter said unto her how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord,bible-kjv
5 13 and of the rest durst no man join himself to them but the people magnified them,bible-kjv
5 19 but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said 5 20 go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life,bible-kjv
5 25 then came one and told them saying behold the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people,bible-kjv
5 30 the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree,bible-kjv
5 36 for before these days rose up theudas boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to nought,bible-kjv
5 42 and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ,bible-kjv
6 5 and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose stephen a man full of faith and of the holy ghost and philip and prochorus and nicanor and timon and parmenas and nicolas a proselyte of antioch 6 6 whom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed they laid their hands on them,bible-kjv
6 11 then they suborned men which said we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and against god,bible-kjv
7 4 then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans and dwelt in charran and from thence when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell,bible-kjv
7 9 and the patriarchs moved with envy sold joseph into egypt but god was with him 7 10 and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt and he made him governor over egypt and all his house,bible-kjv
7 15 so jacob went down into egypt and died he and our fathers 7 16 and were carried over into sychem and laid in the sepulchre that abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of emmor the father of sychem,bible-kjv
7 23 and when he was full forty years old it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel,bible-kjv
7 29 then fled moses at this saying and was a stranger in the land of madian where he begat two sons,bible-kjv
7 34 i have seen i have seen the affliction of my people which is in egypt and i have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them,bible-kjv
7 37 this is that moses which said unto the children of israel a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear,bible-kjv
7 44 our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen,bible-kjv
7 50 hath not my hand made all these things,bible-kjv
7 55 but he being full of the holy ghost looked up stedfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god 7 56 and said behold i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of god,bible-kjv
8 1 and saul was consenting unto his death,bible-kjv
8 5 then philip went down to the city of samaria and preached christ unto them,bible-kjv
8 11 and to him they had regard because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries,bible-kjv
8 18 and when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles hands the holy ghost was given he offered them money 8 19 saying give me also this power that on whomsoever i lay hands he may receive the holy ghost,bible-kjv
8 24 then answered simon and said pray ye to the lord for me that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me,bible-kjv
8 30 and philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet esaias and said understandest thou what thou readest,bible-kjv
8 34 and the eunuch answered philip and said i pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet this,bible-kjv
and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god,bible-kjv
9 3 and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven 9 4 and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutest thou me,bible-kjv
9 7 and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man,bible-kjv
9 11 and the lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and enquire in the house of judas for one called saul of tarsus for behold he prayeth 9 12 and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight,bible-kjv
9 19 and when he had received meat he was strengthened,bible-kjv
9 23 and after that many days were fulfilled the jews took counsel to kill him 9 24 but their laying await was known of saul,bible-kjv
9 28 and he was with them coming in and going out at jerusalem,bible-kjv
9 33 and there he found a certain man named aeneas which had kept his bed eight years and was sick of the palsy,bible-kjv
9 37 and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber,bible-kjv
and she opened her eyes and when she saw peter she sat up,bible-kjv
10 3 he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of god coming in to him and saying unto him cornelius,bible-kjv
10 9 on the morrow as they went on their journey and drew nigh unto the city peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour 10 10 and he became very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance 10 11 and saw heaven opened and a certain vessel descending upon him as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners and let down to the earth 10 12 wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air,bible-kjv
10 17 now while peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean behold the men which were sent from cornelius had made enquiry for simon s house and stood before the gate 10 18 and called and asked whether simon which was surnamed peter were lodged there,bible-kjv
10 23 then called he them in and lodged them,bible-kjv
10 26 but peter took him up saying stand up i myself also am a man,bible-kjv
10 32 send therefore to joppa and call hither simon whose surname is peter he is lodged in the house of one simon a tanner by the sea side who when he cometh shall speak unto thee,bible-kjv
10 39 and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree 10 40 him god raised up the third day and shewed him openly 10 41 not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before god even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead,bible-kjv
10 46 for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god,bible-kjv
11 2 and when peter was come up to jerusalem they that were of the circumcision contended with him 11 3 saying thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and didst eat with them,bible-kjv
11 10 and this was done three times and all were drawn up again into heaven,bible-kjv
11 16 then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said john indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost,bible-kjv
11 21 and the hand of the lord was with them and a great number believed and turned unto the lord,bible-kjv
and it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people,bible-kjv
12 1 now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church,bible-kjv
12 5 peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him,bible-kjv
and so he did,bible-kjv
12 12 and when he had considered the thing he came to the house of mary the mother of john whose surname was mark where many were gathered together praying,bible-kjv
then said they it is his angel,bible-kjv
12 18 now as soon as it was day there was no small stir among the soldiers what was become of peter,bible-kjv
12 22 and the people gave a shout saying it is the voice of a god and not of a man,bible-kjv
13 2 as they ministered to the lord and fasted the holy ghost said separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them,bible-kjv
13 8 but elymas the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretation withstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith,bible-kjv
13 12 then the deputy when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the doctrine of the lord,bible-kjv
13 17 the god of this people of israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of egypt and with an high arm brought he them out of it,bible-kjv
13 22 and when he had removed him he raised up unto them david to be their king to whom also he gave their testimony and said i have found david the son of jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfil all my will,bible-kjv
13 26 men and brethren children of the stock of abraham and whosoever among you feareth god to you is the word of this salvation sent,bible-kjv
13 32 and we declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise which was made unto the fathers 13 33 god hath fulfilled the same unto us their children in that he hath raised up jesus again as it is also written in the second psalm thou art my son this day have i begotten thee,bible-kjv
13 40 beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the prophets 13 41 behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for i work a work in your days a work which ye shall in no wise believe though a man declare it unto you,bible-kjv
13 46 then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles,bible-kjv
13 51 but they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came unto iconium,bible-kjv
14 4 but the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the jews and part with the apostles,bible-kjv
14 12 and they called barnabas jupiter and paul mercurius because he was the chief speaker,bible-kjv
14 18 and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people that they had not done sacrifice unto them,bible-kjv
14 24 and after they had passed throughout pisidia they came to pamphylia,bible-kjv
15 2 when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that paul and barnabas and certain other of them should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question,bible-kjv
15 7 and when there had been much disputing peter rose up and said unto them men and brethren ye know how that a good while ago god made choice among us that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe,bible-kjv
15 13 and after they had held their peace james answered saying men and brethren hearken unto me 15 14 simeon hath declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name,bible-kjv
15 22 then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas namely judas surnamed barsabas and silas chief men among the brethren 15 23 and they wrote letters by them after this manner the apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia,bible-kjv
15 30 so when they were dismissed they came to antioch and when they had gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle 15 31 which when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation,bible-kjv
15 36 and some days after paul said unto barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord and see how they do,bible-kjv
16 1 then came he to derbe and lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a jewess and believed but his father was a greek 16 2 which was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium,bible-kjv
16 8 and they passing by mysia came down to troas,bible-kjv
16 14 and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyatira which worshipped god heard us whose heart the lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul,bible-kjv
but paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her,bible-kjv
16 25 and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them,bible-kjv
16 31 and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house,bible-kjv
16 36 and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul the magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peace,bible-kjv
16 40 and they went out of the prison and entered into the house of lydia and when they had seen the brethren they comforted them and departed,bible-kjv
17 8 and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these things,bible-kjv
17 13 but when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of god was preached of paul at berea they came thither also and stirred up the people,bible-kjv
17 18 then certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoicks encountered him,bible-kjv
17 21 for all the athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing,bible-kjv
17 29 forasmuch then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and man s device,bible-kjv
18 1 after these things paul departed from athens and came to corinth 18 2 and found a certain jew named aquila born in pontus lately come from italy with his wife priscilla because that claudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome and came unto them,bible-kjv
18 7 and he departed thence and entered into a certain man s house named justus one that worshipped god whose house joined hard to the synagogue,bible-kjv
18 14 and when paul was now about to open his mouth gallio said unto the jews if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness o ye jews reason would that i should bear with you 18 15 but if it be a question of words and names and of your law look ye to it for i will be no judge of such matters,bible-kjv
18 19 and he came to ephesus and left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews,bible-kjv
18 24 and a certain jew named apollos born at alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to ephesus,bible-kjv
and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost,bible-kjv
19 6 and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied,bible-kjv
19 11 and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul 19 12 so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them,bible-kjv
19 17 and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the lord jesus was magnified,bible-kjv
19 22 so he sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him timotheus and erastus but he himself stayed in asia for a season,bible-kjv
19 29 and the whole city was filled with confusion and having caught gaius and aristarchus men of macedonia paul s companions in travel they rushed with one accord into the theatre,bible-kjv
and alexander beckoned with the hand and would have made his defence unto the people,bible-kjv
19 38 wherefore if demetrius and the craftsmen which are with him have a matter against any man the law is open and there are deputies let them implead one another,bible-kjv
20 2 and when he had gone over those parts and had given them much exhortation he came into greece 20 3 and there abode three months,bible-kjv
20 7 and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight,bible-kjv
20 12 and they brought the young man alive and were not a little comforted,bible-kjv
20 17 and from miletus he sent to ephesus and called the elders of the church,bible-kjv
20 26 wherefore i take you to record this day that i am pure from the blood of all men,bible-kjv
20 31 therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears,bible-kjv
20 36 and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all,bible-kjv
21 4 and finding disciples we tarried there seven days who said to paul through the spirit that he should not go up to jerusalem,bible-kjv
21 9 and the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy,bible-kjv
for i am ready not to be bound only but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus,bible-kjv
21 18 and the day following paul went in with us unto james and all the elders were present,bible-kjv
21 23 do therefore this that we say to thee we have four men which have a vow on them 21 24 them take and purify thyself with them and be at charges with them that they may shave their heads and all may know that those things whereof they were informed concerning thee are nothing but that thou thyself also walkest orderly and keepest the law,bible-kjv
21 30 and all the city was moved and the people ran together and they took paul and drew him out of the temple and forthwith the doors were shut,bible-kjv
21 35 and when he came upon the stairs so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people,bible-kjv
21 39 but paul said i am a man which am a jew of tarsus a city in cilicia a citizen of no mean city and i beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the people,bible-kjv
22 5 as also the high priest doth bear me witness and all the estate of the elders from whom also i received letters unto the brethren and went to damascus to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem for to be punished,bible-kjv
22 9 and they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me,bible-kjv
and the same hour i looked up upon him,bible-kjv
22 17 and it came to pass that when i was come again to jerusalem even while i prayed in the temple i was in a trance 22 18 and saw him saying unto me make haste and get thee quickly out of jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me,bible-kjv
22 25 and as they bound him with thongs paul said unto the centurion that stood by is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman and uncondemned,bible-kjv
and paul said but i was free born,bible-kjv
23 3 then said paul unto him god shall smite thee thou whited wall for sittest thou to judge me after the law and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law,bible-kjv
23 8 for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but the pharisees confess both,bible-kjv
23 13 and they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy,bible-kjv
23 18 so he took him and brought him to the chief captain and said paul the prisoner called me unto him and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee who hath something to say unto thee,bible-kjv
23 23 and he called unto him two centurions saying make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesarea and horsemen threescore and ten and spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the night 23 24 and provide them beasts that they may set paul on and bring him safe unto felix the governor,bible-kjv
farewell,bible-kjv
and he commanded him to be kept in herod s judgment hall,bible-kjv
24 7 but the chief captain lysias came upon us and with great violence took him away out of our hands 24 8 commanding his accusers to come unto thee by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him,bible-kjv
24 16 and herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void to offence toward god and toward men,bible-kjv
24 22 and when felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge of that way he deferred them and said when lysias the chief captain shall come down i will know the uttermost of your matter,bible-kjv
24 27 but after two years porcius festus came into felix room and felix willing to shew the jews a pleasure left paul bound,bible-kjv
25 6 and when he had tarried among them more than ten days he went down unto caesarea and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought,bible-kjv
25 11 for if i be an offender or have committed any thing worthy of death i refuse not to die but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me no man may deliver me unto them,bible-kjv
25 14 and when they had been there many days festus declared paul s cause unto the king saying there is a certain man left in bonds by felix 25 15 about whom when i was at jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me desiring to have judgment against him,bible-kjv
25 21 but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of augustus i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar,bible-kjv
25 25 but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself hath appealed to augustus i have determined to send him,bible-kjv
then paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself 26 2 i think myself happy king agrippa because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of the jews 26 3 especially because i know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently,bible-kjv
26 9 i verily thought with myself that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth,bible-kjv
it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks,bible-kjv
26 21 for these causes the jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me,bible-kjv
26 27 king agrippa believest thou the prophets,bible-kjv
26 32 then said agrippa unto festus this man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto caesar,bible-kjv
27 4 and when we had launched from thence we sailed under cyprus because the winds were contrary,bible-kjv
27 11 nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by paul,bible-kjv
27 16 and running under a certain island which is called clauda we had much work to come by the boat 27 17 which when they had taken up they used helps undergirding the ship and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands strake sail and so were driven,bible-kjv
27 23 for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am and whom i serve 27 24 saying fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with thee,bible-kjv
27 30 and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship when they had let down the boat into the sea under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship 27 31 paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers except these abide in the ship ye cannot be saved,bible-kjv
27 36 then were they all of good cheer and they also took some meat,bible-kjv
27 41 and falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship aground and the forepart stuck fast and remained unmoveable but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves,bible-kjv
28 2 and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and received us every one because of the present rain and because of the cold,bible-kjv
28 7 in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island whose name was publius who received us and lodged us three days courteously,bible-kjv
28 13 and from thence we fetched a compass and came to rhegium and after one day the south wind blew and we came the next day to puteoli 28 14 where we found brethren and were desired to tarry with them seven days and so we went toward rome,bible-kjv
28 19 but when the jews spake against it i was constrained to appeal unto caesar not that i had ought to accuse my nation of,bible-kjv
28 24 and some believed the things which were spoken and some believed not,bible-kjv
the epistle of paul the apostle to the romans,bible-kjv
1 13 now i would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes i purposed to come unto you but was let hitherto that i might have some fruit among you also even as among other gentiles,bible-kjv
1 18 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness 1 19 because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them,bible-kjv
1 26 for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature 1 27 and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet,bible-kjv
2 4 or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance,bible-kjv
2 21 thou therefore which teachest another teachest thou not thyself,bible-kjv
2 24 for the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles through you as it is written,bible-kjv
3 1 what advantage then hath the jew,bible-kjv
3 4 god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged,bible-kjv
3 8 and not rather as we be slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say let us do evil that good may come,bible-kjv
3 12 they are all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good no not one,bible-kjv
3 27 where is boasting then,bible-kjv
3 28 therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law,bible-kjv
god forbid yea we establish the law,bible-kjv
4 4 now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt,bible-kjv
for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness,bible-kjv
4 13 for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith,bible-kjv
4 22 and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness,bible-kjv
5 7 for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die,bible-kjv
5 12 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned 5 13 for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law,bible-kjv
5 17 for if by one man s offence death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ,bible-kjv
6 1 what shall we say then,bible-kjv
6 4 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life,bible-kjv
6 11 likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord,bible-kjv
shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace,bible-kjv
6 19 i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness,bible-kjv
6 23 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord,bible-kjv
7 5 for when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death,bible-kjv
nay i had not known sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet,bible-kjv
7 11 for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew me,bible-kjv
7 14 for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin,bible-kjv
7 19 for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do,bible-kjv
who shall deliver me from the body of this death,bible-kjv
8 3 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh 8 4 that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit,bible-kjv
8 9 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you,bible-kjv
8 13 for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live,bible-kjv
8 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god,bible-kjv
8 25 but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it,bible-kjv
8 30 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified,bible-kjv
it is god that justifieth,bible-kjv
8 36 as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter,bible-kjv
amen,bible-kjv
9 10 and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac 9 11 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth 9 12 it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger,bible-kjv
9 15 for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion,bible-kjv
for who hath resisted his will,bible-kjv
9 25 as he saith also in osee i will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved,bible-kjv
that the gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith,bible-kjv
10 1 brethren my heart s desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved,bible-kjv
10 6 but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven,bible-kjv
10 10 for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation,bible-kjv
and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard,bible-kjv
for esaias saith lord who hath believed our report,bible-kjv
first moses saith i will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people and by a foolish nation i will anger you,bible-kjv
for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin,bible-kjv
i have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of baal,bible-kjv
israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded,bible-kjv
11 12 now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles how much more their fulness,bible-kjv
but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee,bible-kjv
11 23 and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed in for god is able to graff them in again,bible-kjv
11 29 for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance,bible-kjv
11 34 for who hath known the mind of the lord,bible-kjv
12 1 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service,bible-kjv
12 9 let love be without dissimulation,bible-kjv
12 16 be of the same mind one toward another,bible-kjv
12 18 if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men,bible-kjv
for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god,bible-kjv
but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of god a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil,bible-kjv
13 9 for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself,bible-kjv
13 14 but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof,bible-kjv
to his own master he standeth or falleth,bible-kjv
he that eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thanks and he that eateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thanks,bible-kjv
or why dost thou set at nought thy brother,bible-kjv
14 14 i know and am persuaded by the lord jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to him it is unclean,bible-kjv
14 19 let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another,bible-kjv
have it to thyself before god,bible-kjv
15 3 for even christ pleased not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me,bible-kjv
15 10 and again he saith rejoice ye gentiles with his people,bible-kjv
15 15 nevertheless brethren i have written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me of god 15 16 that i should be the minister of jesus christ to the gentiles ministering the gospel of god that the offering up of the gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by the holy ghost,bible-kjv
15 23 but now having no more place in these parts and having a great desire these many years to come unto you 15 24 whensoever i take my journey into spain i will come to you for i trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first i be somewhat filled with your company,bible-kjv
15 28 when therefore i have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit i will come by you into spain,bible-kjv
16 1 i commend unto you phebe our sister which is a servant of the church which is at cenchrea 16 2 that ye receive her in the lord as becometh saints and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you for she hath been a succourer of many and of myself also,bible-kjv
16 7 salute andronicus and junia my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners who are of note among the apostles who also were in christ before me,bible-kjv
16 11 salute herodion my kinsman,bible-kjv
16 14 salute asyncritus phlegon hermas patrobas hermes and the brethren which are with them,bible-kjv
16 18 for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple,bible-kjv
amen,bible-kjv
16 24 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all,bible-kjv
1 1 paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god and sosthenes our brother 1 2 unto the church of god which is at corinth to them that are sanctified in christ jesus called to be saints with all that in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord both their s and our s 1 3 grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ,bible-kjv
1 12 now this i say that every one of you saith i am of paul and i of apollos and i of cephas and i of christ,bible-kjv
1 16 and i baptized also the household of stephanas besides i know not whether i baptized any other,bible-kjv
where is the scribe,bible-kjv
1 25 because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men,bible-kjv
2 3 and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling,bible-kjv
2 11 for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him,bible-kjv
2 15 but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man,bible-kjv
3 3 for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men,bible-kjv
3 8 now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour,bible-kjv
3 12 now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble 3 13 every man s work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every man s work of what sort it is,bible-kjv
3 18 let no man deceive himself,bible-kjv
3 21 therefore let no man glory in men,bible-kjv
4 4 for i know nothing by myself yet am i not hereby justified but he that judgeth me is the lord,bible-kjv
now if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it,bible-kjv
4 14 i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn you,bible-kjv
4 19 but i will come to you shortly if the lord will and will know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power,bible-kjv
5 2 and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you,bible-kjv
for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us 5 8 therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth,bible-kjv
5 13 but them that are without god judgeth,bible-kjv
6 3 know ye not that we shall judge angels,bible-kjv
no not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren,bible-kjv
6 8 nay ye do wrong and defraud and that your brethren,bible-kjv
6 13 meats for the belly and the belly for meats but god shall destroy both it and them,bible-kjv
god forbid,bible-kjv
6 18 flee fornication,bible-kjv
7 1 now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman,bible-kjv
7 6 but i speak this by permission and not of commandment,bible-kjv
7 10 and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband 7 11 but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife,bible-kjv
a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases but god hath called us to peace,bible-kjv
7 18 is any man called being circumcised,bible-kjv
7 20 let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called,bible-kjv
7 24 brethren let every man wherein he is called therein abide with god,bible-kjv
art thou loosed from a wife,bible-kjv
7 32 but i would have you without carefulness,bible-kjv
7 36 but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin if she pass the flower of her age and need so require let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry,bible-kjv
8 1 now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge,bible-kjv
8 5 for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be gods many and lords many 8 6 but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him,bible-kjv
8 12 but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against christ,bible-kjv
are not ye my work in the lord,bible-kjv
9 7 who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges,bible-kjv
9 9 for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn,bible-kjv
9 12 if others be partakers of this power over you are not we rather,bible-kjv
9 15 but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void,bible-kjv
9 19 for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more,bible-kjv
so run that ye may obtain,bible-kjv
10 5 but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness,bible-kjv
10 10 neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer,bible-kjv
10 15 i speak as to wise men judge ye what i say,bible-kjv
10 19 what say i then,bible-kjv
are we stronger than he,bible-kjv
10 28 but if any man say unto you this is offered in sacrifice unto idols eat not for his sake that shewed it and for conscience sake for the earth is the lord s and the fulness thereof 10 29 conscience i say not thine own but of the other for why is my liberty judged of another man s conscience,bible-kjv
11 2 now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you,bible-kjv
11 7 for a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man,bible-kjv
11 12 for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of god,bible-kjv
11 17 now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse,bible-kjv
11 22 what,bible-kjv
i praise you not,bible-kjv
11 28 but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup,bible-kjv
11 33 wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one for another,bible-kjv
12 3 wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost,bible-kjv
12 8 for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit 12 9 to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit 12 10 to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues 12 11 but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will,bible-kjv
12 16 and if the ear shall say because i am not the eye i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body,bible-kjv
12 20 but now are they many members yet but one body,bible-kjv
12 26 and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it,bible-kjv
are all teachers,bible-kjv
12 31 but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way,bible-kjv
13 8 charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away,bible-kjv
13 13 and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity,bible-kjv
14 5 i would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying,bible-kjv
for ye shall speak into the air,bible-kjv
14 14 for if i pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful,bible-kjv
14 18 i thank my god i speak with tongues more than ye all 14 19 yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue,bible-kjv
14 24 but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all 14 25 and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship god and report that god is in you of a truth,bible-kjv
14 28 but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to god,bible-kjv
14 33 for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints,bible-kjv
or came it unto you only,bible-kjv
15 1 moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand 15 2 by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain,bible-kjv
15 10 but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me,bible-kjv
15 16 for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised 15 17 and if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins,bible-kjv
15 22 for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive,bible-kjv
15 27 for he hath put all things under his feet,bible-kjv
15 30 and why stand we in jeopardy every hour,bible-kjv
15 34 awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god i speak this to your shame,bible-kjv
15 40 there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another,bible-kjv
15 45 and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit,bible-kjv
15 50 now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption,bible-kjv
o grave where is thy victory,bible-kjv
16 2 upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as god hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come,bible-kjv
16 7 for i will not see you now by the way but i trust to tarry a while with you if the lord permit,bible-kjv
16 12 as touching our brother apollos i greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren but his will was not at all to come at this time but he will come when he shall have convenient time,bible-kjv
16 18 for they have refreshed my spirit and your s therefore acknowledge ye them that are such,bible-kjv
16 21 the salutation of me paul with mine own hand,bible-kjv
the second epistle of paul the apostle to the corinthians,bible-kjv
1 7 and our hope of you is stedfast knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings so shall ye be also of the consolation,bible-kjv
1 17 when i therefore was thus minded did i use lightness,bible-kjv
1 21 now he which stablisheth us with you in christ and hath anointed us is god 1 22 who hath also sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts,bible-kjv
2 3 and i wrote this same unto you lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all,bible-kjv
2 8 wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him,bible-kjv
2 15 for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish 2 16 to the one we are the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life,bible-kjv
3 2 ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men 3 3 forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart,bible-kjv
3 11 for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious,bible-kjv
3 18 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord,bible-kjv
4 7 but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us,bible-kjv
4 15 for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god,bible-kjv
5 4 for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life,bible-kjv
5 11 knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto god and i trust also are made manifest in your consciences,bible-kjv
5 17 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new,bible-kjv
6 2 for he saith i have heard thee in a time accepted and in the day of salvation have i succoured thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation,bible-kjv
6 14 be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness,bible-kjv
for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people,bible-kjv
7 3 i speak not this to condemn you for i have said before that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you,bible-kjv
7 9 now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing,bible-kjv
7 13 therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of titus because his spirit was refreshed by you all,bible-kjv
8 3 for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselves 8 4 praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints,bible-kjv
8 9 for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich,bible-kjv
8 16 but thanks be to god which put the same earnest care into the heart of titus for you,bible-kjv
8 24 wherefore shew ye to them and before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf,bible-kjv
9 7 every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver,bible-kjv
10 1 now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ who in presence am base among you but being absent am bold toward you 10 2 but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh,bible-kjv
10 10 for his letters say they are weighty and powerful but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible,bible-kjv
10 17 but he that glorieth let him glory in the lord,bible-kjv
11 4 for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him,bible-kjv
11 9 and when i was present with you and wanted i was chargeable to no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia supplied and in all things i have kept myself from being burdensome unto you and so will i keep myself,bible-kjv
11 12 but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be found even as we,bible-kjv
11 17 that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting,bible-kjv
howbeit whereinsoever any is bold i speak foolishly i am bold also,bible-kjv
are they the seed of abraham,bible-kjv
11 25 thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep 11 26 in journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in perils by mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren 11 27 in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness,bible-kjv
11 31 the god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessed for evermore knoweth that i lie not,bible-kjv
12 3 and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth 12 4 how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter,bible-kjv
12 9 and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness,bible-kjv
12 13 for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches except it be that i myself was not burdensome to you,bible-kjv
12 17 did i make a gain of you by any of them whom i sent unto you,bible-kjv
12 19 again think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you,bible-kjv
13 2 i told you before and foretell you as if i were present the second time and being absent now i write to them which heretofore have sinned and to all other that if i come again i will not spare 13 3 since ye seek a proof of christ speaking in me which to you ward is not weak but is mighty in you,bible-kjv
13 6 but i trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates,bible-kjv
13 11 finally brethren farewell,bible-kjv
amen,bible-kjv
1 8 but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed,bible-kjv
1 11 but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man,bible-kjv
1 19 but other of the apostles saw i none save james the lord s brother,bible-kjv
2 2 and i went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation lest by any means i should run or had run in vain,bible-kjv
2 12 for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision,bible-kjv
god forbid,bible-kjv
3 1 o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you,bible-kjv
if it be yet in vain,bible-kjv
3 9 so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham,bible-kjv
3 15 brethren i speak after the manner of men though it be but a man s covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth thereto,bible-kjv
3 19 wherefore then serveth the law,bible-kjv
3 22 but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe,bible-kjv
3 27 for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ,bible-kjv
4 6 and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father,bible-kjv
4 11 i am afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain,bible-kjv
for i bear you record that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me,bible-kjv
4 21 tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the law,bible-kjv
4 26 but jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all,bible-kjv
cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman,bible-kjv
5 4 christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace,bible-kjv
5 9 a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump,bible-kjv
5 13 for brethren ye have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another,bible-kjv
5 18 but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law,bible-kjv
5 26 let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another envying one another,bible-kjv
6 5 for every man shall bear his own burden,bible-kjv
6 10 as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith,bible-kjv
6 15 for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but a new creature,bible-kjv
the epistle of paul the apostle to the ephesians,bible-kjv
1 15 wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints 1 16 cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers 1 17 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him 1 18 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints 1 19 and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us ward who believe according to the working of his mighty power 1 20 which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places 1 21 far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come 1 22 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church 1 23 which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all,bible-kjv
2 11 wherefore remember that ye being in time past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands 2 12 that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world 2 13 but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ,bible-kjv
3 8 unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ 3 9 and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ 3 10 to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god 3 11 according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord 3 12 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him,bible-kjv
4 1 i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called 4 2 with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love 4 3 endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,bible-kjv
4 10 he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things,bible-kjv
4 26 be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath 4 27 neither give place to the devil,bible-kjv
5 1 be ye therefore followers of god as dear children 5 2 and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour,bible-kjv
5 8 for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the lord walk as children of light 5 9 for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth 5 10 proving what is acceptable unto the lord,bible-kjv
5 15 see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise 5 16 redeeming the time because the days are evil,bible-kjv
5 24 therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing,bible-kjv
5 31 for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh,bible-kjv
6 4 and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord,bible-kjv
6 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places,bible-kjv
6 23 peace be to the brethren and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ,bible-kjv
1 3 i thank my god upon every remembrance of you 1 4 always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy 1 5 for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now 1 6 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ 1 7 even as it is meet for me to think this of you all because i have you in my heart inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel ye all are partakers of my grace,bible-kjv
1 15 some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife and some also of good will 1 16 the one preach christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds 1 17 but the other of love knowing that i am set for the defence of the gospel,bible-kjv
1 22 but if i live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labour yet what i shall choose i wot not,bible-kjv
2 1 if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies 2 2 fulfil ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love being of one accord of one mind,bible-kjv
2 12 wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,bible-kjv
2 19 but i trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus shortly unto you that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state,bible-kjv
2 24 but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly,bible-kjv
2 29 receive him therefore in the lord with all gladness and hold such in reputation 2 30 because for the work of christ he was nigh unto death not regarding his life to supply your lack of service toward me,bible-kjv
3 4 though i might also have confidence in the flesh,bible-kjv
3 13 brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before 3 14 i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus,bible-kjv
3 20 for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the saviour the lord jesus christ 3 21 who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself,bible-kjv
4 5 let your moderation be known unto all men,bible-kjv
4 9 those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you,bible-kjv
4 14 notwithstanding ye have well done that ye did communicate with my affliction,bible-kjv
4 19 but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus,bible-kjv
4 22 all the saints salute you chiefly they that are of caesar s household,bible-kjv
1 3 we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ praying always for you 1 4 since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which ye have to all the saints 1 5 for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel 1 6 which is come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in you since the day ye heard of it and knew the grace of god in truth 1 7 as ye also learned of epaphras our dear fellowservant who is for you a faithful minister of christ 1 8 who also declared unto us your love in the spirit,bible-kjv
2 1 for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh 2 2 that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ 2 3 in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,bible-kjv
2 9 for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily,bible-kjv
2 20 wherefore if ye be dead with christ from the rudiments of the world why as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinances 2 21 touch not taste not handle not 2 22 which all are to perish with the using after the commandments and doctrines of men,bible-kjv
3 4 when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory,bible-kjv
3 14 and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness,bible-kjv
3 19 husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them,bible-kjv
4 1 masters give unto your servants that which is just and equal knowing that ye also have a master in heaven,bible-kjv
they shall make known unto you all things which are done here,bible-kjv
4 14 luke the beloved physician and demas greet you,bible-kjv
remember my bonds,bible-kjv
1 2 we give thanks to god always for you all making mention of you in our prayers 1 3 remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labour of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ in the sight of god and our father 1 4 knowing brethren beloved your election of god,bible-kjv
1 9 for they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god 1 10 and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come,bible-kjv
2 9 for ye remember brethren our labour and travail for labouring night and day because we would not be chargeable unto any of you we preached unto you the gospel of god,bible-kjv
2 18 wherefore we would have come unto you even i paul once and again but satan hindered us,bible-kjv
3 4 for verily when we were with you we told you before that we should suffer tribulation even as it came to pass and ye know,bible-kjv
3 12 and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all men even as we do toward you 3 13 to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god even our father at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints,bible-kjv
4 8 he therefore that despiseth despiseth not man but god who hath also given unto us his holy spirit,bible-kjv
4 15 for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep,bible-kjv
5 3 for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape,bible-kjv
5 8 but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation,bible-kjv
5 14 now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feebleminded support the weak be patient toward all men,bible-kjv
5 19 quench not the spirit,bible-kjv
5 24 faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it,bible-kjv
amen,bible-kjv
2 1 now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him 2 2 that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of christ is at hand,bible-kjv
2 8 and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming 2 9 even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders 2 10 and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved,bible-kjv
3 1 finally brethren pray for us that the word of the lord may have free course and be glorified even as it is with you 3 2 and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have not faith,bible-kjv
3 7 for yourselves know how ye ought to follow us for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you 3 8 neither did we eat any man s bread for nought but wrought with labour and travail night and day that we might not be chargeable to any of you 3 9 not because we have not power but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us,bible-kjv
3 14 and if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed,bible-kjv
3 18 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all,bible-kjv
1 5 now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned 1 6 from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling 1 7 desiring to be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm,bible-kjv
1 16 howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy that in me first jesus christ might shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting,bible-kjv
2 3 for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour 2 4 who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth,bible-kjv
2 11 let the woman learn in silence with all subjection,bible-kjv
3 1 this is a true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he desireth a good work,bible-kjv
3 10 and let these also first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless,bible-kjv
3 16 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory,bible-kjv
4 8 for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come,bible-kjv
4 13 till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine,bible-kjv
5 3 honour widows that are widows indeed,bible-kjv
5 8 but if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel,bible-kjv
5 14 i will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully,bible-kjv
and the labourer is worthy of his reward,bible-kjv
5 23 drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomach s sake and thine often infirmities,bible-kjv
these things teach and exhort,bible-kjv
6 9 but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition,bible-kjv
amen,bible-kjv
the second epistle of paul the apostle to timothy,bible-kjv
1 8 be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god 1 9 who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began 1 10 but is now made manifest by the appearing of our saviour jesus christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel 1 11 whereunto i am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles,bible-kjv
1 16 the lord give mercy unto the house of onesiphorus for he oft refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain 1 17 but when he was in rome he sought me out very diligently and found me,bible-kjv
2 4 no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier,bible-kjv
2 10 therefore i endure all things for the elect s sakes that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory,bible-kjv
2 17 and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hymenaeus and philetus 2 18 who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection is past already and overthrow the faith of some,bible-kjv
2 22 flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart,bible-kjv
3 6 for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts 3 7 ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth,bible-kjv
3 13 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived,bible-kjv
4 5 but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry,bible-kjv
take mark and bring him with thee for he is profitable to me for the ministry,bible-kjv
4 17 notwithstanding the lord stood with me and strengthened me that by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the gentiles might hear and i was delivered out of the mouth of the lion,bible-kjv
4 21 do thy diligence to come before winter,bible-kjv
the epistle of paul the apostle to titus,bible-kjv
1 12 one of themselves even a prophet of their own said the cretians are alway liars evil beasts slow bellies,bible-kjv
2 1 but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine 2 2 that the aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity in patience,bible-kjv
2 11 for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men 2 12 teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world 2 13 looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ 2 14 who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works,bible-kjv
3 4 but after that the kindness and love of god our saviour toward man appeared 3 5 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost 3 6 which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our saviour 3 7 that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life,bible-kjv
3 12 when i shall send artemas unto thee or tychicus be diligent to come unto me to nicopolis for i have determined there to winter,bible-kjv
grace be with you all,bible-kjv
1 7 for we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee brother,bible-kjv
1 18 if he hath wronged thee or oweth thee ought put that on mine account 1 19 i paul have written it with mine own hand i will repay it albeit i do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides,bible-kjv
1 25 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit,bible-kjv
and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son,bible-kjv
1 10 and thou lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands 1 11 they shall perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth a garment 1 12 and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail,bible-kjv
2 5 for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak,bible-kjv
but now we see not yet all things put under him,bible-kjv
and again behold i and the children which god hath given me,bible-kjv
3 1 wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus 3 2 who was faithful to him that appointed him as also moses was faithful in all his house,bible-kjv
3 10 wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do alway err in their heart and they have not known my ways,bible-kjv
3 16 for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses,bible-kjv
4 1 let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it,bible-kjv
4 6 seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief 4 7 again he limiteth a certain day saying in david to day after so long a time as it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts,bible-kjv
4 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart,bible-kjv
5 1 for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins 5 2 who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity,bible-kjv
5 7 who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared 5 8 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered 5 9 and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him 5 10 called of god an high priest after the order of melchisedec,bible-kjv
6 1 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god 6 2 of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment,bible-kjv
6 10 for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love which ye have shewed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister,bible-kjv
6 17 wherein god willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath 6 18 that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us 6 19 which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into that within the veil 6 20 whither the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec,bible-kjv
7 8 and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth,bible-kjv
7 13 for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar,bible-kjv
7 19 for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto god,bible-kjv
7 28 for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated for evermore,bible-kjv
8 7 for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second,bible-kjv
now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away,bible-kjv
9 7 but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people 9 8 the holy ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first tabernacle was yet standing 9 9 which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience 9 10 which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation,bible-kjv
9 17 for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth,bible-kjv
9 23 it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these,bible-kjv
because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins,bible-kjv
10 8 above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasure therein which are offered by the law 10 9 then said he lo i come to do thy will o god,bible-kjv
10 15 whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before 10 16 this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them 10 17 and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more,bible-kjv
10 28 he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses 10 29 of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace,bible-kjv
10 34 for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance,bible-kjv
10 39 but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul,bible-kjv
11 5 by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god,bible-kjv
11 11 through faith also sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised,bible-kjv
11 16 but now they desire a better country that is an heavenly wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a city,bible-kjv
11 23 by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king s commandment,bible-kjv
11 30 by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days,bible-kjv
11 35 women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection 11 36 and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment 11 37 they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented 11 38 of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth,bible-kjv
12 5 and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him 12 6 for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth,bible-kjv
12 11 now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby,bible-kjv
12 25 see that ye refuse not him that speaketh,bible-kjv
13 2 be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares,bible-kjv
13 7 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation,bible-kjv
13 11 for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp,bible-kjv
13 16 but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices god is well pleased,bible-kjv
amen,bible-kjv
13 25 grace be with you all,bible-kjv
1 4 but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing,bible-kjv
1 8 a double minded man is unstable in all his ways,bible-kjv
1 15 then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death,bible-kjv
1 21 wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls,bible-kjv
1 27 pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world,bible-kjv
do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats,bible-kjv
now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill thou art become a transgressor of the law,bible-kjv
2 15 if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food 2 16 and one of you say unto them depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it profit,bible-kjv
2 21 was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar,bible-kjv
2 26 for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also,bible-kjv
3 4 behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helm whithersoever the governor listeth,bible-kjv
3 9 therewith bless we god even the father and therewith curse we men which are made after the similitude of god,bible-kjv
either a vine figs,bible-kjv
3 15 this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish,bible-kjv
come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members,bible-kjv
4 5 do ye think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy,bible-kjv
4 8 draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you,bible-kjv
he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law but if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but a judge,bible-kjv
4 15 for that ye ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do this or that,bible-kjv
5 3 your gold and silver is cankered and the rust of them shall be a witness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire,bible-kjv
5 7 be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord,bible-kjv
5 11 behold we count them happy which endure,bible-kjv
is any merry,bible-kjv
the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much,bible-kjv
1 1 peter an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia 1 2 elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied,bible-kjv
1 13 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ 1 14 as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance 1 15 but as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation 1 16 because it is written be ye holy for i am holy,bible-kjv
and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you,bible-kjv
2 9 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light 2 10 which in time past were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy,bible-kjv
love the brotherhood,bible-kjv
2 20 for what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently,bible-kjv
3 3 whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel 3 4 but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price,bible-kjv
3 12 for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the lord is against them that do evil,bible-kjv
3 21 the like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ 3 22 who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him,bible-kjv
4 8 and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins,bible-kjv
4 12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you 4 13 but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of christ s sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy,bible-kjv
4 18 and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear,bible-kjv
yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble,bible-kjv
amen,bible-kjv
amen,bible-kjv
1 9 but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins,bible-kjv
1 16 for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty,bible-kjv
2 1 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction,bible-kjv
2 11 whereas angels which are greater in power and might bring not railing accusation against them before the lord,bible-kjv
2 19 while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage,bible-kjv
for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation,bible-kjv
3 11 seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness 3 12 looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat,bible-kjv
3 18 but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ,bible-kjv
1 4 and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full,bible-kjv
1 10 if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us,bible-kjv
2 5 but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him,bible-kjv
2 9 he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now,bible-kjv
i write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one,bible-kjv
if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him,bible-kjv
2 20 but ye have an unction from the holy one and ye know all things,bible-kjv
2 24 let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning,bible-kjv
2 28 and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming,bible-kjv
3 4 whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law,bible-kjv
for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil,bible-kjv
and wherefore slew he him,bible-kjv
3 15 whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him,bible-kjv
3 20 for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things,bible-kjv
and hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath given us,bible-kjv
4 6 we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us,bible-kjv
4 10 herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins,bible-kjv
4 14 and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world,bible-kjv
4 18 there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment,bible-kjv
5 1 whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him,bible-kjv
5 6 this is he that came by water and blood even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood,bible-kjv
5 10 he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in himself he that believeth not god hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record that god gave of his son,bible-kjv
5 16 if any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death,bible-kjv
5 20 and we know that the son of god is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son jesus christ,bible-kjv
1 1 the elder unto the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not i only but also all they that have known the truth 1 2 for the truth s sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever,bible-kjv
this is the commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning ye should walk in it,bible-kjv
he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he hath both the father and the son,bible-kjv
the third epistle general of john,bible-kjv
1 5 beloved thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren and to strangers 1 6 which have borne witness of thy charity before the church whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort thou shalt do well 1 7 because that for his name s sake they went forth taking nothing of the gentiles,bible-kjv
he that doeth good is of god but he that doeth evil hath not seen god,bible-kjv
greet the friends by name,bible-kjv
1 5 i will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not,bible-kjv
1 10 but these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves,bible-kjv
1 16 these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lusts and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having men s persons in admiration because of advantage,bible-kjv
1 24 now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy 1 25 to the only wise god our saviour be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and ever,bible-kjv
1 4 john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne 1 5 and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth,bible-kjv
1 8 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty,bible-kjv
1 14 his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire 1 15 and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters,bible-kjv
the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches,bible-kjv
2 7 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god,bible-kjv
2 14 but i have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication,bible-kjv
2 20 notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols,bible-kjv
2 25 but that which ye have already hold fast till i come,bible-kjv
3 2 be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found thy works perfect before god,bible-kjv
3 6 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches,bible-kjv
3 12 him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name,bible-kjv
3 19 as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent,bible-kjv
4 2 and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne,bible-kjv
4 7 and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle,bible-kjv
5 3 and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon,bible-kjv
5 8 and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saints,bible-kjv
and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever,bible-kjv
6 5 and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see,bible-kjv
and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth,bible-kjv
6 15 and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains 6 16 and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb 6 17 for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand,bible-kjv
of the tribe of reuben were sealed twelve thousand,bible-kjv
7 7 of the tribe of simeon were sealed twelve thousand,bible-kjv
of the tribe of benjamin were sealed twelve thousand,bible-kjv
and whence came they,bible-kjv
7 17 for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes,bible-kjv
8 5 and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it into the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake,bible-kjv
8 12 and the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shone not for a third part of it and the night likewise,bible-kjv
9 4 and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of god in their foreheads,bible-kjv
9 9 and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle,bible-kjv
9 15 and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men,bible-kjv
9 20 and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk 9 21 neither repented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their thefts,bible-kjv
10 9 and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book,bible-kjv
11 2 but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months,bible-kjv
11 7 and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them,bible-kjv
11 12 and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither,bible-kjv
11 16 and the four and twenty elders which sat before god on their seats fell upon their faces and worshipped god 11 17 saying we give thee thanks o lord god almighty which art and wast and art to come because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned,bible-kjv
12 4 and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born,bible-kjv
12 10 and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night,bible-kjv
12 13 and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child,bible-kjv
13 1 and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy,bible-kjv
13 5 and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months,bible-kjv
13 10 he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword,bible-kjv
13 15 and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed,bible-kjv
14 2 and i heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great thunder and i heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps 14 3 and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth,bible-kjv
14 6 and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people 14 7 saying with a loud voice fear god and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters,bible-kjv
14 14 and i looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle,bible-kjv
14 19 and the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of god,bible-kjv
15 4 who shall not fear thee o lord and glorify thy name,bible-kjv
16 1 and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels go your ways and pour out the vials of the wrath of god upon the earth,bible-kjv
16 6 for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink for they are worthy,bible-kjv
16 12 and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared,bible-kjv
16 16 and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon,bible-kjv
16 21 and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven every stone about the weight of a talent and men blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail for the plague thereof was exceeding great,bible-kjv
17 7 and the angel said unto me wherefore didst thou marvel,bible-kjv
17 10 and there are seven kings five are fallen and one is and the other is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a short space,bible-kjv
17 15 and he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where the whore sitteth are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues,bible-kjv
18 2 and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird,bible-kjv
18 7 how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow,bible-kjv
18 14 and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at all,bible-kjv
for in one hour is she made desolate,bible-kjv
19 1 and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honour and power unto the lord our god 19 2 for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand,bible-kjv
19 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready,bible-kjv
and he said unto me see thou do it not i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy,bible-kjv
19 15 and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god,bible-kjv
these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone,bible-kjv
20 5 but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished,bible-kjv
20 10 and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever,bible-kjv
this is the second death,bible-kjv
21 4 and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away,bible-kjv
i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely,bible-kjv
21 14 and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb,bible-kjv
21 18 and the building of the wall of it was of jasper and the city was pure gold like unto clear glass,bible-kjv
21 23 and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof,bible-kjv
22 1 and he shewed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb,bible-kjv
22 7 behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book,bible-kjv
22 11 he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still,bible-kjv
22 16 i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches,bible-kjv
and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely,bible-kjv
22 21 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all,bible-kjv

the little jackals danced on ahead and the lion stalked behind,bryant-stories
he lives down there,bryant-stories
but the lion in the water made just as terrible a one back,bryant-stories
so the poor old lion floundered about and floundered about and as he couldn t get up the steep sides of the well he was at last drowned,bryant-stories
the lion is dead,bryant-stories
the country mouse and the city mouse,bryant-stories
you must come to visit me and see how nice it is to live in the city,bryant-stories
the two little mice nibbled and nibbled and the country mouse thought he had never tasted anything so delicious in his life,bryant-stories
the little country mouse was shaking all over when they got safely away but the little city mouse said that is nothing she will soon go away and then we can go back,bryant-stories
but all at once in the midst of their eating there came a scratching at the door and a sharp loud,bryant-stories
the country mouse ran after you may be sure as fast as could,bryant-stories
on the shelves were jars of butter and cheeses in bags and out of bags,bryant-stories
stop,bryant-stories
that thing is a trap said the little city mouse,bryant-stories
so the little country mouse went back to his home and there he stayed all the rest of his life,bryant-stories
roll me around,bryant-stories
his mother pushed him about in her sleep until her slumber became too sound then she stopped,bryant-stories
roll around,bryant-stories
the moon laughed at the sight but when little jack rollaround saw the moon he called out open the door old moon,bryant-stories
so the good moon made a light and went along with him and the little trundle bed boat went sailing down the streets into the main street of the village,bryant-stories
then i ll go to the woods so that the animals may see me said little jack,bryant-stories
cried the little boy and the trundle bed went trundling among the trees in the great wood scaring up the squirrels and startling the little leaves on the trees,bryant-stories
i will go with you make a path,bryant-stories
out of the way there,bryant-stories
but jack rollaround only behaved the worse get out of the way old moon,bryant-stories
make a light,bryant-stories
he thought it was the moon,bryant-stories
she said,bryant-stories
little brother rabbit crouched down and listened to what they were saying,bryant-stories
they won t rule me he said,bryant-stories
and i can t pull her out,bryant-stories
huh,bryant-stories
asked the elephant,bryant-stories
then said little brother rabbit i will tie one end of this long rope to your trunk and the other to my cow and as soon as i have tied her tightly i will beat my big drum,bryant-stories
there he sat down and beat the big drum,bryant-stories
said the whale,bryant-stories
but when the whale found himself sliding toward the land he was so provoked with the cow that he dived head first down to the bottom of the sea,bryant-stories
at the jerk up came the whale out of the water,bryant-stories
and then each saw the rope in the other s hold,bryant-stories
and they began to pull again,bryant-stories
the little half chick,bryant-stories
it was just half a chicken,bryant-stories
one day the little half chick said mother i am off to madrid to see the king,bryant-stories
when he had gone some distance the little half chick came to a little brook that was caught in the weeds and in much trouble,bryant-stories
and in spite of the brook s begging he went away hoppity kick hoppity kick,bryant-stories
the idea,bryant-stories
the wind was whimpering and begging to be set free,bryant-stories
i am going to madrid to see the king,bryant-stories
the very thing for the king s dinner,bryant-stories
it was terribly uncomfortable,bryant-stories
now the water grew warm hot hotter frightfully hot the little half chick cried out do not burn so hot fire,bryant-stories
dear me she said this chicken is no good it is burned to a cinder,bryant-stories
little half chick little half chick said the wind when i was in trouble you would not help me,bryant-stories
a little boy sat at his mother s knees by the long western window looking out into the garden,bryant-stories
what are you thinking about my darling,bryant-stories
the wind blows cold and here it is dark and lonely but that little boy is warm and happy and safe at his mother s knees,bryant-stories
then the snow will sink down and wrap me close,bryant-stories
and here i wait patiently,bryant-stories
then through all my twigs i feel the slow sap stirring,bryant-stories
the little blackberry bush is alive and beautiful and green,bryant-stories
carefully i hold them up to the sun carefully i gather the dew in the summer nights slowly they ripen they grow larger and redder and darker and at last they are black shining delicious,bryant-stories
from the window he watches me and thinks there is the little blackberry bush that was so kind to me,bryant-stories
his mother took him up in her arms and they went out to supper and left the blackberry bush nodding up and down in the wind and there it is nodding yet,bryant-stories
high on the hilltop the old king sits he is now so old and gray he s nigh lost his wits,bryant-stories
by the craggy hillside through the mosses bare they have planted thorn trees for pleasure here and there,bryant-stories
once upon a time there was a little brown field mouse and one day he was out in the fields to see what he could find,bryant-stories
little mr field mouse ran to the root and poked his nose under after the acorn and there he saw a small round hole in the ground,bryant-stories
quickly the little door opened and the acorn rolled inside,bryant-stories
you are my prisoner he said to the field mouse,bryant-stories
no it isn t said the little red man i have it you will never see it again,bryant-stories
you shall be my servant you shall make my bed and sweep my room and cook my broth,bryant-stories
he went away without noticing he was in such a hurry,bryant-stories
finally he climbed up on a chair and opened a wee wee door in the chimney piece and there it was,bryant-stories
and what do you think,bryant-stories
and when she wasn t wearing it she kept it in the shiny acorn box,bryant-stories
many and many a night this old fox used to lie awake and think to himself how good that little red hen would taste if he could once get her in his big kettle and boil her for dinner,bryant-stories
then he took a big bag and slung it over his shoulder and walked till he came to the little red hen s house,bryant-stories
just as she said it she turned round and there stood the ugly old fox with his big bag over his shoulder,bryant-stories
can t i though,bryant-stories
she dropped off and the old fox picked her up and put her in his bag slung the bag over his shoulder and started for home where the kettle was boiling,bryant-stories
then she ran as fast as she could till she came to her own little farmhouse and she went in and locked the door with the big key,bryant-stories
as soon as his mother opened the door he said is the kettle boiling,bryant-stories
the fox lifted the big heavy bag up till it was over the open kettle and gave it a shake,bryant-stories
and they were scalded to death,bryant-stories
there lived out o er the hill in a great din o rocks a crafty shly and wicked ould folly iv a fox,bryant-stories
but at last there came a schame intil his wicked head and he tuk a great big bag and to his mither said,bryant-stories

epaminondas took it in his fist and held it all crunched up tight like this and came along home,bryant-stories

you hear me epaminondas,bryant-stories
pretty soon the butter began to melt,bryant-stories
epaminondas what you got in your hat,bryant-stories

you see these here six mince pies i done make,bryant-stories
the six mince pies sat cooling in a row on the doorstep,bryant-stories
the person who told me the story didn t know nobody knows,bryant-stories
so he ran toward the village crying out with all his might,bryant-stories
the kind villagers left their work and ran to the field to help him,bryant-stories
wolf,bryant-stories
the villagers heard him but they thought it was another mean trick no one paid the least attention or went near him,bryant-stories
the frogs in a certain swamp decided that they needed a king they had always got along perfectly well without one but they suddenly made up their minds that a king they must have,bryant-stories
and as soon as they found he really could not hurt them they began to despise him and finally they sent another messenger to jove to ask for a new king,bryant-stories
it was too much jove was angry at their stupidity at last,bryant-stories
he was indeed a king worthy of them,bryant-stories
here is a chance to test our strength said the wind let us see which of us is strong enough to make that traveller take off his cloak the one who can do that shall be acknowledged the more powerful,bryant-stories
now it was the sun s turn,bryant-stories
the little jackal was very fond of shell fish,bryant-stories
thought the little jackal the big alligator has my paw in his mouth,bryant-stories
so he put on a very cheerful voice as if nothing at all were the matter and he said,bryant-stories
i hope you ll find it very tender,bryant-stories
the little jackal ran away as fast as he could and as he ran he called out,bryant-stories
after this the little jackal kept away from the river out of danger,bryant-stories
he said,bryant-stories
so he stuck the black end of his snout above the water and waited,bryant-stories
i will have dinner elsewhere,bryant-stories
very cautiously he went down to the river and looked all around,bryant-stories
when i don t see any little crabs on the shore or sticking up out of the water i usually see them blowing bubbles from under the water the little bubbles go puff and then they go pop and they show me where the little juicy crabs are so i can put my paw in and catch them,bryant-stories
the little jackal didn t have to be told who was underneath those bubbles he took one quick look and off he ran,bryant-stories
i ll breakfast at another part of the river,bryant-stories
so he crept and crawled and dragged himself over the ground to the garden of wild figs,bryant-stories
i ll investigate a bit,bryant-stories
bother the suspicious little jackal,bryant-stories
but as he ran he called back,bryant-stories
then he crept and crawled inside and hid himself there in the house to wait till the little jackal should come home,bryant-stories
what s this,bryant-stories
the little jackal said,bryant-stories
why don t you speak to me little house,bryant-stories
hullo little jackal,bryant-stories
he thought very fast,bryant-stories
the larks in the cornfield,bryant-stories
oh mother dear mother they said you must move us away to night,bryant-stories
the next night the little larks were quite trembling with fear the moment their mother got home they cried out mother you must surely move us to night,bryant-stories
the third night when the mother lark came home the baby larks said mother dear the farmer came to the field to day and when he looked at the corn he was quite angry he said this will never do,bryant-stories
a true story about a girl,bryant-stories
and there was a big barn,bryant-stories
she liked to make up stories out of her own head and sometimes she made verses,bryant-stories
it was great fun,bryant-stories
the giant was made out of pillows with a great fierce head of paper and funny clothes,bryant-stories
the little girls used to put shells in their hats for a sign they were on a pilgrimage as the old pilgrims used to do then they made journeys over the hill behind the house and through the woods and down the lanes and when the pilgrimage was over they had apples and nuts to eat in the happy land of home,bryant-stories
i cannot tell you how much louisa suffered over this,bryant-stories
it helped very much but it was so little that louisa never felt as if she were doing anything,bryant-stories
when she thought about the book she remembered the good times she used to have with her sisters in the big bare house in the country,bryant-stories
everybody bought it and much money came from it,bryant-stories
my kingdom,bryant-stories
it will help you too to think the same thoughts,bryant-stories
dear father help me with the love that casteth out my fear teach me to lean on thee and feel that thou art very near that no temptation is unseen no childish grief too small since thou with patience infinite doth soothe and comfort all,bryant-stories
did you hear what happened to piccola children dear,bryant-stories
but piccola never doubted at all that something beautiful must befall every child upon christmas day and so she slept till the dawn was gray,bryant-stories
now such a story who ever heard,bryant-stories
children this story i tell to you of piccola sweet and her bird is true,bryant-stories
one christmas day when i was grown up i found myself at a loss for the one more story called for by some little children with whom i was spending the holiday,bryant-stories
then indeed i was amused and somewhat distressed to find how far i had wandered from the text,bryant-stories
when the birds came flying into the woods and lit on the branches of the big trees and built their nests there he used to call up to them,bryant-stories
then the little fir tree looked up and called,bryant-stories
the little fir tree close down in the cover of the others would call up,bryant-stories
the worst of all was when men came into the wood with sledges and teams of horses,bryant-stories
there are none little enough they said,bryant-stories
the little fir tree was happy as a bird because he knew they were about to cut him down,bryant-stories
but always when they saw the little fir tree they shook their heads and said,bryant-stories
they took him out of his tub and carried him away between them,bryant-stories
the children took things out of the basket and began to play with the little fir tree just as he had often begged the wind and the snow and the birds to do,bryant-stories
what was it that he was now,bryant-stories
he was beginning to be lonely,bryant-stories
then the two pretty ladies took hold of the table with the little fir tree on it and pushed it very smoothly and quickly out of the doors across a hall and in at another door,bryant-stories
oh,bryant-stories
how beautiful,bryant-stories
it s the nicest christmas tree i ever saw,bryant-stories
and for love of this friend the king of egypt had let numbers of the israelites settle in his land,bryant-stories
and they gave them terrible tasks to do without proper rest or food or clothes,bryant-stories
he ordered his soldiers to kill every boy baby that should be born in an israelitish family he did not care about the girls because they could not grow up to fight,bryant-stories
somehow she contrived to keep him hidden for three whole months,bryant-stories
then she kissed her little son and left him there,bryant-stories
as the king s daughter came near to the water she saw the strange little basket lying in the flags and she sent her maid to bring it to her,bryant-stories
not a word did she say about whose child it was but perhaps the princess guessed i don t know,bryant-stories
and can you think how happy the baby s mother was,bryant-stories
and she named him moses,bryant-stories
elsa s father and mother worked very hard and became rich,bryant-stories
then then my dears came hard times for elsa,bryant-stories
and elsa would have to say i don t know,bryant-stories
little elsa cried bitterly when he was gone for she did not want to make her husband unhappy and cross and she wanted the house to look nice,bryant-stories
as she said the words a great grey man stood before her he was wrapped in a strange grey cloak that covered him from head to foot and he smiled at elsa,bryant-stories
i cannot make bread i cannot sweep i cannot sew a seam when i was a little girl i never learned to work and now i cannot do anything right,bryant-stories
these shall be your servants elsa said the grey man they are faithful and clever and they will do everything you want them to just right,bryant-stories
elsa stretched out her pretty pink fingers,bryant-stories
said the grey man,bryant-stories
elsa sat and looked with wonder at her little white hands and the ten useless fingers,bryant-stories
then the little fairy fingers seized the broom and in a twinkling they were making the house clean,bryant-stories
there was no more crossness in that house,bryant-stories
once upon a time there was an honest shoemaker who was very poor,bryant-stories
there lay a pair of shoes beautifully made and the leather was gone,bryant-stories
but when morning came two pairs of shoes lay on the bench most beautifully made and no sign of anyone who had been there,bryant-stories
it went on like this until the shoemaker and his wife were prosperous people,bryant-stories
tap,bryant-stories
then the tiny elves took hold of each other s hands and danced round the shoes on the bench till the shoemaker and his wife had hard work not to laugh aloud,bryant-stories
that very day they commenced their task,bryant-stories
promptly at midnight the little naked elves came in,bryant-stories
they never came back any more but from that day they gave the shoemaker and his wife good luck so that they never needed any more help,bryant-stories
what does this mean friend mouse deer,bryant-stories
i shall go to king solomon said the otter and you shall be punished,bryant-stories
how did it happen,bryant-stories
when the woodpecker came he said to him was it you who sounded the war gong,bryant-stories
send for the great lizard said king solomon,bryant-stories
your majesty knows said the great lizard that i am chief protector of the sword,bryant-stories
i put it on your majesty said the tortoise because i saw the king crab trailing his three edged pike,bryant-stories
immediately the crayfish was sent for,bryant-stories
and the mouse deer cannot be blamed by the law of the land,bryant-stories
and then the way her fingers go they look so quick and white in and out and to and fro and braiding in the light and it is always right,bryant-stories
do you know what a brahmin is,bryant-stories
oh brother brahmin brother brahmin said the tiger please let me out to get a little drink,bryant-stories
never in the world would i do such an ungrateful thing,bryant-stories
it is not fair or just that you should eat me when i set you free,bryant-stories
brother banyan said the brahmin eagerly does it seem to you right or just that this tiger should eat me when i set him free from his cage,bryant-stories
let the tiger eat the brahmin,bryant-stories
the brahmin went up to him and said,bryant-stories
now that i am old and weak and cannot work he leaves me without food or water to die by the wayside,bryant-stories
the tiger grumbled a good deal but at last he went on again with the brahmin,bryant-stories
the eagle soared slowly overhead a moment then he came lower and spoke in a thin clear voice,bryant-stories
the tiger sprang upon the brahmin to eat him up and this time the brahmin had very hard work to persuade him to wait,bryant-stories
the old alligator turned in the mud and grunted and snorted then he said,bryant-stories
the poor brahmin had to remind him again and again that they had asked only four,bryant-stories
after a time they met the little jackal coming gaily down the road toward them,bryant-stories
i said said the brahmin raising his voice do you think it is fair that the tiger should eat me when i set him free from his cage,bryant-stories
do you think,bryant-stories
do you think said the brahmin it is right for this tiger to eat me when i set him free from his cage,bryant-stories
but i don t altogether understand said the little jackal,bryant-stories
oh dear dear,bryant-stories
that gives me no idea at all said the little jackal,bryant-stories
now let us understand the situation said the little jackal,bryant-stories
why in the cage of course roared the tiger,bryant-stories
oh thank you thank you said the little jackal that makes it clearer but i still don t understand forgive my slow mind why did you not come out by yourself,bryant-stories
how does it shut,bryant-stories
oh does it indeed,bryant-stories
then he made a very low bow to the brahmin,bryant-stories
but you know if you don t you will when you are grown up that no matter how clever you are sooner or later you surely meet some one who is more clever,bryant-stories
now there came a time when he had eaten all the crabs to be found on his own side of the river,bryant-stories
indeed i will said the camel who was very fond of sugar cane,bryant-stories
he ate happily and noticed nothing around him,bryant-stories
of course the villagers heard him at once,bryant-stories
when they had gone leaving the poor camel half killed the little jackal came dancing back from somewhere or other,bryant-stories
you brought this upon me,bryant-stories
said the camel,bryant-stories
oh jackal,bryant-stories
my goodness don t do that,bryant-stories
so he rolled over,bryant-stories
it was a valley of brown bare desert soil in a climate where almost no rain falls but the snow on the mountain tops sent down little streams of pure water the winds were gentle and lying like a blue jewel at the foot of the western hills was a marvellous lake of salt water an inland sea,bryant-stories
every one helped and every one watched for the sprouting with hopes and prayers and careful eyes,bryant-stories
one day the men who were watering the crops saw a great number of crickets swarming over the ground at the edge of the gardens nearest the mountains,bryant-stories
then they ran and told the terrible news and all the village came to help,bryant-stories
others gathered round and joined them weeping,bryant-stories
some of the people looked up startled,bryant-stories
was the cry,bryant-stories
woe,bryant-stories
no no,bryant-stories
the gulls devoured the crickets in dozens in hundreds in swarms,bryant-stories
the nightingale,bryant-stories
people came from all over the world to see the crystal palace and the wonderful garden and the great forest but when they went home and wrote books about these things they always wrote but the nightingale is the best of all,bryant-stories
the chamberlain who was a very important person said there cannot be any such person i have never heard his name,bryant-stories
the book says there is a nightingale said the emperor if the nightingale is not here to sing for me this evening i will have the court trampled upon immediately after supper,bryant-stories
when they had gone a little way they heard a cow moo,bryant-stories
surely that is the nightingale said the courtiers it really sounds like church bells,bryant-stories
and sure enough the little nightingale began to sing,bryant-stories
the little nightingale said she could sing better in her own greenwood but she was so sweet and kind that she came with them,bryant-stories
and my dears she sang so beautifully that the emperor s eyes filled up with tears,bryant-stories
she was to have a golden perch near the emperor s bed and a little golden cage and was to be allowed to go out twice every day,bryant-stories
at last one day there came a little package to the emperor on the outside of which was written the nightingale,bryant-stories
they would have made it sing the tune thirty four times but the emperor said i should like to hear the real nightingale sing now,bryant-stories
but it does not matter the new nightingale is just as good,bryant-stories
then he ran to his clock maker but he could not do much,bryant-stories
when it was sure that he could not live much longer the people chose a new emperor and waited for the old one to die,bryant-stories
death had put on the emperor s gold crown and he had the gold sceptre in one hand and the silken banner in the other and he looked at the emperor with his great hollow eyes,bryant-stories
they whispered you remember this you remember that the emperor remembered so much that he cried out loud oh bring the great drum,bryant-stories
but there was nobody to wind the little gold nightingale up and of course it could not sing,bryant-stories
death was listening to the song too and when it was done and the emperor begged for more death too said please sing again little nightingale,bryant-stories
will you give me the emperor s sceptre for another song,bryant-stories
and he rose from the emperor s heart and floated away through the window,bryant-stories
but every night when you are quite alone i will come and sit in the window and sing to you and tell you everything that goes on in your kingdom i will tell you where the poor people are who ought to be helped and where the wicked people are who ought to be punished,bryant-stories
there was once a little girl named margery who had always lived in the city,bryant-stories
margery was delighted,bryant-stories
behind the cottage were apple trees a plum tree and two or three pear trees then came a stretch of rough grass and then a stone wall with a gate leading into the fields,bryant-stories
flowers said margery with shining eyes blue and white and yellow and pink every kind of flower,bryant-stories
oh,bryant-stories
the outside strip is for flowers said margery s father and next is a footpath all the way round the beds that is to let you get at the flowers to weed and to pick there is a wider path through the middle and the rest is for rows of salad vegetables,bryant-stories
i wouldn t take care of it for anything,bryant-stories
two evenings after that when margery was called in from her first ramble in the fields she found the postman at the door,bryant-stories
margery could hardly wait to open it,bryant-stories
she did not know that a helianthus was a sunflower until her mother told her so and she had never seen the dear blue bell shaped flowers that always grow in old fashioned gardens and are called canterbury bells,bryant-stories
you know dear the ground has to be made ready first it takes a little time it may be several days before you can plant,bryant-stories
i suppose you have seen ploughs but margery never had and she watched with great interest while the man and her father took the plough from the cart and harnessed the horses to it,bryant-stories
margery wondered what in the world he meant it had not been cultivated of course but what had that do with the kind of plough,bryant-stories
he drove the sharp end of the plough into the soil and held it firmly so while the horses drew it along in a straight line,bryant-stories
when he had ploughed the man went back to his cart and unloaded another farm implement,bryant-stories
the man s weight kept the harrow steady and let the teeth of the rake scratch and cut the ground up so that it did not stay in ridges,bryant-stories
illustration,bryant-stories
that would not have had to be done if the land had been ploughed in the autumn the grass would have rotted in the ground and would have made food for the plants,bryant-stories
then he took the cord to the other end of the garden and pulled it tight tied it to another stake and drove that down,bryant-stories
margery ran and brought the seed box,bryant-stories
her father took a handful of peas and stooping walked slowly along the line letting the seed trickle through his fingers,bryant-stories
and margery s father made a row of holes after that for the tomato plants,bryant-stories
then you rake very gently over the surface with the back of a rake to even it all off,bryant-stories
he was not going to have any such thing for his two little girls as he called them,bryant-stories
the little footpaths were marked out by father brown s feet margery and her mother laughed well at his actions for it looked like some kind of dance,bryant-stories
for some her father poked little holes with his finger for some he made very shallow trenches and some very small seeds were scattered lightly over the top of the ground,bryant-stories
canariensis is a pretty creeper with golden blossoms very dainty and bright,bryant-stories
they were so tiny that it did not seem possible that green lettuce leaves could come from them,bryant-stories
i have a garden,bryant-stories
the next morning after the garden was planted margery was up and out at six o clock,bryant-stories
quickly she knelt down on the footpath to see,bryant-stories
the little leaves no bigger than half your little finger nail grew in twos two on each tiny stem they were almost round,bryant-stories
could it be weeds,bryant-stories
the more she looked at them the more it seemed to margery that they looked exactly as the radish looked when it first came up,bryant-stories
in irregular patches on the row hints of green were coming,bryant-stories
can we have made a mistake,bryant-stories
she ran to the house and found her father,bryant-stories
what makes you think such a thing,bryant-stories
many of the dicotyledonous plants look alike at the beginning he said with a little drawl on the big word,bryant-stories
that evening margery was waiting eagerly for him,bryant-stories
these two lie folded up in the little seed from the beginning and are full of plant food,bryant-stories
many of the dicotyledons look alike,bryant-stories
but it does at first it looks so much like these things that in the great nurseries where trees are raised for forests and parks the workmen have to be very carefully trained or else they would pull up the trees when they are weeding,bryant-stories
i am glad to know that father said margery soberly,bryant-stories
the talkative tortoise,bryant-stories
the two ducks saw that they could no longer live there so they decided to fly to another region where there was more water,bryant-stories
but you cannot fly,bryant-stories
said the tortoise,bryant-stories
if you open your mouth you are lost,bryant-stories
but she remembered and kept still,bryant-stories
they shouted and every one ran to look,bryant-stories
look,bryant-stories
robert of sicily,bryant-stories
he turned to a learned clerk at his side and asked what those words meant for he knew no latin,bryant-stories
presently the king fell asleep while the service went on,bryant-stories
the old sexton heard some one shouting and pounding in the church and thought it was some drunken vagabond who had stolen in during the service,bryant-stories
came a hoarse angry voice from within,bryant-stories
in his fluttering rags without hat or cloak not knowing what strange thing had happened to him king robert rushed to his palace gates pushed aside the startled servants and hurried blind with rage up the wide stair and through the great corridors toward the room where he could hear the sound of his courtiers voices,bryant-stories
he was dressed in the king s royal robes he wore the royal crown and on his hand was the king s own ring,bryant-stories
and though his voice was just like robert s own it had something in it sweet and deep like the sound of bells,bryant-stories
they would have killed the crazy man who insulted their king but he raised his hand and stopped them and with his eyes looking into robert s eyes he said not the king you shall be the king s jester,bryant-stories
and when he woke next morning he believed it was a dream and that he was king again,bryant-stories
robert was still the jester and his heart grew harder and more bitter with every year,bryant-stories
at the end of three years the pope called the emperor of allemaine and the king of sicily his brothers to a great meeting in his city of rome,bryant-stories
every one in the villages through which they passed ran after the jester and pointed and laughed,bryant-stories
he cried i am your brother robert of sicily,bryant-stories
it was holy week and the king and the emperor with all their trains went every day to the great services in the cathedral,bryant-stories
and when easter day came never had there been so lovely so holy a day in the great churches filled with flowers and sweet with incense the kneeling people listened to the choirs singing and it was like the voices of angels their prayers were more earnest than ever before their praise more glad there was something heavenly in rome,bryant-stories
he thought of god and of his own wickedness he remembered how selfish he had been and how little good he had done he realised that his power had not been from himself at all,bryant-stories
the sound of their singing came softly in at the palace windows,bryant-stories
thou knowest best he said i only know that i have sinned,bryant-stories
then robert of sicily was alone,bryant-stories
i wonder if you have ever heard the anecdote about the artist of duesseldorf and the jealous courtiers,bryant-stories
at last the work was done and the artist had the great statue set up in the public square of duesseldorf ready for the opening view,bryant-stories
herr grupello he said you are a great artist and this statue will make your fame even greater than it is the portrait of me is perfect,bryant-stories
no said another the horse is really not so successful the turn of the neck there is awkward,bryant-stories
the elector assented and the artist ordered a temporary screen to be built around the statue so that his assistants could work undisturbed,bryant-stories
again the elector exclaimed at its beauty and then he turned to his courtiers one after another to see what they had to say,bryant-stories
the rear right foot is as it should be now said a third and it adds so much to the beauty of the whole,bryant-stories
what do you mean,bryant-stories
and i rather think that their reputation is pretty well hammered to pieces,bryant-stories
surely you know it said the good king it is for my only son prince cherry do for him whatever you would have done for me,bryant-stories
of what use will it be to him to be beautiful rich or powerful if he grows into a bad man,bryant-stories
and when he died soon after he was happy to know that he left prince cherry in her hands,bryant-stories
i am the fairy candide she said to the prince,bryant-stories
if you do not heed its warnings a worse thing will happen to you for i shall become your enemy,bryant-stories
now after a while he began to find out that this was not true and it made him angry,bryant-stories
when he reached the palace his pet dog ran to meet him,bryant-stories
at the instant he felt a sharp prick in his little finger like a pin prick,bryant-stories
what evil is there in that,bryant-stories
he treated his people carelessly and his servants cruelly and everything he wanted he felt that he must have,bryant-stories
finally he wanted something that he really could not have,bryant-stories
you are very handsome very charming prince said zelia but you are not like the good king your father i fear you would make me very miserable if i were your queen,bryant-stories
may you not do as you will,bryant-stories
said the courtier,bryant-stories
the only person who could have dared to help her thought the prince was his old tutor suliman the only man left who ever rebuked him for anything,bryant-stories
with horror the prince felt himself being transformed into a monster,bryant-stories
and as he gazed in horror the fairy s voice whispered your soul has become more ugly than your shape is you yourself have deformed it,bryant-stories
even as he heard this the prince saw suliman on the steps of the palace speaking to the people,bryant-stories
when the beast heard this it touched him so much that he stopped tearing at his chains and became gentle,bryant-stories
good enough,bryant-stories
as he crouched at the keeper s feet a voice said good actions never go unrewarded,bryant-stories
one day he had carried his crust of bread to a retired spot in the palace woods where he loved to be when he saw a poor old woman hunting for roots and seeming almost starved,bryant-stories
oh how he wished he were the monster once more so that he could kill the men and rescue her,bryant-stories
but suddenly he thought i was as bad as these men i myself put zelia in prison and would have treated her worse still if i had not been prevented,bryant-stories
at the same moment a voice said good actions never go unrewarded,bryant-stories
he wanted more than anything else to find her and stay near her so he flew out into the world to seek her,bryant-stories
said zelia,bryant-stories
at that instant the white dove vanished and prince cherry stood there as handsome and charming as ever and with a look of kindness and modesty in his eyes which had never been there before,bryant-stories
in a trice they were transported to the prince s palace where king suliman greeted them with tears of joy,bryant-stories
he was very industrious and the farm always prospered under his care,bryant-stories
after the farmer was dead the sons went to work to find the pot of gold since they did not know where the hiding place was they agreed to begin in a line at one end of the orchard and to dig until one of them should find the money,bryant-stories
the next olive season the olive trees in the orchard bore more fruit than they had ever given before the fine cultivating they had had from the digging brought so much fruit and of so fine a quality that when it was sold it gave the sons a whole pot of gold,bryant-stories
the woman is not at all pretty she wears thick common shoes a plain dress with a little shawl and a sun bonnet she is stout and short and her face is a square chinned irish face but her eyes look at you like your mother s,bryant-stories
her whole name was margaret haughery but no one in new orleans remembers her by it any more than you think of your dearest sister by her full name she is just margaret,bryant-stories
but very soon her husband died and then the baby died too and margaret was all alone in the world,bryant-stories
they needed a good friend now,bryant-stories
with this she bought two cows and a little delivery cart,bryant-stories
with this she built a home for orphan babies she called it her baby house,bryant-stories
in all the trouble and sickness and fear of that time margaret drove her cart of bread and somehow she had always enough to give the starving soldiers and for her babies beside what she sold,bryant-stories
then by and by one day margaret died,bryant-stories
so they made a statue of her just as she used to look sitting in her own office door or driving in her own little cart,bryant-stories
it is so old that even as long ago as four thousand years it had people who dug in the mines and knew how to weave cloth and to make beautiful ornaments out of gold and who could fight and make laws but we do not know just where they came from nor exactly how they lived,bryant-stories
the golden haired people had a great chieftain who was also a kind of high priest who was called the dagda,bryant-stories
then the song would swell out louder and every warrior would remember only the glory he had helped win for the king and each man would rise at the great table his cup in his hand and shout long live the king,bryant-stories
and while they were in the midst of their banqueting the door was suddenly burst open and the dagda stood there with his men,bryant-stories
the harp answered with the magic music of tears,bryant-stories
and now a music stole forth as soft as dreams and as sweet as joy it was the magic music of sleep,bryant-stories
he had not gone far when he met a white horse and he saluted him,bryant-stories
for it seems the king had promised his daughter and a great lot of money to anyone who should be able to build up his court,bryant-stories
he brought his spade and shovel and he made a hole and he asked the old white horse to go down into it so that he could see if it would fit him,bryant-stories
god save you said the fox,bryant-stories
would you make a place for me where i can hide,bryant-stories
the fox went into it and when the tailor had him down he shut him in,bryant-stories
god save you said the tailor,bryant-stories
i ll do that for you said the tailor,bryant-stories
the tailor said he would not loose him until he came back himself,bryant-stories
the workpeople then went home and the tailor went in hiding behind the big stone,bryant-stories
they did that for him went home and the tailor went in hiding the same as he did the evening before,bryant-stories
the tailor went then till he came to the place where the other giant was and asked did he want a servant boy,bryant-stories
the tailor went out then and he got a sheepskin which he sewed up until he made a bag of it and he slipped it down under his coat,bryant-stories
the giant drank another gallon then and the tailor let another gallon down into the skin but the giant thought he was drinking it,bryant-stories
do it yourself first said the giant,bryant-stories
he went to the king then and desired him to send him out his wife and his money saying that he would throw down the court again if he did not do so immediately,bryant-stories
when they heard that they released the lion,bryant-stories
when the tailor saw them coming he got out of the coach with his wife and he sat down on the ground,bryant-stories
no,bryant-stories
how the sea became salt,bryant-stories
,bryant-stories
so king frode sent messengers over the world to find for him two servants who would be strong enough to grind with the millstones and after a long long time his messengers found him two maid servants who were bigger and stronger than anyone in denmark had ever seen,bryant-stories
presently frode came into the mill to see that the new servants were performing their task diligently,bryant-stories
they had been grinding out wealth and happiness and peace but now they bade the magic stones to grind something very different,bryant-stories
no longer will frode sit on his throne and rule over rings of red gold and mighty millstones,bryant-stories
and the whole world shook and trembled with the mighty shock of that breaking,bryant-stories
and he bade them begin at once to grind salt for of this he had very scanty store,bryant-stories
and that is how the sea became salt,bryant-stories
it was a wonderful and beautiful castle all glistening towers that gleamed like marble and glancing windows that shone like crystal,bryant-stories
as she passed the travellers she turned her face to them and smiled,bryant-stories
he said,bryant-stories
you may reach it to day if you will there is time if you waste none,bryant-stories
the idea,bryant-stories
the lazy man lay down in the soft grass and looked rather wistfully at the far away towers,bryant-stories
it was a dainty creature gentle looking and finely built and it was saddled and bridled,bryant-stories
the little horse started at a fine pace and in a very few minutes they overtook the other traveller plodding along on foot,bryant-stories
exactly at noon the horse turned aside from the road into a shady grove on a hill and stopped,bryant-stories
then he felt drowsy from the heat and the early ride so he pulled his hat over his eyes and settled himself for a nap,bryant-stories
everything he wanted was brought to him and music played while fireworks were set off in his honour,bryant-stories
the only living thing near was an old bony grey donkey,bryant-stories
then came trouble,bryant-stories
there he lay groaning for many minutes for it was not a soft place i can assure you,bryant-stories
the lazy man crept round and round the spot where he had fallen scratched his hands on the stumps tore his face in the briers and bumped his knees on the stones,bryant-stories
the beast he took hold of seemed very small and as he mounted he felt that its sides were moist and slimy,bryant-stories
but even the donkey was not so slow as this the new steed was slower than he,bryant-stories
a cold shudder ran over the lazy man s body and he would have got off his horrid animal then and there but just then the clock struck once more,bryant-stories
the clock struck twice,bryant-stories
and as it struck the third note something came rustling and rattling out of the darkness something that sounded like a horse with harness,bryant-stories
and the clock struck nine,bryant-stories
backward went the crab,bryant-stories
what became of him and his crab no one knows to this day and no one cares,bryant-stories
he was good to look upon for he had fair hair and a ruddy skin and he was very strong and brave and modest,bryant-stories
david s three older brothers went but he was only a boy so he was left behind to care for the sheep,bryant-stories
david came to the place where the israelites were just as the host was going forth to the fight shouting for the battle,bryant-stories
who is that,bryant-stories
what,bryant-stories
choose you a man and let him come down to me,bryant-stories
they were saying have ye seen this man that is come up,bryant-stories
and he was stirred with anger,bryant-stories
then david said to saul once i was keeping my father s sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and i went out after the lion and struck him and delivered the lamb out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by the beard and struck him and slew him,bryant-stories
but when david girded his sword upon his armour and tried to walk he said to saul i cannot go with these for i am not used to them,bryant-stories
and he said to david am i a dog that thou comest to me with a cudgel,bryant-stories
and then when the philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet david david made haste and ran toward the army to meet the philistine,bryant-stories
and after the battle david was taken to the king s tent and made a captain over many men and he went no more to his father s house to herd the sheep but became a man in the king s service,bryant-stories
but when king saul died the people chose david for their king because there was no one so brave so wise or so faithful to god,bryant-stories
often after david had made a song his chief musician would sing with him as the people gathered to worship god,bryant-stories
it is a beautiful song i wish we knew the music that david made for it but we only know his words,bryant-stories
yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me,bryant-stories
he lived high up on the mountainside in a tiny cave his food was roots and acorns a bit of bread given by a peasant or a cheese brought by a woman who wanted his prayers his work was praying and thinking about god,bryant-stories
whose soul in the heavenly grace had grown to the selfsame measure as his own whose treasure on the celestial shore could neither be less than his nor more,bryant-stories
when the angel had faded from sight the hermit bowed his head again but this time with great sorrow and fear,bryant-stories
there was the clown doing his silly tricks for the crowd,bryant-stories
so after a little he asked the clown very gently what his life was what it had been,bryant-stories
yes holy father he said i have been something else,bryant-stories
was this how he looked to the heavenly father like a thief a cruel mountain robber,bryant-stories
pleaded the hermit,bryant-stories
father when her eyes met mine something pierced my heart,bryant-stories
i cut her bonds with my knife and she looked at me to show that she trusted,bryant-stories
i could not go back to the old bad life and i had never learned an honest way to earn my bread,bryant-stories
god has remembered your soul is in his sight even as mine who have prayed and preached for forty years,bryant-stories
but when the hermit told him the story of his prayer and the angel s answer the poor clown was transfigured with joy for he knew that his sins were forgiven,bryant-stories
for ten years more the hermit lived in his mountain hut thinking always of god fasting and praying and doing no least thing that was wrong,bryant-stories
in them he should find two souls like his own in god s sight,bryant-stories
one was old and the other of middle age,bryant-stories
to be sure twice every year when they killed a sheep for food they gave half to their poorer neighbours,bryant-stories
said the hermit,bryant-stories
some serve him in churches and in hermits cells by praise and prayer some poor souls who have been very wicked turn from their wickedness with sorrow and serve him with repentance some live faithfully and gently in humble homes working bringing up children keeping kind and cheerful some bear pain patiently for his sake,bryant-stories
across the north sea in a country called germany lived a little boy named gottlieb,bryant-stories
the little boy had grown quick to read these signs of distress and he thought christmas will be here soon and dear mother is thinking of what a sad time it will be,bryant-stories
but then came the thought he will never find us,bryant-stories
perhaps the burgomaster would know the right thing to do,bryant-stories
but others were up before him for to his surprise he saw a strange gentleman with his mother,bryant-stories
then he turned to gottlieb with a smile you see that although you wrote to the christ child your prayer for aid came only to the burgomaster,bryant-stories
the dark green fir looks so majestic when laden with bright toys and lit up by christmas candles that perhaps it is not easy to believe that it is the most modest of trees,bryant-stories
every day people came to see the sweet babe bringing presents in their hands,bryant-stories
asked the fir,bryant-stories
this made the poor fir very unhappy indeed and it said sadly yes you are right,bryant-stories
this they were glad to do and their silvery light shone among the branches just like christmas candles,bryant-stories
the diamond and the dewdrop,bryant-stories
at last a large beetle during his rambles chanced to espy the diamond and he also recognised him to be some one of great rank and importance,bryant-stories
he remarked affably waving one of his feelers in the direction of the dewdrop,bryant-stories
away sir pass on,bryant-stories
beau ty,bryant-stories
there is no apart from rank and wealth,bryant-stories
slowly a bright tear fell and splashed the dust,bryant-stories
my throat is parched for want of water,bryant-stories
deeply did he repent his foolish wish,bryant-stories
oh my precious precious friend if you will you can save my life,bryant-stories
i ve been taught a lesson that i shall not easily forget,bryant-stories
buster bear goes fishing,burgess-busterbrown
while he sat there trying to make up his mind what would taste best he was listening to the sounds that told of the waking of all the little people who live in the green forest,burgess-busterbrown
probably he is the thief himself,burgess-busterbrown
but most of all he listened to a merry low silvery laugh that never stopped but went on and on until he just felt as if he must laugh too,burgess-busterbrown
i want some fat trout for my breakfast,burgess-busterbrown
why little joe otter to be sure,burgess-busterbrown
buster bear tiptoed up very softly until he was right behind little joe otter,burgess-busterbrown
little joe otter gave a frightened squeal and without even turning to see who was speaking dropped his fish and dived headfirst into the laughing brook,burgess-busterbrown
illustration here s your trout mr,burgess-busterbrown
he snarled at buster bear and called him a thief and everything bad he could think of,burgess-busterbrown
i wonder what i d better do with it,burgess-busterbrown
little joe otter was in a terrible rage,burgess-busterbrown
i was sitting on the bank of the laughing brook beside one of the little pools he told billy mink and was just going to eat a fat trout i had caught when who should come along but that great big bully buster bear,burgess-busterbrown
buster bear hadn t actually taken the fish away from little joe,burgess-busterbrown
he s somewhere up the laughing brook,burgess-busterbrown
there wasn t water enough in it anywhere except down in the smiling pool and that was on the green meadows where buster had never been known to go,burgess-busterbrown
there he is,burgess-busterbrown
he s fishing,burgess-busterbrown
said little joe fiercely,burgess-busterbrown
i m going to drive all the fish out of the little pools and muddy the water all up,burgess-busterbrown
then he stirred up the mud until the water was so dirty that buster couldn t have seen a fish right under his nose,burgess-busterbrown
buster bear hadn t enjoyed himself so much since he came to the green forest to live,burgess-busterbrown
he stole up to it very very softly so as not to frighten the fish,burgess-busterbrown
perhaps that is what the fish thought he was for pretty soon two or three swam right in close to where he was sitting,burgess-busterbrown
at the next little pool the same thing happened,burgess-busterbrown
but it takes more than three trout to fill buster bear s stomach so he kept on to the next little pool,burgess-busterbrown
it s of no use to try to fish here,burgess-busterbrown
then he went on to another and this was no better,burgess-busterbrown
everything was still save for the laughter of the laughing brook,burgess-busterbrown
it s lucky i caught what i did,burgess-busterbrown
and then because buster bear always enjoys a good joke even when it is on himself he laughed until he had to hold his sides which is a whole lot better than going off in a rage as little joe otter had done,burgess-busterbrown
little joe otter supplies buster bear with a breakfast,burgess-busterbrown
oh my no,burgess-busterbrown
to be sure bobby coon caught a few little fish there but they didn t mind bobby,burgess-busterbrown
i ll keep watch and as soon as i see him coming i ll drive out all the fish just as i did to day,burgess-busterbrown
then he hurried down to the next little pool and did the same thing,burgess-busterbrown
things happened just as he had expected,burgess-busterbrown
then he saved a nice fat trout and waited,burgess-busterbrown
i hope we ll go fishing together often,burgess-busterbrown
v,burgess-busterbrown
that is the way with grandfather frog,burgess-busterbrown
billy mink stopped long enough to eat the fat fish buster had left on the bank and then he too went down to the smiling pool,burgess-busterbrown
so did jerry muskrat who had been listening,burgess-busterbrown
chug a rum,burgess-busterbrown
they were no more your fish than mine protested billy mink,burgess-busterbrown
grandfather frog looked up at jolly round bright mr sun and slowly winked one of his great goggly eyes,burgess-busterbrown
what have foolish green flies got to do with my i mean fish,burgess-busterbrown
of course not,burgess-busterbrown
little joe couldn t find a word to say,burgess-busterbrown
vi,burgess-busterbrown
no one ever likes to admit being afraid least of all little joe otter,burgess-busterbrown
it is apt to make one selfish and thoughtless of other people and very hard to get along with,burgess-busterbrown
too bad,burgess-busterbrown
it tickled him so that he had hard work to keep a straight face,burgess-busterbrown
it was a little sheepish grin at first but at last it grew into a laugh,burgess-busterbrown
but he didn t take so much as one bite,burgess-busterbrown
once he nearly lost the fish,burgess-busterbrown
little joe sprang at him angrily but shadow was too quick and darted away,burgess-busterbrown
one of the merry little breezes had carried the scent of that fat trout over to him,burgess-busterbrown
thank you replied buster and his eyes twinkled more than ever,burgess-busterbrown
farmer brown s boy tramped through the green forest whistling merrily,burgess-busterbrown
so he whistled as he tramped along and his whistle was good to hear,burgess-busterbrown
either the trout have lost their appetite or they have grown very wise muttered farmer brown s boy as after a long time he moved on to the next little pool,burgess-busterbrown
he didn t know what to make of it,burgess-busterbrown
what s this,burgess-busterbrown
then he picked up one of the little heads and looked at it sharply,burgess-busterbrown
this puzzled him more than ever,burgess-busterbrown
it made him feel very queer,burgess-busterbrown
twas just a sudden odd surprise made farmer brown s boy s hair to rise,burgess-busterbrown
both anger and fear make it do that,burgess-busterbrown
you see when he had found the heads of those trout on the bank he knew right away that some one else had been fishing and that was why he couldn t catch any but it didn t seem possible that little billy mink could have eaten all those trout and farmer brown s boy didn t once think of little joe otter and so he was very very much puzzled,burgess-busterbrown
why it was a footprint in the soft mud,burgess-busterbrown
he never had heard of a bear being in the green forest,burgess-busterbrown
he had a funny feeling too that he was being watched although he couldn t see any one,burgess-busterbrown
huh,burgess-busterbrown
little joe otter was fairly bursting with excitement,burgess-busterbrown
sure enough peter rabbit was there on one side of the smiling pool making faces at reddy fox who was on the other side which of course was not at all nice of peter,burgess-busterbrown
cried billy mink,burgess-busterbrown
i don t believe anybody can be smarter than buster bear,burgess-busterbrown
he snapped,burgess-busterbrown
reddy glared across the smiling pool at peter,burgess-busterbrown
taunted peter,burgess-busterbrown
it s news great news,burgess-busterbrown
for a minute no one said a word,burgess-busterbrown
we are all afraid of him,burgess-busterbrown
now tell me that he isn t afraid,burgess-busterbrown
i ll believe it when i see it for myself,burgess-busterbrown
of course peter rabbit helped spread it,burgess-busterbrown
a few doubted little joe s story,burgess-busterbrown
you see he was jealous of buster bear and at the same time he was afraid of him,burgess-busterbrown
so now they were very proud to think that one of their own number actually had frightened him and they began to look on buster bear as a real hero,burgess-busterbrown
ah wish brer bear would go up to farmer brown s henhouse and scare farmer brown s boy so that he would keep away from there,burgess-busterbrown
we ll do it right away,burgess-busterbrown
snapped little joe otter,burgess-busterbrown
perhaps he didn t know whose it was and if he had he wouldn t have been afraid,burgess-busterbrown
that s telling said he,burgess-busterbrown
blacky is a dreamer,burgess-busterbrown
he is one of the smartest and cleverest of all the little people of the green meadows and the green forest and all the others know it,burgess-busterbrown
so now as he sat in the top of the big hickory tree beside the smiling pool and looked down on all the little people gathered there he was very happy,burgess-busterbrown
on another lily pad sat spotty the turtle,burgess-busterbrown
then he cleared his throat very loudly and began to speak,burgess-busterbrown
perhaps he was and then again perhaps he wasn t,burgess-busterbrown
to morrow morning very early sammy jay and i will make a great fuss near the edge of the green forest,burgess-busterbrown
now what do you say,burgess-busterbrown
xii,burgess-busterbrown
meanwhile sammy jay was slipping silently through the green forest looking for buster bear so that when the time came he could let his cousin blacky the crow know just where buster was,burgess-busterbrown
shouted blacky,burgess-busterbrown
blacky didn t know what to make of it,burgess-busterbrown
now all this time the other little people of the green forest and the green meadows had been hiding where they could see all that went on,burgess-busterbrown
he shouted,burgess-busterbrown
it seemed as if farmer brown s boy never would come out but at last he did,burgess-busterbrown
he had heard the screaming of blacky the crow and sammy jay and he had listened until he couldn t stand it another minute,burgess-busterbrown
xiii,burgess-busterbrown
when farmer brown s boy came hurrying home from the laughing brook without any fish one day and told about the great footprint he had seen in a muddy place on the bank deep in the green forest and had said his was sure that it was the footprint of a bear he had been laughed at,burgess-busterbrown
i think you must have imagined it,burgess-busterbrown
when blacky and sammy saw him coming they moved a little farther in to the green forest still screaming in the most excited way,burgess-busterbrown
you see they had come to believe that farmer brown s boy wasn t afraid of anybody or anything and as most of them were very much afraid of him they had hard work to believe that he would really be afraid of even such a great big strong fellow as buster bear,burgess-busterbrown
then everybody held their breath even blacky the crow and sammy jay,burgess-busterbrown
blacky the crow and sammy jay looking down from the top of a tall tree held their breath,burgess-busterbrown
peter rabbit sitting bolt upright under a thick hemlock branch with eyes and ears wide open held breath,burgess-busterbrown
then something happened,burgess-busterbrown
there was no doubt about it for with the yell farmer brown s boy turned and ran for home as no one ever had seen him run before,burgess-busterbrown
what did i tell you,burgess-busterbrown
see him go,burgess-busterbrown
what do you think they saw,burgess-busterbrown
page,burgess-busterbrown
unc billy possum chuckled,burgess-busterbrown
xv,burgess-busterbrown
at least some of them had,burgess-busterbrown
and right away everybody lost a great deal of the respect for buster which they had felt,burgess-busterbrown
they delighted in flying about through the green forest until they had found buster bear and then from the safety of the tree tops screaming at him,burgess-busterbrown
he just had to stand it and do nothing,burgess-busterbrown
but buster is a splendid climber especially when the tree is big and stout as this one was and now he went up after chatterer growling angrily,burgess-busterbrown
and there was no one to help him,burgess-busterbrown
but once in a while a great fear takes possession of him as when he knows that shadow the weasel is looking for him,burgess-busterbrown
if only he had known that buster could climb a tree,burgess-busterbrown
nearer and nearer came buster bear and deeper and angrier sounded his voice,burgess-busterbrown
if only he had wings like sammy jay,burgess-busterbrown
i ll teach you to treat your betters with respect,burgess-busterbrown
gr r r r,burgess-busterbrown
cried chatterer and ran out to the very tip of the little branch to which he had been clinging,burgess-busterbrown
but chatterer had learned from old mother nature that she had given him certain things to help him at just such times and one of them is the power to spread himself very flat,burgess-busterbrown
it helped him keep his balance and keep from turning over and over,burgess-busterbrown
i didn t catch him that time he growled but i guess i gave him a good fright and taught him a lesson,burgess-busterbrown
however it isn t a bad habit unless it is carried too far,burgess-busterbrown
then there wouldn t be any secret,burgess-busterbrown
that is one thing about habits you always take them with you wherever you go,burgess-busterbrown
i need a change,burgess-busterbrown
i know,burgess-busterbrown
now if i were back up there in the great woods i could have all i could eat,burgess-busterbrown
if i wasn t afraid that some one would see me i d go up there,burgess-busterbrown
he wandered about uneasily,burgess-busterbrown
he licked his lips hungrily as he spoke,burgess-busterbrown
that s just what i ll do,burgess-busterbrown
i have an idea that something interesting may happen if buster doesn t change his mind,burgess-busterbrown
sammy waited a little until he could see better,burgess-busterbrown
that is just what happened the day that buster bear first thought of going berrying,burgess-busterbrown
he was awake even before jolly round red mr sun thought it was time to get up and he was all ready to start for the old pasture when the first jolly little sunbeams came dancing across the green meadows,burgess-busterbrown
you see the bushes grow very thick there and you cannot see very far in any direction,burgess-busterbrown
so he didn t whistle as he felt like doing and he tried not to make a bit of noise as he followed an old cow path towards a place where he knew the berries grew thick and oh so big and all the time he kept his eyes wide open and he kept his ears open too,burgess-busterbrown
at first he couldn t make out just what it was or where it came from,burgess-busterbrown
help and it was very faint and sounded terribly frightened,burgess-busterbrown
of course farmer brown s boy didn t let him,burgess-busterbrown
to be sure he wasn t in the green forest now but he wasn t far from it,burgess-busterbrown
nothing can quite equal honey in buster s mind,burgess-busterbrown
he mumbled in his deep grumbly rumbly voice as he sat on his haunches stripping off the berries greedily,burgess-busterbrown
now buster had reached the old pasture just as jolly round red mr sun had crept out of bed and he had fully made up his mind that he would be back in the green forest before mr sun had climbed very far up in the blue blue sky,burgess-busterbrown
but when he found those berries he was so hungry that he forgot his fears and everything else,burgess-busterbrown
so he wandered from one patch of berries to another in the old pasture and never once thought of the time,burgess-busterbrown
and he saw something else in the old pasture that made his smile still broader,burgess-busterbrown
there were no leaves or green ones there,burgess-busterbrown
it seemed perfectly harmless,burgess-busterbrown
he would eat those berries to the last one and then he would go home to the green forest,burgess-busterbrown
there is no doubt that he stole the berries that were in the pail when he found it for he deliberately ate them,burgess-busterbrown
in fact he didn t want that pail at all,burgess-busterbrown
and that is just what he did do,burgess-busterbrown
this was bad enough but to make matters worse just at that very minute he heard a shrill angry voice shout hi there,burgess-busterbrown
there was that awful pail fast over his head so that he couldn t see a thing,burgess-busterbrown
he tried to pull it off but somehow he couldn t get hold of it,burgess-busterbrown
in fact he was too surprised and frightened even to run,burgess-busterbrown
he started for the green forest as fast as his legs could take him and this was very fast indeed let me tell you,burgess-busterbrown
he didn t want it,burgess-busterbrown
xxi,burgess-busterbrown
never had he screamed so loud and never had his voice sounded so excited,burgess-busterbrown
he was so surprised that he almost forgot to keep his wings moving,burgess-busterbrown
at the top of his lungs and behind him blacky the crow trying to catch up and yelling as loud as he could caw caw caw,burgess-busterbrown
it was bad enough to be frightened almost to death as he had been up in the old pasture when the pail had caught over his head just as farmer brown s boy had yelled at him,burgess-busterbrown
yes sir buster felt that he was shamed in the eyes of his neighbors and he wanted nothing so much as to get away by himself where no one could see him and try to get rid of that dreadful pail,burgess-busterbrown
they actually flew into the very tree under which he was hiding and how they did scream,burgess-busterbrown
presently buster heard light footsteps and peeping out he saw billy mink and peter rabbit and jumper the hare and prickly porky and reddy fox and jimmy skunk,burgess-busterbrown
screamed sammy until his throat was sore,burgess-busterbrown
buster bear has a fit of temper,burgess-busterbrown
and the worst part of it all was that all his neighbors of the green forest and a whole lot from the green meadows and the smiling pool were also there to see it,burgess-busterbrown
but when his temper is aroused and gets away from him then watch out,burgess-busterbrown
but to have sammy jay call everybody within hearing to come and see him was more than he could stand,burgess-busterbrown
he roared with all his might,burgess-busterbrown
a few who could neither fly nor climb nor run fast hid and lay shaking and trembling for fear that buster would find them,burgess-busterbrown
112,burgess-busterbrown
he shook himself,burgess-busterbrown
then and not till then did buster recover his usual good nature,burgess-busterbrown
you ought to know by this time that no good comes of stealing,burgess-busterbrown
screamed sammy and flew away,burgess-busterbrown
you see farmer brown s boy is learning to be something of a philosopher one of those people who accept bad things cheerfully and right away see how they are better than they might have been,burgess-busterbrown
then he had seen buster tear away through the brush even more frightened than he was and right away his courage had begun to come back,burgess-busterbrown
he walked over to the place where the pail had been and then he remembered that when buster ran away he had carried the pail with him hanging about his neck,burgess-busterbrown
then he began to laugh as he thought of how funny buster bear had looked with the pail about his neck and then because you know he is learning to be a philosopher he once more repeated it might have been worse,burgess-busterbrown
chuckling happily over buster bear s great fright farmer brown s boy tramped back to the spring where he had left two thick sandwiches on a flat stone when he started to save his pail of berries,burgess-busterbrown
this he exclaimed right out loud for he had just come in sight of the flat stone where the sandwiches should have been and they were not there,burgess-busterbrown
they had disappeared as completely as if they never had been and old man coyote had taken care to leave no trace of his visit,burgess-busterbrown
guess this old pasture is no place for me to day,burgess-busterbrown
this is the end of the adventures of buster bear in this book because guess why,burgess-busterbrown
alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversation,carroll-alice
when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the hedge,carroll-alice
she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it,carroll-alice
which was very likely true,carroll-alice
i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth,carroll-alice
how funny it ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward,carroll-alice
and what an ignorant little girl she ll think me for asking,carroll-alice
dinah was the cat,carroll-alice
but do cats eat bats i wonder,carroll-alice
she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat,carroll-alice
there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late it s getting,carroll-alice
however on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted,carroll-alice
for you see so many out of the way things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible,carroll-alice
,carroll-alice
and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden,carroll-alice
when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried,carroll-alice
why there s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person,carroll-alice
holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out of the way things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way,carroll-alice
chapter ii,carroll-alice
for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off,carroll-alice
and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it,carroll-alice
oh dear what nonsense i m talking,carroll-alice
stop this moment i tell you,carroll-alice
oh,carroll-alice
and yesterday things went on just as usual,carroll-alice
ah that s the great puzzle,carroll-alice
i ll try if i know all the things i used to know,carroll-alice
i must have been changed for mabel,carroll-alice
ever so many lessons to learn,carroll-alice
cried alice with a sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down,carroll-alice
i must be growing small again,carroll-alice
the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never,carroll-alice
alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station,carroll-alice
that will be a queer thing to be sure,carroll-alice
so she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool,carroll-alice
for with all her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened,carroll-alice
cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal s feelings,carroll-alice
well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone don t be angry about it,carroll-alice
we indeed,carroll-alice
i won t indeed,carroll-alice
and it ll fetch things when you throw them and it ll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of things i can t remember half of them and it belongs to a farmer you know and he says it s so useful it s worth a hundred pounds,carroll-alice
do come back again and we won t talk about cats or dogs either if you don t like them,carroll-alice
a caucus race and a long tale,carroll-alice
i ll soon make you dry enough,carroll-alice
this is the driest thing i know,carroll-alice
said the lory with a shiver,carroll-alice
i thought you did said the mouse,carroll-alice
found it the mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what it means,carroll-alice
but the insolence of his normans how are you getting on now my dear,carroll-alice
said the eaglet,carroll-alice
said alice not that she wanted much to know but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything,carroll-alice
however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out the race is over,carroll-alice
quite a chorus of voices asked,carroll-alice
but she must have a prize herself you know said the mouse,carroll-alice
hand it over here said the dodo,carroll-alice
you promised to tell me your history you know said alice and why it is you hate c and d she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended again,carroll-alice
fury said to a mouse that he met in the house let us both go to law i will prosecute you come i ll take no denial we must have a trial for really this morning i ve nothing to do,carroll-alice
what are you thinking of,carroll-alice
said alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her,carroll-alice
pleaded poor alice,carroll-alice
but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quicker,carroll-alice
said the young crab a little snappishly,carroll-alice
and who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question,carroll-alice
why she ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it,carroll-alice
on various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone,carroll-alice
i wonder if i shall ever see you any more,carroll-alice
it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess,carroll-alice
where can i have dropped them i wonder,carroll-alice
and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made,carroll-alice
rabbit engraved upon it,carroll-alice
come here directly and get ready for your walk,carroll-alice
there was no label this time with the words drink me but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips,carroll-alice
alas,carroll-alice
luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy,carroll-alice
there ought to be a book written about me that there ought,carroll-alice
oh you foolish alice,carroll-alice
mary ann,carroll-alice
alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it,carroll-alice
next came an angry voice the rabbit s pat,carroll-alice
digging for apples indeed,carroll-alice
now tell me pat what s that in the window,carroll-alice
why it fills the whole window,carroll-alice
and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air,carroll-alice
as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could,carroll-alice
catch hold of this rope will the roof bear mind that loose slate oh it s coming down,carroll-alice
oh,carroll-alice
she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she couldn t guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next,carroll-alice
tell us all about it,carroll-alice
said the rabbit s voice and alice called out as loud as she could if you do,carroll-alice
a barrowful of what,carroll-alice
if i eat one of these cakes she thought it s sure to make some change in my size and as it can t possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i suppose,carroll-alice
the first thing i ve got to do said alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden,carroll-alice
said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing,carroll-alice
oh dear,carroll-alice
alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances,carroll-alice
who are you,carroll-alice
said the caterpillar sternly,carroll-alice
it isn t said the caterpillar,carroll-alice
said the caterpillar contemptuously,carroll-alice
said the caterpillar,carroll-alice
this sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back again,carroll-alice
alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing,carroll-alice
well i ve tried to say how doth the little busy bee but it all came different,carroll-alice
in my youth father william replied to his son i feared it might injure the brain but now that i m perfectly sure i have none why i do it again and again,carroll-alice
you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully clever,carroll-alice
not quite right i m afraid said alice timidly some of the words have got altered,carroll-alice
oh i m not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one doesn t like changing so often you know,carroll-alice
well i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldn t mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to be,carroll-alice
and she thought of herself i wish the creatures wouldn t be so easily offended,carroll-alice
one side of what,carroll-alice
however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand,carroll-alice
,carroll-alice
what can all that green stuff be,carroll-alice
as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent,carroll-alice
said alice indignantly,carroll-alice
i ve tried the roots of trees and i ve tried banks and i ve tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but those serpents,carroll-alice
i m very sorry you ve been annoyed said alice who was beginning to see its meaning,carroll-alice
i m a i m a,carroll-alice
i i m a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day,carroll-alice
you re a serpent and there s no use denying it,carroll-alice
it matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but i m not looking for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldn t want yours i don t like them raw,carroll-alice
it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual,carroll-alice
as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high,carroll-alice
for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fish and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles,carroll-alice
the frog footman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little from the queen,carroll-alice
there s no sort of use in knocking said the footman and that for two reasons,carroll-alice
for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know,carroll-alice
i shall sit here the footman remarked till tomorrow,carroll-alice
are you to get in at all,carroll-alice
it s enough to drive one crazy,carroll-alice
anything you like said the footman and began whistling,carroll-alice
alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezing,carroll-alice
it s a cheshire cat said the duchess and that s why,carroll-alice
i don t know of any that do alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation,carroll-alice
oh please mind what you re doing,carroll-alice
just think of what work it would make with the day and night,carroll-alice
oh don t bother me said the duchess i never could abide figures,carroll-alice
wow,carroll-alice
chorus,carroll-alice
you may nurse it a bit if you like,carroll-alice
the poor little thing was snorting like a steam engine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it,carroll-alice
the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it,carroll-alice
mind now,carroll-alice
so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood,carroll-alice
cheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider,carroll-alice
then it doesn t matter which way you go said the cat,carroll-alice
in that direction the cat said waving its right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives a march hare,carroll-alice
you re mad,carroll-alice
to begin with said the cat a dog s not mad,carroll-alice
therefore i m mad,carroll-alice
you ll see me there said the cat and vanished,carroll-alice
i d nearly forgotten to ask,carroll-alice
as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on a branch of a tree,carroll-alice
well,carroll-alice
i almost wish i d gone to see the hatter instead,carroll-alice
the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room,carroll-alice
have some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tone,carroll-alice
it wasn t very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the march hare,carroll-alice
the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writing desk,carroll-alice
said the march hare,carroll-alice
said the hatter,carroll-alice
the hatter was the first to break the silence,carroll-alice
sighed the hatter,carroll-alice
the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter you know,carroll-alice
why should it,carroll-alice
alice felt dreadfully puzzled,carroll-alice
have you guessed the riddle yet,carroll-alice
alice sighed wearily,carroll-alice
of course you don t,carroll-alice
that accounts for it said the hatter,carroll-alice
i only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a whisper,carroll-alice
the hatter shook his head mournfully,carroll-alice
how i wonder what you re at,carroll-alice
twinkle twinkle,carroll-alice
exclaimed alice,carroll-alice
she asked,carroll-alice
but what happens when you come to the beginning again,carroll-alice
i m afraid i don t know one said alice rather alarmed at the proposal,carroll-alice
the dormouse slowly opened his eyes,carroll-alice
pleaded alice,carroll-alice
they lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a minute or two,carroll-alice
i ve had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i can t take more,carroll-alice
alice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and bread and butter and then turned to the dormouse and repeated her question,carroll-alice
sh,carroll-alice
one indeed,carroll-alice
said alice quite forgetting her promise,carroll-alice
alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very cautiously but i don t understand,carroll-alice
this answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it,carroll-alice
said the march hare,carroll-alice
this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot,carroll-alice
that s very curious,carroll-alice
once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table,carroll-alice
a large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red,carroll-alice
always lay the blame on others,carroll-alice
said the one who had spoken first,carroll-alice
seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed low,carroll-alice
the queen,carroll-alice
next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her,carroll-alice
she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in reply,carroll-alice
and who are these,carroll-alice
the queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed off with her head,carroll-alice
the queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them over,carroll-alice
screamed the queen,carroll-alice
said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses,carroll-alice
the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others,carroll-alice
that s right,carroll-alice
shouted alice,carroll-alice
she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her face,carroll-alice
he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered she s under sentence of execution,carroll-alice
no i didn t said alice i don t think it s at all a pity,carroll-alice
the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone,carroll-alice
alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet ground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches,carroll-alice
alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she what would become of me,carroll-alice
alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded,carroll-alice
how do you like the queen,carroll-alice
said the king going up to alice and looking at the cat s head with great curiosity,carroll-alice
he got behind alice as he spoke,carroll-alice
the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small,carroll-alice
she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not,carroll-alice
when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable,carroll-alice
it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious,carroll-alice
chapter ix,carroll-alice
when i m a duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though i won t have any pepper in my kitchen at all,carroll-alice
i can t tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit,carroll-alice
and she squeezed herself up closer to alice s side as she spoke,carroll-alice
somebody said alice whispered that it s done by everybody minding their own business,carroll-alice
i dare say you re wondering why i don t put my arm round your waist the duchess said after a pause the reason is that i m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo,carroll-alice
only mustard isn t a bird alice remarked,carroll-alice
oh i know,carroll-alice
that s nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess replied in a pleased tone,carroll-alice
a cheap sort of present,carroll-alice
the duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chin,carroll-alice
a fine day your majesty,carroll-alice
let s go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquet ground,carroll-alice
then the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle yet,carroll-alice
come on then said the queen and he shall tell you his history,carroll-alice
if you don t know what a gryphon is look at the picture,carroll-alice
the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled,carroll-alice
why she said the gryphon,carroll-alice
they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break,carroll-alice
so they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothing,carroll-alice
but she waited patiently,carroll-alice
when we were little the mock turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the sea,carroll-alice
you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth,carroll-alice
i never said i didn t,carroll-alice
the mock turtle went on,carroll-alice
yes said alice we learned french and music,carroll-alice
ah,carroll-alice
said the mock turtle with a sigh,carroll-alice
i never heard of uglification alice ventured to say,carroll-alice
it exclaimed,carroll-alice
well there was mystery the mock turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers mystery ancient and modern with seaography then drawling the drawling master was an old conger eel that used to come once a week he taught us drawling stretching and fainting in coils,carroll-alice
hadn t time said the gryphon i went to the classics master though,carroll-alice
said alice in a hurry to change the subject,carroll-alice
this was quite a new idea to alice and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark,carroll-alice
that s enough about lessons the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone tell her something about the games now,carroll-alice
same as if he had a bone in his throat said the gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back,carroll-alice
why said the gryphon you first form into a line along the sea shore,carroll-alice
you advance twice,carroll-alice
then you know the mock turtle went on you throw the,carroll-alice
screamed the gryphon,carroll-alice
back to land again and that s all the first figure said the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice,carroll-alice
come let s try the first figure,carroll-alice
i ve forgotten the words,carroll-alice
see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance,carroll-alice
but the snail replied too far too far,carroll-alice
his scaly friend replied,carroll-alice
thank you it s a very interesting dance to watch said alice feeling very glad that it was over at last and i do so like that curious song about the whiting,carroll-alice
they have their tails in their mouths and they re all over crumbs,carroll-alice
so they had to fall a long way,carroll-alice
i never knew so much about a whiting before,carroll-alice
it does the boots and shoes,carroll-alice
why what are your shoes done with,carroll-alice
boots and shoes under the sea the gryphon went on in a deep voice are done with a whiting,carroll-alice
if i d been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still running on the song i d have said to the porpoise keep back please we don t want you with us,carroll-alice
don t you mean purpose,carroll-alice
explain all that said the mock turtle,carroll-alice
her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said that s very curious,carroll-alice
tell her to begin,carroll-alice
however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed,carroll-alice
well i never heard it before said the mock turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsense,carroll-alice
but about his toes,carroll-alice
go on with the next verse the gryphon repeated impatiently it begins i passed by his garden,carroll-alice
what is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle interrupted if you don t explain it as you go on,carroll-alice
or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song,carroll-alice
beautiful soup so rich and green waiting in a hot tureen,carroll-alice
beau ootiful soo oop,carroll-alice
pennyworth only of beautiful soup,carroll-alice
cried the gryphon and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it when a cry of the trial s beginning,carroll-alice
alice panted as she ran but the gryphon only answered come on,carroll-alice
the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about them all sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other,carroll-alice
the judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becoming,carroll-alice
what are they doing,carroll-alice
alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court,carroll-alice
thought alice,carroll-alice
said the king,carroll-alice
the rabbit hastily interrupted,carroll-alice
i beg pardon your majesty he began for bringing these in but i hadn t quite finished my tea when i was sent for,carroll-alice
fifteenth said the march hare,carroll-alice
stolen,carroll-alice
give your evidence said the king and don t be nervous or i ll have you executed on the spot,carroll-alice
i can hardly breathe,carroll-alice
and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court,carroll-alice
the twinkling of the what,carroll-alice
do you take me for a dunce,carroll-alice
you did,carroll-alice
well at any rate the dormouse said the hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep,carroll-alice
you must remember remarked the king or i ll have you executed,carroll-alice
as that is rather a hard word i will just explain to you how it was done,carroll-alice
i can t go no lower said the hatter i m on the floor as it is,carroll-alice
now we shall get on better,carroll-alice
said the king,carroll-alice
the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice your majesty must cross examine this witness,carroll-alice
behead that dormouse,carroll-alice
for some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappeared,carroll-alice
it quite makes my forehead ache,carroll-alice
here,carroll-alice
alice looked at the jury box and saw that in her haste she had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move,carroll-alice
nothing said alice,carroll-alice
they were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the white rabbit interrupted unimportant your majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke,carroll-alice
at this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in his note book cackled out silence,carroll-alice
you are said the king,carroll-alice
the king turned pale and shut his note book hastily,carroll-alice
i haven t opened it yet said the white rabbit but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner to to somebody,carroll-alice
he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isn t a letter after all it s a set of verses,carroll-alice
he must have imitated somebody else s hand said the king,carroll-alice
there was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day,carroll-alice
read them said the king,carroll-alice
these were the verses the white rabbit read,carroll-alice
my notion was that you had been before she had this fit an obstacle that came between him and ourselves and it,carroll-alice
the jury all wrote down on their slates she doesn t believe there s an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paper,carroll-alice
the knave shook his head sadly,carroll-alice
but it goes on they all returned from him to you said alice,carroll-alice
he said to the queen,carroll-alice
there was a dead silence,carroll-alice
sentence first verdict afterwards,carroll-alice
said the queen turning purple,carroll-alice
nobody moved,carroll-alice
wake up alice dear,carroll-alice
but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream,carroll-alice
the ball and the cross by g k chesterton 1909,chesterton-ball
the professor had himself invented the flying machine and had also invented nearly everything in it,chesterton-ball
that object which seemed to be created by the entanglement of two corkscrews was really the key,chesterton-ball
him also by a curious coincidence the professor had not invented and him he had not even very greatly improved though he had fished him up with a lasso out of his own back garden in western bulgaria with the pure object of improving him,chesterton-ball
the old monk one of whose names was michael and the other a name quite impossible to remember or repeat in our western civilization had however as i have said made himself quite happy while he was in a mountain hermitage in the society of wild animals,chesterton-ball
everything demonstrates it,chesterton-ball
in your religion and all the religions as far as i know and i know everything the sky is made the symbol of everything that is sacred and merciful,chesterton-ball
the heavens are evil the sky is evil the stars are evil,chesterton-ball
the fiery crypts the lurid cellars of the underworld to which you once condemned the wicked are hideous enough but at least they are more homely than the heaven in which we ride,chesterton-ball
come come said the professor encouragingly i ll help you out,chesterton-ball
well in point of fact when your flying ship is just going to run into something,chesterton-ball
the professor s eyes were blazing like a maniac s,chesterton-ball
here man shall be as innocent as the daisies as innocent and as cruel here the intellect,chesterton-ball
then a shriek indescribable broke out of him of a sudden and he flung up his arms like a lost spirit,chesterton-ball
there was as it were a deadly shock in the fact that there was no shock,chesterton-ball
through the dense london atmosphere they could see below them the flaming london lights lights which lay beneath them in squares and oblongs of fire,chesterton-ball
they had broken through a roof and come into a temple of twilight,chesterton-ball
may i with all respect inquire asked the old monk what on earth you are talking about,chesterton-ball
and he pointed up to the cross his face dark with a grin,chesterton-ball
it is a four legged animal with one leg longer than the others,chesterton-ball
that silent thing up there is essentially a collision a crash a struggle in stone,chesterton-ball
the very shape of it is a contradiction in terms,chesterton-ball
that is a struggle in stone,chesterton-ball
the professor frowned thoughtfully for an instant and said of course everything is relative and i would not deny that the element of struggle and self contradiction represented by that cross has a necessary place at a certain evolutionary stage,chesterton-ball
the cross is on top of the ball said professor lucifer simply,chesterton-ball
and the fruit should be at the top of the tree not at the bottom of it,chesterton-ball
you would see i think that thing happen which is always the ultimate embodiment and logical outcome of your logical scheme,chesterton-ball
lucifer made an angry movement and opened his mouth to speak but michael with all his air of deliberation was proceeding before he could bring out a word,chesterton-ball
his history is rather amusing,chesterton-ball
finally in a height of frenzy he climbed the steeple of the parish church and tore down the cross waving it in the air and uttering wild soliloquies up there under the stars,chesterton-ball
mile after mile along his homeward path he broke it down and tore it up,chesterton-ball
he broke his furniture because it was made of crosses,chesterton-ball
he asked,chesterton-ball
we leave you saying that nobody ought to join the church against his will,chesterton-ball
lucifer leapt upon him with a cry like a wild beast s,chesterton-ball
michael with as abrupt an agility caught one of the beams of the cross and saved himself from falling,chesterton-ball
for practical purposes of support replied michael grimly it is at any rate a great deal better than the ball,chesterton-ball
cried the professor in ungovernable excitement,chesterton-ball
i shall mount up as much as you will,chesterton-ball
those who look at the matter most superficially regard paradox as something which belongs to jesting and light journalism,chesterton-ball
this kind of paradox may be clearly perceived by anybody who happens to be hanging in mid space clinging to one arm of the cross of st paul s,chesterton-ball
his one wild chance of coming out safely would be in not too desperately desiring to be safe,chesterton-ball
now he knew the truth that is known to all fighters and hunters and climbers of cliffs,chesterton-ball
and if it is impossible to dogmatize about such states it is still more impossible to describe them,chesterton-ball
at the highest crisis of some incurable anguish there will suddenly fall upon the man the stillness of an insane contentment,chesterton-ball
it is not negative in the least it is as positive as good news,chesterton-ball
this mysterious mood lasted long enough to start him on his dreadful descent and to force him to continue it,chesterton-ball
he paused a little panting in the gallery under the ball and idly kicked his heels moving a few yards along it,chesterton-ball
he thought how nice it would be if he had to live up in that gallery with that one man for ever,chesterton-ball
in the confused colour and music of his new paradise michael heard only in a faint and distant fashion some remarks that this beautiful solid man seemed to be making to him remarks about something or other being after hours and against orders,chesterton-ball
michael realized that the image of god in nickel buttons was asking him how he had come there,chesterton-ball
he led him by the arm towards a door leading into the building itself soothing him all the time,chesterton-ball
but he only wished to stand to stand and stare,chesterton-ball
and far below lower even than the lights could be seen creeping or motionless great black masses of men,chesterton-ball
you come along with me,chesterton-ball
he felt suddenly happy and suddenly indescribably small,chesterton-ball
he relished the squareness of the houses he liked their clean angles as if he had just cut them with a knife,chesterton-ball
suddenly through all the din of the dark streets came a crash of glass,chesterton-ball
anybody would have done it,chesterton-ball
he cried trembling,chesterton-ball
the whole peace of the world was pent up painfully in his heart,chesterton-ball
they should not go from that place till they went home embracing like brothers and shouting like men delivered,chesterton-ball
i found him wandering in the cathedral,chesterton-ball
they took the tall young man away to a magistrate whither we shall follow him in an ensuing chapter,chesterton-ball
the paper was unsuited to the atmosphere,chesterton-ball
it was in vain that he hung in conspicuous places the most thrilling scientific calculations about the width of the throat of a whale,chesterton-ball
he might have spared his emotion,chesterton-ball
every day his blasphemies looked more glaring and every day the dust lay thicker upon them,chesterton-ball
the socialists said he was cursing priests when he should be cursing capitalists,chesterton-ball
his high hawklike features and snaky black hair bore the mark of that unknown historic thing which is crudely called celtic but which is probably far older than the celts whoever they were,chesterton-ball
he was somewhat surprised at the lack of deference shown to the figure by the people bustling by,chesterton-ball
on that fantastic fringe of the gaelic land where he walked as a boy the cliffs were as fantastic as the clouds,chesterton-ball
evan lived like a man walking on a borderland the borderland between this world and another,chesterton-ball
all through his life he thought of the daylight world as a sort of divine debris the broken remainder of his first vision,chesterton-ball
his great grandfather had been cut down at culloden certain in his last instant that god would restore the king,chesterton-ball
he was in his own fancy a conspirator fierce and up to date,chesterton-ball
he had one shock of sentiment when he turned that wonderful corner of fleet street and saw st paul s sitting in the sky,chesterton-ball
and it was in a mood of mere idle investigation that he happened to come to a standstill opposite the office of,chesterton-ball
he received the very considerable amount of information accumulated by the author with that tired clearness of the mind which children have on heavy summer afternoons that tired clearness which leads them to go on asking questions long after they have lost interest in the subject and are as bored as their nurse,chesterton-ball
he learnt that the name sho under its third form of psa occurs in an early legend which describes how the deity after the manner of jupiter on so many occasions seduced a virgin and begat a hero,chesterton-ball
then he did understand it,chesterton-ball
because it was the quickest cut to you cried evan stamping,chesterton-ball
asked turnbull glaring,chesterton-ball
a great light like dawn came into mr turnbull s face,chesterton-ball
and as not unfrequently happens to middle aged gentlemen when they see a new youth opening before them he found himself in the presence of the police,chesterton-ball
and the editor s fine rational republican appeals to his respect for law and his ardour to be tried by his fellow citizens seemed to the police quite as much gibberish as evan s mysticism could have done,chesterton-ball
he looked like a gentleman and yet somehow like a stage gentleman,chesterton-ball
he is not my friend said evan with the stolidity of a dull child,chesterton-ball
he is my enemy said evan simply he is the enemy of god,chesterton-ball
religion is a too personal a matter to be mentioned in such a place,chesterton-ball
slight applause,chesterton-ball
may i ask why you smashed this worthy citizen s window,chesterton-ball
the most religious people are not those who talk about it,chesterton-ball
you asked me why i broke his window said macian with a face of wood,chesterton-ball
you are not going the right way to work sir he said with severity,chesterton-ball
i really believe you are insane said the stipendiary indignantly for he had really been doing his best as a good natured man to compose the dispute,chesterton-ball
exploded vane,chesterton-ball
oh you want a nurse to look after you he said,chesterton-ball
then he said may i say a word your worship,chesterton-ball
do not be afraid,chesterton-ball
if he had said of my mother what he said of the mother of god there is not a club of clean men in europe that would deny my right to call him out,chesterton-ball
if a man must not fight for this may he fight for anything,chesterton-ball
shall i not fight for my own existence,chesterton-ball
let other people have a chance laughter,chesterton-ball
certainly not answered macian,chesterton-ball
but he says he will not,chesterton-ball
no your worship,chesterton-ball
you re ozone after that fellow,chesterton-ball
evan went out of the court of justice free but strangely shaken like a sick man,chesterton-ball
its eyes were grey and awful and its beard red,chesterton-ball
he stammered out something he knew not what he only guessed it by the answer of the other,chesterton-ball
haven t you hung atheists and burned them and boiled them and did they ever deny their faith,chesterton-ball
i know said turnbull scornfully,chesterton-ball
now fight if you dare,chesterton-ball
i swear it by the holy island where my fathers are by the honour of my mother by the secret of my people and by the chalice of the blood of god,chesterton-ball
the evening sky a dome of solid gold unflaked even by a single sunset cloud steeped the meanest sights of london in a strange and mellow light,chesterton-ball
a row of half burnished seventeenth century swords ran like an ornate railing along the front of the window behind was a darker glimmer of old oak and old armour and higher up hung the most extraordinary looking south sea tools or utensils whether designed for killing enemies or merely for cooking them no mere white man could possibly conjecture,chesterton-ball
it would easily have made him beautiful if he had been merely squalid if he had been a jew of the fagin type,chesterton-ball
the name over his shop was henry gordon but two scotchmen who were in his shop that evening could come upon no trace of a scotch accent,chesterton-ball
they were fastidious about them,chesterton-ball
and perhaps i had better pay for them at once,chesterton-ball
unfortunately as the police are in some sense pursuing us we are hurried and must fight now and without seconds,chesterton-ball
a duel in my garden,chesterton-ball
well this is a funny game he said,chesterton-ball
why er yes said gordon,chesterton-ball
i will leave the religion of humanity confidently in your hands but i am sorry i troubled you about such a thing as honour,chesterton-ball
i am going to die for it if need be under that sword on your counter,chesterton-ball
be still,chesterton-ball
the man was too frightened to scream but he struggled wildly while evan macian whose long lean hands were unusually powerful tightened some old curtain cords round him strapped a rope gag in his mouth and rolled him on his back on the floor,chesterton-ball
and now said turnbull twirling his fiery moustache and fingering his sword let us go into the garden,chesterton-ball
yet macian was not exactly ready,chesterton-ball
i see jerusalem said evan all covered with the shields and standards of the saracens,chesterton-ball
i beg your pardon said macian dryly,chesterton-ball
but it was indeed the more dreadful apathy of one who wants something and will care for nothing else,chesterton-ball
the next moment turnbull lunged macian seemed to catch the point and throw it away from him and was thrusting back like a thunderbolt when a sound paralysed him another sound beside their ringing weapons,chesterton-ball
the old jew has broken one of his strings and he s crawling about said turnbull,chesterton-ball
cried the highlander,chesterton-ball
he narrowed and so to speak tightened his operations he fenced as the swordsman s boast goes in a wedding ring he turned turnbull s thrusts with a maddening and almost mechanical click like that of a machine,chesterton-ball
and high above all the sound of the struggle there broke into the silent evening a bellowing human voice nasal raucous at the highest pitch of pain,chesterton-ball
murder,chesterton-ball
the voice of the screaming shopkeeper was loud enough to drown not only the noise of the swords but all other noises around it but even through its rending din there seemed to be some other stir or scurry,chesterton-ball
and there isn t a damned second to lose either,chesterton-ball
turnbull put his fingers to his mouth like a gutter snipe and whistled twice,chesterton-ball
we want you said macian to the cabman with a superb scotch drawl of indifference and assurance to drive us to st pancras station verra quick,chesterton-ball
cabby said macian again assuming the most deliberate and lingering lowland scotch intonation if ye re really verra anxious to ken whar a come fra i ll tell ye as a verra great secret,chesterton-ball
the heavy voice behind the wall said now then a better back this time mr,chesterton-ball
open the doors cabby he repeated with something of the obstinate solemnity of a drunkard open the doors,chesterton-ball
give me his hat said turnbull in a silver voice that the other obeyed like a bugle,chesterton-ball
mr macian he said shortly and civilly,chesterton-ball
we have broken the law and we are fleeing from its officers,chesterton-ball
it is strongly borne in upon me that you and i the sole occupants of this runaway cab are at this moment the two most important people in london possibly in europe,chesterton-ball
it means us,chesterton-ball
we fight this thing out somewhere because as you truly say we have found each other s reality,chesterton-ball
now you that i am an honest man and you are mad against me as i am against you,chesterton-ball
don t run into anything said evan immovably,chesterton-ball
but in case it had the amateur cabman chose his dizzy course through london with a strange dexterity,chesterton-ball
in one of the quieter streets evan put on his boots,chesterton-ball
perfectly replied the other with his bootlace in his teeth,chesterton-ball
all duellists should behave like gentlemen to each other,chesterton-ball
they had reached finchley road before he opened it again,chesterton-ball
and he began to smoke in the cab,chesterton-ball
as far as their own feelings went they had melted into a monstrous sea they were but the fare and driver of one of the million hansoms that fill london streets,chesterton-ball
we do not announce on flaring posters that a man has not fallen off a scaffolding,chesterton-ball
they cannot announce the happiness of mankind at all,chesterton-ball
but when the same man was brought before a magistrate and defied his enemy to mortal combat in the open court then the columns would hardly hold the excruciating information and the headlines were so large that there was hardly room for any of the text,chesterton-ball
but the journalistic temperature was steadily and consistently heated by all these influences the journalists had tasted blood prospectively and were in the mood for more everything in the matter prepared them for further outbursts of moral indignation,chesterton-ball
etc,chesterton-ball
etc,chesterton-ball
questions were asked about it and even answered in the house of commons,chesterton-ball
and a song consisting of an unimaginable number of verses in which his name was rhymed with flat iron the british lion sly un dandelion spion with kop in the next line was sung to crowded houses every night,chesterton-ball
from the spot where turnbull and macian were sitting on one of the barren steeps behind hampstead they could see the whole of london shaping itself vaguely and largely in the grey and growing light until the white sun stood over it and it lay at their feet the splendid monstrosity that it is,chesterton-ball
and after denouncing so justly average modern men for so many years as sophists and as slaves he looked down from an empty slope in hampstead and saw what gods they are,chesterton-ball
turnbull as he stared drearily murmured to himself the words of the old atheistic and revolutionary swinburne who had intoxicated his youth,chesterton-ball
but turnbull s songs at their best were songs after sunrise and sunrise had been no such great thing after all,chesterton-ball
it s a very big place,chesterton-ball
i am used to big things where i come from big mountains that seem to fill god s infinity and the big sea that goes to the end of the world,chesterton-ball
oh,chesterton-ball
the two swords with which they had lately sought each other s lives were flung down on the grass at random like two idle walking sticks,chesterton-ball
do you mind if i light up,chesterton-ball
the matter on which you and i are engaged is at this moment really the best copy in england,chesterton-ball
you seem unable to understand the ordinary use of the human language,chesterton-ball
i only meant that you and i are the most prominent people in the english papers,chesterton-ball
yes he said in his simple way,chesterton-ball
the point of the sword said macian violently and planted the steel point in the soil like a man planting a tree,chesterton-ball
you must listen to me not merely because i know the country which you might learn by looking at a map but because i know the people of the country whom you could not know by living here thirty years,chesterton-ball
for the next six mortal months they will think of nothing but us as for six mortal months they thought of nothing but the dreyfus case,chesterton-ball
we shall prevent the chinese being sent out of the transvaal and the blocks being stopped in the strand,chesterton-ball
we must be prepared for our descriptions being sent to every tiny village and for our faces being recognized by every ambitious policeman,chesterton-ball
macian was looking at the horizon with a rather misty look,chesterton-ball
to smash your window said macian,chesterton-ball
fortunately i know the part well and if you will follow me exactly and when necessary on your stomach we may be able to get ten miles out of london literally without meeting anyone at all which will be the best possible beginning at any rate,chesterton-ball
and the brandy,chesterton-ball
and he set off ahead at a swinging walk,chesterton-ball
evan made no reply,chesterton-ball
you ve got it,chesterton-ball
asked turnbull,chesterton-ball
i must kill you here he cried with a sort of tearful rage impossible to describe,chesterton-ball
quick,chesterton-ball
well i never thought much of god said the editor of losing all patience,chesterton-ball
in a moment it will be gone said the madman,chesterton-ball
i must kill you now said the fanatic because,chesterton-ball
your affection expresses itself in an abrupt form he began but macian broke the brittle and frivolous speech to pieces with a violent voice,chesterton-ball
turnbull s face flinched again in the fierce sunlight but his attitude kept its contemptuous ease,chesterton-ball
you mean the same yourself,chesterton-ball
turnbull took out his own sword suddenly as if to engage then planting it point downwards for a moment he said before we begin may i ask you a question,chesterton-ball
i should feel that because i had been weak justice had not been done,chesterton-ball
i wish we could have it out now replied the other firmly,chesterton-ball
no said evan thoughtfully i do not say that,chesterton-ball
the church is not a thing like the athenaeum club he cried,chesterton-ball
confound it all don t you see that i am more sure of its existence than i am of my own existence,chesterton-ball
evan remained in an unmoved and grave attitude,chesterton-ball
whatever in earth or heaven it is that has joined us two together it seems to be something which makes it impossible to lie,chesterton-ball
no it is not some trifle that we are fighting about,chesterton-ball
turnbull s face wore an indecipherable expression,chesterton-ball
it was not in that way that the swords rang together when they had rushed on each other in the little garden behind the dealer s shop,chesterton-ball
it was as quick as the snap of a pistol and they altered it instantaneously and recovered their original pose but they had both made it they had both seen it and they both knew what it was,chesterton-ball
their hearts were growing weaker and weaker against each other,chesterton-ball
it was something that seemed all the more merciless because it might turn out an enormous mercy,chesterton-ball
it was incongruous with the eccentric spectacle of the duellists which ought to have startled a sane and free man,chesterton-ball
he was a heavy healthy looking man who looked all the larger because of the loose light coloured clothes that he wore and that had in their extreme lightness and looseness almost a touch of the tropics,chesterton-ball
now you don t mind my saying this do you,chesterton-ball
do you know what i always say to young people,chesterton-ball
dry scotch humour,chesterton-ball
we ve quite outgrown duelling you know,chesterton-ball
now they tell me in the newspapers that you are really wanting to fight about something connected with roman catholicism,chesterton-ball
without enlarging further on the fixed form of his appeal to the church of rome he laughed cordially at turnbull s answer then his wandering blue eyes caught the sunlight on the swords and he assumed a good humoured gravity,chesterton-ball
is not bloodshed a great sin,chesterton-ball
there is no sin of bloodshed,chesterton-ball
what is the good of words if they aren t important enough to quarrel over,chesterton-ball
the church and the heresies always used to fight about words because they are the only things worth fighting about,chesterton-ball
ah you re a casuist,chesterton-ball
well well he said let us get back to the point,chesterton-ball
so you see how i am placed,chesterton-ball
you will not call the police,chesterton-ball
it is against the principle of love,chesterton-ball
when you were a baby i suppose you loved your mother,chesterton-ball
keep clear of it keep silent upon it as you would upon an abomination,chesterton-ball
hate it in god s name as turnbull does who is a man,chesterton-ball
suppose i call the police,chesterton-ball
oh we have no you know,chesterton-ball
turnbull with a bent flushed face was tying up the loose piece of the pommel with string,chesterton-ball
as he disappeared among the trees they heard him murmuring in a sing song voice new occasions teach new duties out of a poem by james russell lowell,chesterton-ball
well,chesterton-ball
we know that devils sometimes quote scripture and counterfeit good replied the mystic,chesterton-ball
give up vows and dogmas and fixed things and you may grow like that,chesterton-ball
but do not fear for me now,chesterton-ball
suddenly furious as they were they were frozen for a moment motionless,chesterton-ball
what,chesterton-ball
the other philosopher,chesterton-ball
the two men running in it had an impression not uncommonly experienced between those wild green english walls a sense of being led between the walls of a maze,chesterton-ball
said turnbull with civility,chesterton-ball
asked turnbull,chesterton-ball
they are too fat,chesterton-ball
but they won t catch us said macian in his literal way,chesterton-ball
he said for turnbull had gone silent suddenly and seemed to be listening intently as he ran as a horse does with his ears turned back,chesterton-ball
macian slackened his trot and turned his head to the trail they had left behind them,chesterton-ball
what shall we do,chesterton-ball
if we could hide somewhere the beasts might go by us he said,chesterton-ball
he suddenly swung himself up the high bank on one side of the lane,chesterton-ball
his red hair and beard looked almost scarlet and his pale face as bright as a boy s,chesterton-ball
men who had loved each other and then fought each other men who had fought each other and then loved each other together made a mixed but monstrous sense of momentousness,chesterton-ball
do you see that summer house looking thing over there,chesterton-ball
that is quite invisible from the road said turnbull as he entered it and it will cover us up for the night,chesterton-ball
in the sudden silence the drumming of the distant horses grew louder and louder with inconceivable rapidity and the cavalcade of police rushed by below them in the lane almost with the roar and rattle of an express train,chesterton-ball
and it was broken by three heavy blows of a stick delivered upon the door,chesterton-ball
god knows said the other,chesterton-ball
a wild look sprang into macian s eyes and he got up half stupidly with a kind of stagger put his hand out and caught one of the swords,chesterton-ball
but he also picked up a sword as he stepped to open it,chesterton-ball
he was a small man with two wisps of long hair that curled up on each side and seen in silhouette looked like horns,chesterton-ball
who on earth are you,chesterton-ball
certainly said turnbull and went outside with the sword macian following,chesterton-ball
but within this feminine frame of hair his face was unexpectedly impudent like a monkey s,chesterton-ball
oh said macian simply i apologize,chesterton-ball
to fight,chesterton-ball
we were just going to take some slight refreshment when you interrupted us,chesterton-ball
we are forced by honour and an internal intellectual need,chesterton-ball
try and understand our position,chesterton-ball
if you like we are attempting a mutual martyrdom,chesterton-ball
put me out of my intellectual misery,chesterton-ball
yes said macian it began in a police court,chesterton-ball
come up,chesterton-ball
come in,chesterton-ball
why you fools i adore fighting,chesterton-ball
and he made sudden lunges with his stick at the trunk of a neighbouring tree so that the ferrule made fierce prints and punctures in the bark,chesterton-ball
the little man stared an instant and then said yes and turnbull broke into a guffaw,chesterton-ball
lord bless me the gods must exist after all they have sent me one of my day dreams,chesterton-ball
there was nothing about the outside to distinguish it from other cottages except indeed its ominous cleanliness and one thing that was out of all the custom and tradition of all cottages under the sun,chesterton-ball
come in,chesterton-ball
the door that closed behind them shut out england and all the energies of the west,chesterton-ball
the innermost room of all was like the inside of a jewel,chesterton-ball
and selim one of these gentlemen will probably die tomorrow,chesterton-ball
turnbull was in the little house behind him demolishing the end of an early breakfast and humming a tune to himself which could be heard through the open window,chesterton-ball
they were all the more startled because of the still posture in which they found him,chesterton-ball
let us go on to the lawn behind,chesterton-ball
macian turned his blue blinking eyes which seemed still misty with sleep or sleeplessness towards the idol but his brows drew together,chesterton-ball
he,chesterton-ball
asked turnbull gruffly,chesterton-ball
yes my friends said the little man with an animated countenance fluttering his fingers in the air it was no chance that led you to this garden surely it was the caprice of some old god some happy pitiless god,chesterton-ball
but today today continued the small man in a shrill voice,chesterton-ball
still the two duellists stood with their swords as heavily as statues and the silence seemed to cool the eccentric and call him back to more rational speech,chesterton-ball
from cornwall to cape wrath this county is one horrible solid block of humanitarianism,chesterton-ball
i had a fellowship at magdalen,chesterton-ball
here you can fall back on that naked and awful arbitration which is the only thing that balances the stars a still continuous violence,chesterton-ball
when it has been done nothing will alter it,chesterton-ball
then macian said steadily mr turnbull lend me your sword a moment,chesterton-ball
fight me now,chesterton-ball
you stinking little coward roared turnbull suddenly releasing his wrath,chesterton-ball
fight you rat,chesterton-ball
something broke inside him and he found himself running away tumbling over his own feet in terror and crying out as he ran,chesterton-ball
shoo,chesterton-ball
but macian as he ran past the south sea idol paused an instant to spring upon its pedestal,chesterton-ball
the two pursuers went over it after him like flying birds,chesterton-ball
getting dripping to his feet with the water up to his knees the worshipper of force and victory waded disconsolately to the other side and drew himself on to the bank,chesterton-ball
the village of grassley in the hole,chesterton-ball
what are you going to do,chesterton-ball
it looks so i don t know what the word is so sensible,chesterton-ball
excuse me he said it was ceremonial,chesterton-ball
perhaps it is the south sea islands or it may be magdalen college,chesterton-ball
do you really mean to say macian he said that you fancied that we the free thinkers that bradlaugh or holyoake or ingersoll believe all that dirty immoral mysticism about nature,chesterton-ball
i supposed you did repeated macian with his usual mildness but i admit that i know little of the details of your belief or disbelief,chesterton-ball
this is a case for beer,chesterton-ball
we must have the whole of this matter out thoroughly before we go a step farther,chesterton-ball
it is a good suggestion,chesterton-ball
the lower of the two roads boasted a horse pond a post office a gentleman s garden with very high hedges a microscopically small public house and two cottages,chesterton-ball
and in the valencourt arms festivity itself had some solemnity and decorum and beer was drunk with reverence as it ought to be,chesterton-ball
macian said turnbull lifting his tankard the fool who wanted us to be friends made us want to go on fighting,chesterton-ball
i am to understand then he said that you don t believe in nature,chesterton-ball
it is that i do not believe that nature exists,chesterton-ball
the first blade of grass began to tear up the earth and eat it it was interfering with nature if there is any nature,chesterton-ball
the supernatural of course he said is quite another thing the case of the supernatural is simple,chesterton-ball
turnbull turned for some reason a little red and remarked quickly that may be jolly clever for all i know,chesterton-ball
good lord in heaven,chesterton-ball
do you really mean to sit there and say that you like anybody else would not recognize the difference between a natural occurrence and a supernatural one if there could be such a thing,chesterton-ball
come outside and ascend into heaven,chesterton-ball
he stood silent for a second or two and then resumed,chesterton-ball
but if you want to know what i really think i must explain,chesterton-ball
i was taught that some things are natural and some things divine,chesterton-ball
divine,chesterton-ball
a man s free will i heard was supernatural,chesterton-ball
then he began to speak but macian continued with the same steady voice and sad eyes,chesterton-ball
man had authority because he was man,chesterton-ball
i know said macian grimly that man who talked about love for instance,chesterton-ball
but let me ask you a question in turn,chesterton-ball
but it is not quite true,chesterton-ball
said turnbull,chesterton-ball
oh yes said turnbull in a tired way i suppose you mean god,chesterton-ball
asked the atheist,chesterton-ball
all your hoary cathedrals yes even the eternal church on earth is new compared to him,chesterton-ball
i am going to ask him cried macian which of us is right,chesterton-ball
but if every man typifies god there is god,chesterton-ball
the track of the rustic was easy to follow even in the faltering dark for he was enlivening his wavering walk with song,chesterton-ball
he gave them greeting with the elaborate urbanity of the slightly intoxicated,chesterton-ball
atheists,chesterton-ball
don t talk to me about un,chesterton-ball
the old man extended a quivering stick in the direction of a distant hill,chesterton-ball
priests,chesterton-ball
that s what i say,chesterton-ball
let me try,chesterton-ball
said the old man facing round in an irrational frenzy,chesterton-ball
if a man a n t a man what is he,chesterton-ball
not a city or owt else,chesterton-ball
and the old man went on wildly singing into the night,chesterton-ball
are you turning an agnostic,chesterton-ball
we catholics have only in that sense got as far as realizing that man is a man,chesterton-ball
they had walked all night,chesterton-ball
they had talked about mr kensit in dim and twinkling pine woods amid the bewildering monotony of the pines,chesterton-ball
i begin to understand one or two of your dogmas mr turnbull he had said emphatically as they ploughed heavily up a wooded hill,chesterton-ball
nothing is plainer from real history than that each of your heretics invented a complete cosmos of his own which the next heretic smashed entirely to pieces,chesterton-ball
i defy you to go back to the free thinkers of the past and find any habitation for yourself at all,chesterton-ball
read them instead of praising them and you will find that their whole universe stands or falls with the deity,chesterton-ball
free thought may be suggestive it may be inspiriting it may have as much as you please of the merits that come from vivacity and variety,chesterton-ball
it is like asking if this corn is as yellow as that hill is steep,chesterton-ball
physical science and the catholic church,chesterton-ball
but the matter is irrelevant to my meaning,chesterton-ball
still i can see the electric light,chesterton-ball
when you quarrel with us now you class us with kingship and despotism but when you quarrelled with us first it was because we would not accept the divine despotism of henry viii,chesterton-ball
i have heard that christianity keeps the key of virtue and that if you read tom paine you will cut your throat at monte carlo,chesterton-ball
when a soldier enlists to die for his country or disgrace it do you ask whether he is a christian,chesterton-ball
but i notice that most anti christian arguments are in the same inconsistent style,chesterton-ball
why the catholics of the catholic middle ages talked about the virtues of all the virtuous pagans until humanity was sick of the subject,chesterton-ball
very well now take the other types of human virtue many of them splendid,chesterton-ball
have you ever seen an austere republican,chesterton-ball
those names and notions are all honourable but how long will they last,chesterton-ball
and suppose i don t like him,chesterton-ball
but as the ordinary man you do like him,chesterton-ball
you complain of catholicism for setting up an ideal of virginity it did nothing of the kind,chesterton-ball
no answered turnbull i trust that i am sufficiently fair minded to canvass and consider the idea but having considered it i think fleet street is right yes even if the parthenon is wrong,chesterton-ball
we have for instance a new and imaginative appreciation of children,chesterton-ball
what in the name of all the angels and devils is it except a worship of virginity,chesterton-ball
they went a little way in silence and then james turnbull said suddenly but i believe in the thing,chesterton-ball
moonrise with a great and growing moon opened over all those flats making them seem flatter and larger than they were turning them to a lake of blue light,chesterton-ball
i m sure you re thinking the same as i am he said how long are we to be on this damned seesaw,chesterton-ball
whenever we have tried to fight each other something has stopped us,chesterton-ball
nothing will jump out of bushes here anyhow he said,chesterton-ball
oh,chesterton-ball
he eyed the wind swung sword hilt in sad meditation and resumed what i mean is we might find out in this quiet place whether there really is any fate or any commandment against our enterprise,chesterton-ball
he said i will wait for signs from god until i have any signs of his existence but god or fate forbid that a man of scientific culture should refuse any kind of experiment,chesterton-ball
as old chess players open every game with established gambits they opened with a thrust and parry orthodox and even frankly ineffectual,chesterton-ball
after all he had challenged the universe to send an interruption and this was an interruption whatever else it was,chesterton-ball
god hasn t got much of a voice said turnbull who snatched at every chance of cheap profanity,chesterton-ball
moreover that great curve of the countryside which looked so slow and gentle when you glanced over it proved to be highly precipitous when you scampered over it and turnbull was twice nearly flung on his face,chesterton-ball
three of them were standing about the road giving their opinions to the moon with vague but echoing violence,chesterton-ball
she was clad in close fitting dark costume a mass of warm brown hair went out in two wings or waves on each side of her forehead and even at that distance it could be seen that her profile was of the aquiline and eager sort like a young falcon hardly free of the nest,chesterton-ball
he knew that the men were rich he knew that they were drunk and he knew what was worst of all that they were fundamentally frightened,chesterton-ball
the chauffeur had mildly objected that he was driving a lady,chesterton-ball
he lifted his stick and struck at the chauffeur who caught hold of it and the drunkard fell backwards dragging him out of his seat on the car,chesterton-ball
it was exactly at this moment that turnbull fell among them like one fallen from the sky,chesterton-ball
the whole had not taken a second and an instant after macian was in the midst of them,chesterton-ball
i haven t got a stick grumbled the disarmed man and looked vaguely about the ditch,chesterton-ball
the fourth young man was still engaged with himself kicking his legs in helpless rotation on the back of the car and talking with melodious rationality,chesterton-ball
macian plucked the struggling and aspiring idiot off the back of the car like a stray cat and left him swaying unsteadily in the moon,chesterton-ball
the motor car when he was not looking at it gave him a rude impression of a captured coach in the old days of highwaymen,chesterton-ball
he might perhaps be excused for this hungry attention,chesterton-ball
they both swung round abruptly and saw that turnbull with his recovered sword under his arm pit was already lifting the fallen chauffeur into the car,chesterton-ball
i can drive the car said the young woman in the fur cap with stony practicability,chesterton-ball
if you will tell us where you are going we will see you safely there and say good night,chesterton-ball
the slowly reviving chauffeur was set in the back seat turnbull and macian had fallen into the middle one the lady with a steely coolness had taken the driver s seat and all the handles of that headlong machine,chesterton-ball
the car shot on up and down the shining moonlit lanes and there was no sound in it except the occasional click or catch of its machinery for through some cause or other no soul inside it could think of a word to say,chesterton-ball
the difference between this experience and common experiences was analogous to that between waking life and a dream,chesterton-ball
he had never felt so much alive before and yet he was like a man in a trance,chesterton-ball
the silver moonlight picked out a piece or two of pewter ornament on his blue uniform and as they went by they knew it was a sergeant of police,chesterton-ball
there was a short silence and then turnbull said it is certainly very odd you are driving quietly enough,chesterton-ball
my god macian,chesterton-ball
you may be right he said at last if you are i must tell her,chesterton-ball
and he leant forward and spoke to the lady in the fur cap,chesterton-ball
the wind whipped back a curl of the brown hair so as to necessitate a new theory of aesthetics touching the line of the cheek bone but the head did not turn,chesterton-ball
he had expected the angels to despise him if he were wrong but not to despise him so much as this,chesterton-ball
if anyone else in the world had said the words macian would have snorted with his equine neigh of scorn,chesterton-ball
if someone had spoken of her generous ribbon or her chivalrous gloves or her merciful shoe buckle it would not have seemed to him nonsense,chesterton-ball
macian sat with bowed head listening hungrily to her voice but hardly to her words and seeing his great world drama grow smaller and smaller before his eyes till it was no bigger than a child s toy theatre,chesterton-ball
and she sighed again,chesterton-ball
a sergeant came to the side and touched his peaked cap to the lady,chesterton-ball
what are you taking them up for,chesterton-ball
she asked with the same frigid clearness,chesterton-ball
i am sure i don t want to protect criminals or go against the law but i must tell you that these gentlemen have done me a considerable service you won t mind drawing your men a little farther off while i say good night to them,chesterton-ball
macian the blood thundering in his brain at the thought of that instant of farewell bent over fumbled at the handle and flung open the door to get out,chesterton-ball
away in the vanishing distance they could see the sergeant furiously making notes,chesterton-ball
avenues of poplars on both sides of the road chased each other like the figures in a zoetrope,chesterton-ball
turnbull after a few minutes of dumb amazement had yielded to the healthiest element in his nature and gone off into uncontrollable fits of laughter,chesterton-ball
it was that mysterious moment when light is coming as if it were something unknown whose nature one could not guess a mere alteration in everything,chesterton-ball
x,chesterton-ball
round the rays of the victorious sun swept a sort of rainbow of confused and conquered colours brown and blue and green and flaming rose colour as though gold were driving before it all the colours of the world,chesterton-ball
said macian,chesterton-ball
turnbull had already opened the door on his side and jumped out,chesterton-ball
please come in if you like but i understood that you had some business,chesterton-ball
the girl tore off one of her gloves as if she were tearing off her hand,chesterton-ball
indeed the silence and the sunrise had their healing effect for when the extraordinary lady spoke again her tone was more friendly and apologetic,chesterton-ball
the girl s great brown eyes were lit up with a flash that was at once final desperation and the loosening of some private and passionate reserve,chesterton-ball
and then people come and tell me that i ought to do things and i do them and it s all drivel,chesterton-ball
i am to teach when i believe nothing at all that i was taught,chesterton-ball
asked evan in a low voice,chesterton-ball
but i may be wrong there may be a way out,chesterton-ball
you ll be all the better for a wash and brush up,chesterton-ball
don t you understand that i did not dare to stop you,chesterton-ball
evan stood rooted upon the road literally like some heavy statue hewn there in the age of the druids,chesterton-ball
but turnbull was now something more dreadful than an enemy he was a thing sealed and devoted a thing now hopelessly doomed to be either a corpse or an executioner,chesterton-ball
but the honour of this earth has just this about it that it can make a man s heart like iron,chesterton-ball
she has hurt herself so that we might do it,chesterton-ball
the mere sight of them made the two wanderers flee as from a too frightful incongruity and before they knew where they were they were well upon the grassy ledge of england that overlooks the channel,chesterton-ball
if that s the view you take said turnbull and i don t say you are wrong i think i know where we shall be best off for the business,chesterton-ball
all the colours were transparent,chesterton-ball
and now it is a blood red hand,chesterton-ball
life too of the more moving sort rose at the sun on every side of them,chesterton-ball
it was down this clamorous ladder of life that they went down to die,chesterton-ball
macian followed him round the corner and found himself in what was certainly an even finer fencing court of flat firm sand enclosed on three sides by white walls of rock and on the fourth by the green wall of the advancing sea,chesterton-ball
do you mind if i light a pipe,chesterton-ball
of course my dear fellow said the other and leapt up as lightly as a monkey,chesterton-ball
imaginative life had never so much crowded upon macian,chesterton-ball
both men saluted and iron rang upon iron,chesterton-ball
then he turned and looked back and saw heavy foam being shaken up to heaven about the base of cragness point,chesterton-ball
then he let them fall and said yes i know what it means and i think it is the fairest thing,chesterton-ball
oh you have got it right you have got it right,chesterton-ball
he had been at a loss to understand the almost ironical magnificence of all those teeming creatures and tropical colours and smells that smoked happily to heaven,chesterton-ball
turnbull,chesterton-ball
i ve only just thought of it cried evan brokenly,chesterton-ball
just you stand up and fight and we ll see who will be washed away like seaweed,chesterton-ball
but just as turnbull launched his heaviest stroke the sea in which he stood up to his hips launched a yet heavier one,chesterton-ball
it seemed to him quite a cosmic collapse as if all the seven heavens were falling on him one after the other,chesterton-ball
then he saw that it was hardly the shape of any possible wave,chesterton-ball
then while taking no notice of the streams of salt water that were pouring from his hair beard coat boots and trousers he carefully wiped the wet off his sword blade to preserve it from the possibilities of rust,chesterton-ball
but it was piercingly cold and there was from time to time a splutter of rain like the splutter of the spray which seemed almost to freeze as it fell,chesterton-ball
on the top of the mound against the sky line stood up the brown skeleton of some broken fence or breakwater,chesterton-ball
their boots were beginning to break up and the confusion of stones tried them severely so that they were glad to lean on their swords as if they were the staves of pilgrims,chesterton-ball
macian put his hand to his head and found that his bonnet was not there,chesterton-ball
suddenly with a little cry he saw it and ran forward,chesterton-ball
cried turnbull waving his fragment we are safe at last,chesterton-ball
said the other looking at him heavily and with knitted brows like one almost dazed with the grey doubts of desolate twilight and drifting sea,chesterton-ball
there s an omen for you superstitious hill folk,chesterton-ball
said turnbull and all the rhetorical part of him came to the top his face growing as red as his hair,chesterton-ball
no said macian in a voice that shook with a controlled passion,chesterton-ball
france,chesterton-ball
france above all where men understand the pride and passion which have plucked our blades from their scabbards,chesterton-ball
turnbull glanced at the crucifix with a sort of scowling good humour and then said he may look and see his cross defeated,chesterton-ball
and while it was like a comic repetition of the cross it was also in that place and hour something more incredible,chesterton-ball
he was waving only one arm now and seemed to be shouting directions,chesterton-ball
he called out in a high shrill voice of authority like one who finds a tramp in his own larder,chesterton-ball
i m afraid sir said the sergeant with restraint i m afraid i don t quite follow you,chesterton-ball
not france,chesterton-ball
which reminds me to warn you that anything you say may be used against you at your trial,chesterton-ball
then macian finally awoke and leaving half his sleeve in the grip of the only man who tried to hold him took the two policemen in the small of their backs with the impetus of a cannon ball and sending them also flat among the stones went tearing after his twin defier of the law,chesterton-ball
one or two whitewashed cottages and even a shop had appeared along the side of the road,chesterton-ball
said macian innocently,chesterton-ball
he was quite unnoticeable but that was exactly where he was quite himself,chesterton-ball
he had a genius if one can even use so wild a word in connexion with so tame a person a genius for saying the conventional thing on every conceivable subject or rather what we in england would call the conventional thing,chesterton-ball
if you had asked him about government he would have said that all citizens were free and equal but he would have meant what he said,chesterton-ball
but durand was anything but a fool he had read all the eighteenth century and could have defended his platitudes round every angle of eighteenth century argument,chesterton-ball
the art in his home contained nothing between the two extremes of hard meagre designs of greek heads and roman togas and on the other side a few very vulgar catholic images in the crudest colours these were mostly in his daughter s room,chesterton-ball
the logician is therefore driven back upon the assumption that she did it and that lends a sort of mysterious interest to her personality at the beginning,chesterton-ball
both of them had strength below the surface they were like quiet peasants owning enormous and unquarried mines,chesterton-ball
the daughter was called a devotee,chesterton-ball
the modern man asked doubtfully where all this silent energy went to,chesterton-ball
his name was camille bert and he was a commercial traveller who had only been in the island an idle week before he began to hover in the tracks of madeleine durand,chesterton-ball
but he went to mass with a simple exactitude that could not be mistaken for a pose or even for a vulgar fascination,chesterton-ball
among the accidental group of guests who had come to it at this season was a man whose nationality no one could fix and who bore the non committal name of count gregory,chesterton-ball
ye he was decidedly a handsome figure with his curled yellow hair and lean fastidious face and he wore a peculiar frock coat of bright turquoise blue with an unknown order pinned to it and he carried a huge and heavy cane,chesterton-ball
even durand was invisible instead of being merely reverentially remote and madeleine set forth through the patch of black forest alone,chesterton-ball
we are alone here he cried and you would be at my mercy only that i am at yours,chesterton-ball
it is as well that you should know the worst and the best,chesterton-ball
he seized her suddenly by the elbow and she did not scream but only pulled and tugged,chesterton-ball
now she was startled with a new sanity for the tall man in the yellow whiskers and yellow moustache first returned the blow of bert as if it were a sort of duty and then stepped back with a slight bow and an easy smile,chesterton-ball
we are detaining the lady said count gregory with politeness and making a gesture suggesting that he would have taken off his hat if he had had one he strode away up the avenue of trees and eventually disappeared,chesterton-ball
he went out himself into the darkness walking sturdily but tearing at his black beard,chesterton-ball
at least there was only one member of it who seemed to be restless and that was she who was commonly most restful,chesterton-ball
i want to talk to you about what you are going to do,chesterton-ball
no one has ever hit me and if they had i should not feel as a man may,chesterton-ball
i m awfully stupid but i know that men like you aren t murderers,chesterton-ball
i thought that as you always go to church i thought you would communicate this morning,chesterton-ball
i know nothing about when you ought to die,chesterton-ball
his dark black hair and beard looked utterly unnatural against the startling pallor of his face,chesterton-ball
the truth interesting only to anthropologists is that he said it in scotch,chesterton-ball
then it was that bert exploded with a brutality which might have come from count gregory his criminal opponent,chesterton-ball
and i am the dirtiest and most dishonest,chesterton-ball
cried the man and i tell you god is a lie and a fable and a mask,chesterton-ball
he had been plucking fiercely at his black beard and hair all the time now he suddenly plucked them off and flung them like moulted feathers in the mire,chesterton-ball
it s just like my damned luck,chesterton-ball
evan macian said there was a god went on the other stubbornly and i say there isn t,chesterton-ball
i want you to be sick when you think of my name,chesterton-ball
oh i will say anything that can madden you,chesterton-ball
she said,chesterton-ball
but the startled pain of his face was strong enough to obliterate the oddity,chesterton-ball
and then you throw off your wig and throw up your scheme and throw over your colleague because i ask you to go into a building and eat a bit of bread,chesterton-ball
this has got beyond any talking,chesterton-ball
the man was in his woollen undershirt but turnbull knew the energetic apologetic head of the sergeant of police,chesterton-ball
the prompt reply of count gregory was to pull off his large yellow whiskers and scatter them on the breeze with an air of considerable relief,chesterton-ball
in any case they got used to the notion of the road being clear and just as they had come to the cliffs macian banged into another gentleman with unmistakable surprise,chesterton-ball
the nearest expression of the type is that it either hits or apologizes and in this case both apologized,chesterton-ball
can t drink beer myself,chesterton-ball
no doubt you re right said macian and dashed past him in despair,chesterton-ball
evan pulled up abruptly and looked back at him,chesterton-ball
evan s mind went through a crisis of instantaneous casuistry in which it may be that he decided wrongly but about how he decided his biographer can profess no doubt,chesterton-ball
neither of them had the smallest qualification for managing such a vessel but macian had a practical knowledge of the sea in much smaller and quite different boats while turnbull had an abstract knowledge of science and some of its applications to navigation which was worse,chesterton-ball
but they felt certain at least that they were far enough into that awful gulf between us and america to make it unlikely that they would soon see land again,chesterton-ball
i thought you were fond of legends and lies and fables said turnbull grimly,chesterton-ball
there seemed to be nothing in particular at least on this side of the island except shoals of shellfish lying so thick as almost to make it look like one of those toy grottos that the children make,chesterton-ball
i don t know why we re doing all this i suppose we ought really to fall to and get it over,chesterton-ball
what on earth are you talking about,chesterton-ball
what are you thinking,chesterton-ball
yes and there is something else said macian with slight hesitation,chesterton-ball
inquired the other puffing at his cigar,chesterton-ball
the unique island and the endless sea emphasized the thing solely as an epic,chesterton-ball
we will fight up here turnbull said macian when the time comes,chesterton-ball
then they came down and lunched plentifully in a nest of loose rocks,chesterton-ball
they wrote their records and cast loose their bottle,chesterton-ball
he had not even troubled to throw a glance round the island or the horizon,chesterton-ball
in fact it exhibited the extraordinary feature of not being an island at all,chesterton-ball
we ve butted the bally continent of america,chesterton-ball
i do not want to stop now said the other in his elephantine simplicity but we must stop for a moment because it is a sign perhaps it is a miracle,chesterton-ball
by the time they had walked for about half an hour in the ups and downs of those dreary sands the distance between the two had lengthened and macian was only a tall figure silhouetted for an instant upon the crest of some sand dune and then disappearing behind it,chesterton-ball
it was nothing less than the notorious mr evan macian coming bounding back across the sand heaps breathless without his cap and keeping the sword in his hand only by a habit now quite hardened,chesterton-ball
no said macian stopping and breathing hard i mean a savage,chesterton-ball
he put up his black head and grinned at me,chesterton-ball
shout if you get into trouble said the celt with composure you will find it as i say,chesterton-ball
it looked as if he were wounded or still more as if he were ill,chesterton-ball
and he went off again into convulsions of his humorous ailment,chesterton-ball
i saw the splendid barbarian chief,chesterton-ball
then he had a momentary return of his hysteria and said i say old boy i should like to see a chart of our fortnight s cruise in wilkinson s yacht,chesterton-ball
the bottle containing our declaration doctrines and dying sentiments was washed up on margate beach yesterday in the presence of one alderman two bathing machine men three policemen seven doctors and a hundred and thirteen london clerks on a holiday to all of whom whether directly or indirectly our composition gave enormous literary pleasure,chesterton-ball
this is not to be borne,chesterton-ball
up to this instant evan macian had really understood nothing but when he saw the policeman he saw everything,chesterton-ball
by the time he had scaled it thrice slid down twice and crested it in the third effort the two flying figures were far in front,chesterton-ball
they ran a mile or two farther along the edge of the wood until they reached another and somewhat similar opening,chesterton-ball
then he said the best place we can go to is to bed,chesterton-ball
indeed he needed the strongest sleep he could get for the earth was still full of darkness and a kind of morning fog when his fellow fugitive shook him awake,chesterton-ball
the next moment however he had jumped up alive and leaping like a man struck with a shock of cold water and he was plunging after macian along the woodland path,chesterton-ball
the empty road along which the chase had taken its turn was overshadowed on one side by a very high discoloured wall stained and streaked green as with seaweed evidently the high shouldered sentinel of some great gentleman s estate,chesterton-ball
a hundred and fifty yards behind them down the centre of the empty road the first of their pursuers came pounding and panting a fat but powerful policeman who had distanced all the rest,chesterton-ball
pursuer and pursued were fixed in their distance as they fled for some quarter of a mile when they came to a place where two or three of the trees grew twistedly together making a special obscurity,chesterton-ball
but higher yet behind them and readier to catch the first coming of the sun ran the rampart of the top of the wall which in their excitement of escape looked at once indispensable and unattainable like the wall of heaven,chesterton-ball
he had the quaint thought that he and turnbull were two knights on one steed on the old shield of the templars,chesterton-ball
they had alighted in the middle of a very broad garden path and the clearing mist permitted them to see the edge of a well clipped lawn,chesterton-ball
and yet the mere whiteness of the syringa seemed the most violent colour of all,chesterton-ball
down the centre of the central garden path preceded by a blue cloud from a cigarette was walking a gentleman who evidently understood all the relish of a garden in the very early morning,chesterton-ball
it needed the full shock of the huge shadow of macian falling across his sunlit path to rouse him from his smiling reverie,chesterton-ball
macian bowed,chesterton-ball
repeated the smiling old gentleman still without letting his surprise come uppermost,chesterton-ball
yes answered the old gentleman looking at him with a steady smile,chesterton-ball
the smile of the large proprietor broadened for a moment under his loose light moustache and the other continued with increased confidence,chesterton-ball
what do you want to fight about,chesterton-ball
even macian therefore whose tact was far from being his strong point felt the necessity for some compromise in the mode of approach,chesterton-ball
he queried in a key completely new,chesterton-ball
this young gentleman from the highlands happens to think that it s his business,chesterton-ball
the police with characteristic unreasonableness will not accept either of our proposals the result is that we run about dodging the police and have jumped over our garden wall into your magnificent garden to throw ourselves on your magnificent hospitality,chesterton-ball
yes by,chesterton-ball
and he went stamping up and down the garden making it echo with his unintelligible laughter,chesterton-ball
why i am god,chesterton-ball
answered the other thoroughly amused,chesterton-ball
you ve seen him dance,chesterton-ball
said the man on one leg nodding gravely,chesterton-ball
so do the sun and stars,chesterton-ball
then he looked at macian,chesterton-ball
the man with the good hat and the jumping elbow went by very quickly yet the man with the bad hat who thought he was god overtook him,chesterton-ball
of course you won t trust him much come to me for everything,chesterton-ball
your own royal position and my much humbler one surely indicate us as the proper seconds,chesterton-ball
they have come to the right place,chesterton-ball
there was a long stillness and their eyes involuntarily took in the landscape as they had taken in all the landscapes of their everlasting combat the bright square garden behind the shop the whole lift and leaning of the side of hampstead heath the little garden of the decadent choked with flowers the square of sand beside the sea at sunrise,chesterton-ball
don t believe the story he tells you about why i hate him,chesterton-ball
all the rationalist and plain man revolted within him against bowing down for a moment in that forest of deception and egotistical darkness,chesterton-ball
shall we say the atmosphere,chesterton-ball
do you know who i am,chesterton-ball
yes cried turnbull advancing on him swiftly and with animated gestures why does teething hurt,chesterton-ball
why is the horn on the top of the nose,chesterton-ball
you make a million worlds and only one seems inhabited,chesterton-ball
a man died yesterday in ealing,chesterton-ball
you scuttled their ship,chesterton-ball
he likes the people who wear crowns whether of diamonds or of stars,chesterton-ball
but i dislike more and i deny more the divine right of divinity,chesterton-ball
i am king edward vii he said with shaky arrogance,chesterton-ball
turnbull swung round on his heel,chesterton-ball
i alone am loyal insisted macian for i alone am in rebellion,chesterton-ball
who made you whose fathers could not splutter english while they walked in whitehall who made you the judge between the republic of sidney and the monarchy of montrose,chesterton-ball
what good have you ever done to us,chesterton-ball
bad pictures and bad manners and pantheism and the albert memorial,chesterton-ball
the other two remained in the centre of the lawn turnbull in convulsions of laughter the lunatic in convulsions of disgust,chesterton-ball
it performed almost all his gestures it was more important than the glittering eye glasses through which he looked or the beautiful bleating voice in which he spoke,chesterton-ball
it spoils one s temper so much,chesterton-ball
the new comer started slightly and turnbull replied to the question on his face,chesterton-ball
macian was sitting somewhat disconsolately on a stump of tree his large black head half buried in his large brown hands when turnbull strode up to him chewing a cigarette,chesterton-ball
oh,chesterton-ball
for one instant macian opened the eyes of battle then his tightened lips took a crooked smile and he said quite calmly,chesterton-ball
does it make much odds,chesterton-ball
why are you always wanting to humble a man,chesterton-ball
that was an extreme case of impudence said turnbull,chesterton-ball
well said turnbull sitting down on the grass this is a digression anyhow,chesterton-ball
but i bet there are many more who are simply mad on madness,chesterton-ball
all the same said turnbull shrewdly i bet you haven t found a madman of that sort,chesterton-ball
talk about believing one is god why it s quite an old comfortable fireside fancy compared with the sort of things this fellow believes,chesterton-ball
what can he have meant,chesterton-ball
oh dear,chesterton-ball
turnbull leapt to his feet as by an electric shock,chesterton-ball
but he doesn t exist,chesterton-ball
why you great donkey he shouted in an ear shattering whisper that s not one of the patients at all,chesterton-ball
evan was still staring back curiously at the beaming and bearded creature behind him,chesterton-ball
this is the very time he appointed to talk with us about our well our exeat,chesterton-ball
jackass,chesterton-ball
if there s half an hour of inquiry we are cooked,chesterton-ball
i hope i do not hurry you gentlemen he said with the faintest suggestion of a sneer at their hurried consultation but i believe you wanted to see me at half past eleven,chesterton-ball
if you really want to put anything before me i can give you a few moments in my consulting room,chesterton-ball
the doctor sat down with a polite impatience on his professional perch macian remained standing but turnbull threw himself almost with luxury into a hard wooden arm chair,chesterton-ball
said the doctor mildly,chesterton-ball
in that case said turnbull rising genially we must not further interrupt your important duties,chesterton-ball
why of course not said the beaming scientist think how dangerous that would be in a place like this,chesterton-ball
and with that the man of the world was struck dumb and as in all intolerable moments the word was with the unworldly,chesterton-ball
you know nothing about us,chesterton-ball
the doctor got languidly to his feet,chesterton-ball
the first three words were in such large copy book hand that they caught the eye even at a distance,chesterton-ball
mother carried bone of st eulalia with which she touched children in sickness,chesterton-ball
oh,chesterton-ball
i will pay the penalty of having enjoyed god in this monstrous modern earth that cannot enjoy man or beast,chesterton-ball
his ancestor i am certain did not die at culloden,chesterton-ball
hitherto turnbull himself had somewhat scornfully surrendered his part in the whole business but he was too honest and unaffected not to start at his own name,chesterton-ball
turnbull slammed the case to almost smashing it and said with a burst of savage laughter oh,chesterton-ball
asked evan,chesterton-ball
they saw us get in right enough,chesterton-ball
the system of espionage in the asylum was so effective and complete that in practice the patients could often enjoy a sense of almost complete solitude,chesterton-ball
evidently apollo is to the full as poetical as diana but it is not a question of poetry in the matured and intellectual sense of the word,chesterton-ball
it was at least some such infantile facts and fancies which led evan again and again during his dehumanized imprisonment to go out as if to shoot the moon,chesterton-ball
it jerked awkwardly up and down in a way unknown among meteors and strangely reminiscent of the works of man,chesterton-ball
the simile of such virginity is not inappropriate for as it grew larger and larger and lower and lower evan saw that the only figure in it was robed in white from head to foot and crowned with snow white hair on which the moonshine lay like a benediction,chesterton-ball
asked the young man accepting the monstrous event with a queer and clumsy naturalness what is my sword wanted for,chesterton-ball
and the next moment was seized by a sort of choking terror lest his question should be answered,chesterton-ball
his strong well opened eyes were very brilliant but quite colourless like steel,chesterton-ball
evan did not ask for or require any explanation,chesterton-ball
some stars are big and some small some stand still and some circle around them as they stand,chesterton-ball
the earth will be as beautiful as the heavens because our kings have come back to us,chesterton-ball
it is all that was ever lost by insolence and overwhelmed in rebellion,chesterton-ball
it is arthur overwhelmed in lyonesse by heathen armies and dying in the mist doubtful if ever he shall return,chesterton-ball
asked macian,chesterton-ball
asked evan,chesterton-ball
it seemed that it was really newly covered with silver which in the strong moonlight was like white flame,chesterton-ball
the dome had been redecorated so as to give it a more solemn and somewhat more ecclesiastical note the ball was draped or destroyed and round the gallery under the cross ran what looked like a ring of silver statues like the little leaden images that stood round the hat of louis xi,chesterton-ball
for he could imagine nothing that so echoed his own visions of pontifical or chivalric art as this white dome sitting like a vast silver tiara over london ringed with a triple crown of swords,chesterton-ball
only in one place at the corner of bouverie street did there appear to be a moment s confusion and that was due to hurry rather than resistance,chesterton-ball
discipline is not so important as justice said macian,chesterton-ball
evan who was also leaning over the edge swung round with startling suddenness and stared at the other s back,chesterton-ball
the other seemed to take no notice but reverted to the main topic,chesterton-ball
besides continued he in the prow you must allow for a certain high spirit and haughtiness in the superior type,chesterton-ball
why you great fool,chesterton-ball
but i saw on your mouth the twitch of your infernal sophistry i knew that something was wrong with you and your cathedrals,chesterton-ball
that is unfortunate said the other in a quiet but hard voice because you are going to see his majesty,chesterton-ball
to whom do you appeal,chesterton-ball
and how do you know he said how do you know that i am not god,chesterton-ball
you are not god,chesterton-ball
the dream of turnbull,chesterton-ball
it was his head that was his hobby,chesterton-ball
and so strong and pitiless was the wind that it whipped away fragments of red flowering bushes or of copper beech and drove them also across the garden a drift of red leaves like the leaves of autumn as in parody of the red and driven rags of cloud,chesterton-ball
turnbull continued to stare at it and in a little time occurred that crucial instant when a thing however incredible is accepted as a fact,chesterton-ball
while our friend stood frozen for an instant by his astonishment the queer figure in the airy car tipped the vehicle almost upside down by leaping over the side of it seemed to slide or drop down the rope like a monkey and alighted with impossible precision and placidity seated on the edge of the wall over which he kicked and dangled his legs as he grinned at turnbull,chesterton-ball
stiffening in himself the masculine but mirthless courage of the atheist he drew a little nearer to the wall and catching the man at a slightly different angle of the evening light could see his face and figure quite plain,chesterton-ball
another was that under the mop of white and senile hair the face was strong handsome and smiling with a well cut profile and a long cloven chin,chesterton-ball
the only three facts that turnbull could now add to his inventory were that the man had an ugly looking knife swinging at his trousers belt that his brown feet were as bare as his bronzed trunk and arms and that his eyes had a singular bleak brilliancy which was of no particular colour,chesterton-ball
what do you want,chesterton-ball
i want the revolution,chesterton-ball
to some cause he could never explain he found himself completing the sentence on the top of the wall having automatically followed the stranger so far,chesterton-ball
all the great rebels have been very little rebels said the man with the red scarf,chesterton-ball
asked turnbull,chesterton-ball
but the clear colours of the plan were growing darker every moment,chesterton-ball
below them the fallen lights were literally the fallen stars of servitude,chesterton-ball
then as turnbull made no answer his host continued,chesterton-ball
that is the only glory of this universe it is a giddy universe,chesterton-ball
and all the people who think they are condescending find they are climbing up a precipice,chesterton-ball
so macian converted you,chesterton-ball
i have known him for a month and i have not retracted a single,chesterton-ball
i am still an atheist,chesterton-ball
the other continued still unruffled and staring over the edge idly as an angler stares down at a stream,chesterton-ball
what does all this mean and what do you want with me here,chesterton-ball
the man laid himself back in his reposeful attitude and said,chesterton-ball
still i do not see said turnbull stubbornly,chesterton-ball
then only he cared to look down into the streets and saw that they were inflamed with uproar and tossing passions,chesterton-ball
yes replied the other,chesterton-ball
the higher and higher it rose the broader and broader became the scenes of flame and desolation underneath,chesterton-ball
have the people really risen,chesterton-ball
turnbull wrinkled his forehead,chesterton-ball
there were certainly a few districts in fact we are passing over them just now,chesterton-ball
i mean the three celebrated sentences no man should be unemployed,chesterton-ball
you see these people were much too tired and weak even to join the social war,chesterton-ball
will you permit me to say said turnbull after reflection that i don t like all this,chesterton-ball
rights,chesterton-ball
i understood you to say that you thought life sacred,chesterton-ball
we are improving life by removing lives,chesterton-ball
it really comes to this you approve of taking away life from those to whom it is a triumph and a pleasure,chesterton-ball
he cried but new lives for old,chesterton-ball
he said quite calmly like on stopping an omnibus,chesterton-ball
i have heard about your revolutionary war and i think on the whole that i would rather be anywhere else,chesterton-ball
asked the unknown,chesterton-ball
at last he said very gravely do you think i am the devil,chesterton-ball
i say as a fact of dogma and faith that it is all a nightmare,chesterton-ball
when he again realized anything he was lying on his elbow on the lawn of the lunatic asylum and the last red of the sunset had not yet disappeared,chesterton-ball
the two men came slowly towards each other and found the same expression on each other s faces,chesterton-ball
will you come inside please,chesterton-ball
i will be plain with you gentlemen he said abruptly you know quite well we do our best for everybody here,chesterton-ball
the doctor answered looking at his desk and playing with a key well in certain cases that give anxiety it is often better,chesterton-ball
they take it in good temper walk and talk in your garden like monks who have found a vocation are civil even to you you damned druggists hack,chesterton-ball
i won t take it from you,chesterton-ball
the tall highlander bending over him put one hand on his shoulder with fatherly interest,chesterton-ball
dr quayle got to his feet in a mixture of sudden hysteria and clumsy presence of mind,chesterton-ball
when a voice said come in macian s breath went hissing back through his teeth into his chest,chesterton-ball
it was only for a flash that his face was thus lifted,chesterton-ball
the instant they stepped out into the corridor four sturdy figures stepped from four sides pinioned them and ran them along the galleries,chesterton-ball
only the fact that windows grew fewer coming at longer intervals and the fact that when the windows did come they seemed shadowed and let in less light showed that they were winding into the core or belly of some enormous building,chesterton-ball
you go in here sir said the leader of the officials quite respectfully and you in here,chesterton-ball
he was hidden and sealed up in this little crack of stone until the flesh should fall off his bones,chesterton-ball
on the same principle a row of fixed holes quite close together let in to the cells by pipes what was alleged to be the freshest air,chesterton-ball
they had not entertained the suggestion that the open air is only one of the advantages of the open sky,chesterton-ball
turnbull s solitary soul surged up against this sickening daily solemnity,chesterton-ball
every morning and evening an iron hatchway opened in his oblong cell and a brown hairy hand or two thrust in a plate of perfectly cooked lentils and a big bowl of cocoa,chesterton-ball
it was a long narrow parallelogram which had a flat wall at one end and ought to have had a flat wall at the other but that end was broken by a wedge or angle of space like the prow of a ship,chesterton-ball
then he became quite cool and stupid again and began to examine it like a sort of robinson crusoe,chesterton-ball
this he rent open and instantly saw a light behind it was at least certain that he had struck some other cell,chesterton-ball
but it does it with the permanent possibility that the men may some day be more afraid of their enemies than of their officers,chesterton-ball
turnbull was not long in discovering this truth in connexion with the cold and colossal machinery of this great asylum,chesterton-ball
this also passed but left behind it a feverish distaste for many of the mere objects around him,chesterton-ball
he no more expected rescue from a medical certificate than rescue from the solar system,chesterton-ball
in the old filthy dungeons men could carve their prayers or protests in the rock,chesterton-ball
then james turnbull looked up and saw the high invincible hatefulness of the society in which he lived and saw the hatefulness of something else also which he told himself again and again was not the cosmos in which he believed,chesterton-ball
as he was screwing his eye to peer at this grey and greasy twilight he was astonished to see another human finger very long and lean come down from above towards the broken pipe and hook it up to something higher,chesterton-ball
i say turnbull we couldn t fight through this tube could we,chesterton-ball
for a mortal month i have been alone with god,chesterton-ball
oh no said macian and his voice shuddered it was a great deal too exciting,chesterton-ball
perhaps my brain really has gone but i detest that iron spike in the left wall more than the damned desolation or the damned cocoa,chesterton-ball
i pulled it out the other day when i was off my head continued the tranquil highland voice,chesterton-ball
but i ve found out something a long sight funnier,chesterton-ball
by that time the two captives had fully discovered and demonstrated that weakness in the very nature of modern machinery to which we have already referred,chesterton-ball
but for this macian s cell was the duplicate of turnbull s a long oblong ending in a wedge and lined with cold and lustrous tiles,chesterton-ball
macian answered briefly another cell,chesterton-ball
the notion of the doorless room chilled him with that sense of half witted curiosity which one has when something horrible is half understood,chesterton-ball
a cold and quivering impatience continued to crawl up turnbull s spine he had never felt so near to superstition and supernaturalism and it was not a pretty sort of superstition either,chesterton-ball
i have looked through the hole at him but i cannot stand looking at him long because his face is turned away from me and he does not move,chesterton-ball
the figure was draped both insecurely and insufficiently in what looked like the remains of a brown flannel dressing gown an emptied cup of cocoa stood on the floor beside it and the creature had his big grey head cocked at a particular angle of inquiry or attention which amid all that gathering gloom and mystery struck one as comic if not cocksure,chesterton-ball
the lines of his face were so deep and complex that one could see five or ten different faces besides the real one as one can see them in an elaborate wall paper,chesterton-ball
and then he waited for this dwarfish voice that had been hidden under the mountains of the world,chesterton-ball
he had grown to tolerate those dreary and mumbling madmen who trailed themselves about the beautiful asylum gardens,chesterton-ball
yes said the old man nodding a great many times and beaming like a flattered landlord,chesterton-ball
squares very good i have a nice long holiday and can count them,chesterton-ball
the words turnbull spoke broke out of him in pure pity,chesterton-ball
can i help you,chesterton-ball
good day,chesterton-ball
his brain s like a pin point now,chesterton-ball
he had a notion that he could help us said macian moodily and began to pace towards the other end of his cell,chesterton-ball
said macian,chesterton-ball
come along you fool,chesterton-ball
all the same said evan like one answering in an ordinary conversation he did ask you whether he could help you,chesterton-ball
they were looking in at one of the seven gates of eden,chesterton-ball
a riddle of faces,chesterton-ball
you don t suppose i should have let these lunatics out of their cells without good reason,chesterton-ball
let them take the wings of the morning and abide in the uttermost parts of the sea i am there,chesterton-ball
said turnbull stepping forward with a respectful resolution,chesterton-ball
the small doctor smiled and turnbull s anger seemed suddenly to steady him,chesterton-ball
why did the master lock us up in a couple of cupboards like jars of pickles for a mortal month and why does he now let us walk free in the garden again,chesterton-ball
what are those arrangements,chesterton-ball
you were shut up just then because it was just during that month that the master was bringing off his big scheme,chesterton-ball
there s a new law now and the asylum powers are greatly extended,chesterton-ball
we have therefore reversed the existing method and people now have to prove that they are sane,chesterton-ball
the doctor showed his whole row of teeth in a smile,chesterton-ball
but,chesterton-ball
macian who had not spoken yet made one stride forward and stood with shaking limbs and shining eyes,chesterton-ball
then he added in a low but not inaudible voice except one whom he feared worse and has buried deeper,chesterton-ball
why should all england have gone dotty on the mere subject of dottiness,chesterton-ball
from behind the two black coated doctors as they stood on the lawn another figure somewhat similarly dressed strode hurriedly past them having also grizzled hair and an open flapping frock coat,chesterton-ball
turnbull could not remember any particular doctors in his decidedly healthy existence,chesterton-ball
turnbull s heart gave a leap of excitement which was half hope,chesterton-ball
a tall fellow mcsomething case made rather a noise afterwards,chesterton-ball
has he got anything to do with this game,chesterton-ball
my influence,chesterton-ball
cumberland vane exploded with a detonation of oaths his face was transfigured with fury and contempt and yet in some odd way he did not seem specially angry with turnbull,chesterton-ball
you,chesterton-ball
but he fortunately remembered the remains of his desperate diplomacy,chesterton-ball
asked turnbull,chesterton-ball
what put the country into such a state,chesterton-ball
why should you be surprised at my fighting,chesterton-ball
did you,chesterton-ball
or it seemed as if this ironic paradise still kept its unique dawn or its special sunset while the rest of the earthly globe rolled through its ordinary hours,chesterton-ball
a white early moon was hardly traceable upon that delicate yellow,chesterton-ball
that particular run and tumble is typical only of a man who has been hit by some sudden and incurable evil who is bitten by a viper or condemned to be hanged,chesterton-ball
they are right they are right,chesterton-ball
he went on with shapeless fluency as if he no longer had the heart to choose or check his speech,chesterton-ball
macian shook his head,chesterton-ball
macian lowered his voice,chesterton-ball
my dear fellow cried turnbull rallying a hearty laugh the fancies have really got hold of you,chesterton-ball
turnbull murmured some clumsy deprecation and sat stolidly smoking to collect his thoughts the next instant he had all his nerves engaged in the mere effort to sit still,chesterton-ball
cried macian with a leap of eagerness that was heart breaking do you see her too,chesterton-ball
he could stand it no longer but ran across to the path turned the corner and saw standing quite palpable in the evening sunlight talking with a casual grace to turnbull the face and figure which had filled his midnights with frightfully vivid or desperately half forgotten features,chesterton-ball
but macian was in a condition of criticism much less than the average masculine one being in fact merely overturned by the rushing riddle of the events,chesterton-ball
i m a lunatic,chesterton-ball
the young woman broke again into one of the maddening and mysterious laughs of femininity,chesterton-ball
quite so answered the inexplicable lady nodding with a perfectly blazing smile and i am locked up because it was to me you promised,chesterton-ball
he was quite sure now that he himself was not mad and the fact rather added to his perplexity,chesterton-ball
the pure lemon of the sky faded into purer white as the great sunset silently collapsed,chesterton-ball
the ostensible cause of his removal was the unexpected reappearance of his two other acquaintances walking and talking laboriously along the way with the black head bent close to the brown one,chesterton-ball
when they parted at the head of the walk she put out her hand again in the same well bred way although it trembled he seemed to restrain a gesture as he let it fall,chesterton-ball
after that we belong to each other,chesterton-ball
xix,chesterton-ball
almost sobbed the young man who was in the highest spirits,chesterton-ball
the young man sat down on the gravel path and went into ecstasies of laughter,chesterton-ball
the tall man sitting on the gravel bowed with urbanity and said quite at your service,chesterton-ball
well the fact is began turnbull again and then the phrase was frozen on his mouth for round the corner came the goatlike face and gleaming eye glasses of dr quayle,chesterton-ball
i am sure mr wilkinson will excuse us a moment,chesterton-ball
it s very sad and i m afraid utterly incurable,chesterton-ball
i know i know said the psychologist mournfully it is a most melancholy case and also fortunately a very rare one,chesterton-ball
the man really did lose a ship,chesterton-ball
under the first laburnum tree he stopped however and pulling out his pencil and notebook wrote down feverishly singular development in the elenthero maniac turnbull,chesterton-ball
he found macian stalking moodily about the half lit garden after his extraordinary meeting with beatrice,chesterton-ball
macian stepped back a little and the soul in his eyes came very slowly to its windows,chesterton-ball
are you hurt turnbull,chesterton-ball
macian did not answer and he continued with asperity you are still thinking about that girl but i tell you the whole thing is incredible,chesterton-ball
one never meets such old friends again except in a dream,chesterton-ball
no you good atheist he cried no you clean courteous reverent pious old blasphemer,chesterton-ball
i say this is not a dream said evan in a ringing voice,chesterton-ball
an apocalypse is the opposite of a dream,chesterton-ball
everything is coming to a point,chesterton-ball
turnbull three days ago i saw quite suddenly that our duel was not right after all,chesterton-ball
old man in the cell,chesterton-ball
it would have been a venial sin,chesterton-ball
i would confess it to old cumberland vane and his eye glass,chesterton-ball
then he went on,chesterton-ball
all england has turned into a lunatic asylum in order to prove us lunatics,chesterton-ball
the church has had her madnesses and i am one of them,chesterton-ball
but your modern nietzsche will tell you that massacre would be glorious without a provocation,chesterton-ball
which is madder the russian priest who discourages righteous rebellion or the russian novelist who forbids it,chesterton-ball
i believe we are the sanest,chesterton-ball
cut the world loose he cried with a savage gesture,chesterton-ball
it has been the sorrow of your life,chesterton-ball
the world takes the trouble to make a big mistake about every little mistake made by the church,chesterton-ball
turnbull for the first time started,chesterton-ball
i had a dream said macian in which i saw the cross erect and the ball invisible,chesterton-ball
they beat the old world about like a bladder and thump it into a thousand shapeless shapes,chesterton-ball
murmured macian,chesterton-ball
it does not much matter what you call it he said so long as you keep out of its way,chesterton-ball
his voice was for the first time devoid of irony,chesterton-ball
ah,chesterton-ball
xx,chesterton-ball
this silent declaration of war had evidently had its complete effect,chesterton-ball
she looked straight at him with a steady smile which lit up the scene of darkness and unreason like the light of some honest fireside,chesterton-ball
there was the tipsy old hertfordshire rustic he was talking energetically to himself,chesterton-ball
he stepped impulsively forward towards madeleine and then wavered with a kind of wild humility,chesterton-ball
cried turnbull to himself if is in the asylum there can t be anyone outside,chesterton-ball
handsome as he looked they had never seen so clearly what was really hateful in his face and even then they could only express it by saying that the arched brows and the long emphatic chin gave it always a look of being lit from below like the face of some infernal actor,chesterton-ball
it was a steady monotonous vivacity which came not seemingly from passion but merely from the reason having been sent off at a gallop,chesterton-ball
you now forbid me the promenade a thing necessary to a person of my age,chesterton-ball
the place is covered with machine guns,chesterton-ball
oh,chesterton-ball
to whom shall i specially address myself,chesterton-ball
turnbull growled something which was presumably assent,chesterton-ball
now within our own time there arose an unfortunate fuss which threatened as mr turnbull would say to galvanize the corpse of christianity into a fictitious life the alleged case of a highland eccentric who wanted to fight for the virgin,chesterton-ball
working men who betted on the duel were imprisoned for gambling,chesterton-ball
there never was any man named macian,chesterton-ball
he is a victim of the disease called vinculomania the impression that one has been bound or tied up,chesterton-ball
madeleine durand actually professes to have been the subject of the fight between macian and his enemy a fight which if it occurred at all certainly began long before,chesterton-ball
his two lieutenants quayle and hutton were left standing at the head of the great army of servants and keepers,chesterton-ball
twenty attendants rushed to capture the rebels macian flung back three of them and turnbull went over on top of one when from behind them all came a shriek as of something quite fresh and frightful,chesterton-ball
oh who can have done it,chesterton-ball
oh how should i know,chesterton-ball
but macian had taken a stride forward and stood there shaken and terrible,chesterton-ball
how do you know we shall go,chesterton-ball
you think the doctors will go said hutton savagely,chesterton-ball
this is a successful revolution,chesterton-ball
long after they had clambered into the car the creature with the cloven face continued to leer down upon the smoke stung crowd below,chesterton-ball
once i mislaid him on the cross of st paul s,chesterton-ball
turnbull looked once at madeleine and followed,chesterton-ball
their incessant shrieking and crackling was like a mob shouting against an orator,chesterton-ball
listen,chesterton-ball
repeated turnbull grimly,chesterton-ball
in the heart of that white hot hell he was singing like a bird,chesterton-ball
are you cut off,chesterton-ball
fool come out and save yourself,chesterton-ball
the fire though it had dropped in one or two places was upon the whole higher and more unconquerable than ever,chesterton-ball
it was literally a wall of fire,chesterton-ball
if any villagers or sailors were looking towards it they must have seen a strange sight as macian cried out for the third time,chesterton-ball
for while one half of the huge fire sloped one way towards the inland heights the other half at exactly the same angle sloped out eastward towards the sea,chesterton-ball
when james turnbull saw this he suddenly put out a hand and seemed to support himself on the strong shoulder of madeleine durand,chesterton-ball
but he was unlike the writers in the magazines precisely in this that he preferred a fact even to materialism,chesterton-ball
while the first light of the fire had shot east and west painting the sides of ships with fire light or striking red sparks out of windowed houses it had not hitherto struck upward for there was above it the ponderous and rococo cavern of its own monstrous coloured smoke,chesterton-ball
as they stared upward the little speck of light seemed slightly tilted and two black dots dropped from the edge of it,chesterton-ball
they are gone,chesterton-ball
no they are not lost he said,chesterton-ball

these things were there in their place but one felt that they were never allowed out of their place,chesterton-brown
one could not say the books were never read probably they were but there was a sense of their being chained to their places like the bibles in the old churches,chesterton-brown
everything about him and his room indicated something at once rigid and restless like that great northern sea by which on pure principles of hygiene he had built his home,chesterton-brown
the new comer regarded the doctor with that beaming but breathless geniality which characterizes a corpulent charwoman who has just managed to stuff herself into an omnibus,chesterton-brown
i ve come about that business of the macnabs,chesterton-brown
i fear you have mistaken the chambers,chesterton-brown
and he leaned back in his chair in radiant rationality,chesterton-brown
now what can be more important than that,chesterton-brown
well mr brown i am a sportsman,chesterton-brown
the little clergyman called brown thanked him with unquestionable warmth but still with a queer kind of simplicity,chesterton-brown
she has one daughter and she lets lodgings and between her and the daughter and between her and the lodgers well i dare say there is a great deal to be said on both sides,chesterton-brown
it is indeed a hideous enigma said dr hood,chesterton-brown
the dynamite must be of a shy and noiseless sort for the poor fellow only shuts himself up for several hours of the day and studies something behind a locked door,chesterton-brown
there are tales of a mysterious tall man in a silk hat who once came out of the sea mists and apparently out of the sea stepping softly across the sandy fields and through the small back garden at twilight till he was heard talking to the lodger at his open window,chesterton-brown
and yet there is the little fellow in his respectable black jacket as punctual and innocent as a parlour clock,chesterton-brown
even in a minute instance it is best to look first to the main tendencies of nature,chesterton-brown
there is no stronger case than that of the wild unworldly and perishing stock which we commonly call the celts of whom your friends the macnabs are specimens,chesterton-brown
he sees thousands of mrs macnabs in thousands of houses dropping their little drop of morbidity in the tea cups of their friends he sees,chesterton-brown
father brown began to get to his feet in some disorder,chesterton-brown
two separate voices for james speaks low with a burr and the other voice was high and quavery,chesterton-brown
they were quarrelling about money i think for i heard james say again and again that s right mr glass or no mr glass and then two or three mr glass,chesterton-brown
i tried to break down the door and couldn t answered the girl shortly then i ran to the back yard and managed to climb on to the window sill that looks into the room,chesterton-brown
as i have nothing else to do i will put on my hat and stroll down town with you,chesterton-brown
the doctor and the priest made scant reply to her shrill reiterations of her daughter s story with more disturbing details of her own to the divided vows of vengeance against mr glass for murdering and against mr todhunter for being murdered or against the latter for having dared to want to marry her daughter and for not having lived to do it,chesterton-brown
two wine glasses stood ready for wine on a side table but a third lay smashed in a star of crystal upon the carpet,chesterton-brown
dr orion hood paused for one instant on the doormat and drank in the whole scene of voiceless violence,chesterton-brown
for mr glass is not a careless man with his clothes,chesterton-brown
i say old with intention though not with certainty continued the expositor my reason for it might seem a little far fetched,chesterton-brown
i might rely in some degree on the story of his previous appearance at the window as a tall man in a silk hat but i think i have more exact indication,chesterton-brown
i may say at once that it is possible that the man glass was bald or nervous through dissipation rather than age,chesterton-brown
what then were these vessels to contain,chesterton-brown
father brown i seriously ask you to compose your flock for their sakes not for mine,chesterton-brown
we have the two typical figures of a tragedy of hush money on the one hand the respectable man with a mystery on the other the west end vulture with a scent for a mystery,chesterton-brown
he studied him intently even moving him a little and half turning him round by the shoulders but he only answered,chesterton-brown
there are four objections to this first why should a gentleman so dressy as our friend glass leave his hat behind him if he left of his own free will,chesterton-brown
it is much more likely that the blackmailed person would try to kill his incubus rather than that the blackmailer would try to kill the goose that lays his golden egg,chesterton-brown
miss macnab very much wanted to know why i did not set mr todhunter free from his ropes,chesterton-brown
i have looked at all the knots on mr todhunter reiterated hood quietly,chesterton-brown
one could almost fancy they were sea monsters like krakens or cuttlefish writhing polypi who had crawled up from the sea to see the end of this tragedy even as he the villain and victim of it the terrible man in the tall hat had once crawled up from the sea,chesterton-brown
say it again please he said in a simple bothered manner do you mean that todhunter can tie himself up all alone and untie himself all alone,chesterton-brown
then he turned his own rather fatuous face to the company,chesterton-brown
both the professor and the girl followed the direction of his glance,chesterton-brown
but i should interpret those transverse wrinkles as expressing rather such slight psychological abnormality,chesterton-brown
well replied the reverend brown apologetically not to put too fine a point on it i think he is laughing at you,chesterton-brown
he shuffled about the room looking at one object after another with what seemed to be a vacant stare and then invariably bursting into an equally vacant laugh a highly irritating process for those who had to watch it,chesterton-brown
how much more godlike that is than if you had only ferreted out the mere facts,chesterton-brown
that s it that s it said the little priest nodding quite eagerly that s the first idea to get fixed the absence of mr glass,chesterton-brown
i mean he is absent from everywhere answered father brown he is absent from the nature of things so to speak,chesterton-brown
well he said before we go on to the hundred and one other evidences let us take the first proof we found the first fact we fell over when we fell into this room,chesterton-brown
father brown shook his head with ineffable mildness,chesterton-brown
asked the criminologist with a slight sneer,chesterton-brown
what,chesterton-brown
mr todhunter hasn t got a scratch on him as you say but he s got a scratch in him if you follow me,chesterton-brown
well what in the name of bedlam do you mean,chesterton-brown
but being only at the stage of practice he smashed one glass against the ceiling,chesterton-brown
the cards of course are for card tricks and they are scattered on the floor because he had just been practising one of those dodges of sending them flying through the air,chesterton-brown
have you never heard a ventriloquist,chesterton-brown
but there is just one part of mr glass you have not succeeded in explaining away and that is his name,chesterton-brown
when our juggling friend here threw up the three glasses in turn he counted them aloud as he caught them and also commented aloud when he failed to catch them,chesterton-brown
then advancing into the middle of the room with a bow he produced from his pocket a big bill printed in blue and red which announced that zaladin the world s greatest conjurer contortionist ventriloquist and human kangaroo would be ready with an entirely new series of tricks at the empire pavilion scarborough on monday next at eight o clock precisely,chesterton-brown
muscari had an eagle nose like dante his hair and neckerchief were dark and flowing he carried a black cloak and might almost have carried a black mask so much did he bear with him a sort of venetian melodrama,chesterton-brown
his poetry was as straightforward as anyone else s prose,chesterton-brown
the restaurant was glittering but still comparatively empty,chesterton-brown
but as the cockney apparition drew nearer muscari was astounded to observe that the head was distinctly different from the body,chesterton-brown
muscari had known him last behind the footlights he was but too well attuned to the excitements of that profession and it was believed that some moral calamity had swallowed him up,chesterton-brown
in that case remarked muscari i confess i prefer the italian of the past,chesterton-brown
you cannot make italians really progressive they are too intelligent,chesterton-brown
cried muscari laughing,chesterton-brown
inquired the poet with some eagerness,chesterton-brown
but i am a rather curious sort of courier,chesterton-brown
but you daren t say you can t say that he s cleverer than i or bolder than i or even more energetic,chesterton-brown
to be clever enough to get all that money one must be stupid enough to want it,chesterton-brown
he carried several unopened letters in his hand,chesterton-brown
ezza studied her with a gaze equally intense and far more baffling,chesterton-brown
the danger was not from rock and avalanche but from something yet more romantic,chesterton-brown
montano the king of thieves was first heard of in the mountains some ten years ago when people said brigands were extinct,chesterton-brown
but the courier thought it perfectly safe,chesterton-brown
it can never be utterly stamped out muscari answered because armed revolt is a recreation natural to southerners,chesterton-brown
believe me there is no more danger of being captured in italy than of being scalped in boston,chesterton-brown
muscari threw back his black mane,chesterton-brown
the shorter priest turned and walked towards the banker s son and the latter was astonished to realize that though a roman priest the man was an englishman,chesterton-brown
the odd thing i have to say will come far better from a stranger,chesterton-brown
one is never thinking of the real sorrow said the strange priest,chesterton-brown
a more surprising feature was the appearance at the coast town station of the little priest of the restaurant he alleged merely that business led him also to cross the mountains of the midland,chesterton-brown
he had planted his person at a flying leap next to the lovely englishwoman on the other side of her sat the priest whose name was brown and who was fortunately a silent individual the courier and the father and son were on the banc behind,chesterton-brown
the fields were burnished in sun and wind with the colour of kingfisher and parrot and humming bird the hues of a hundred flowering flowers,chesterton-brown
it s like kew gardens on beachy head said ethel,chesterton-brown
it is never your fault answered muscari it was not your fault that troy fell,chesterton-brown
it was just enough to alter the equilibrium the whole coach heeled over like a ship and crashed through the fringe of bushes over the cliff,chesterton-brown
in the first flash it looked as wild as suicide but in the second it was as sensible as a safe investment,chesterton-brown
the wrecked coach still hung above entangled in the tough hedge and the horses plunged painfully down the slope,chesterton-brown
on the other side of him the grass partly hid miss ethel s sunshade and just beyond it lay a curious little glass bottle hardly two inches long,chesterton-brown
he slipped it into his own waistcoat pocket,chesterton-brown
after all he thought perhaps the poison isn t hers perhaps it s one of muscari s melodramatic tricks,chesterton-brown
the poet asked him who he was and he did not answer,chesterton-brown
this was a trap,chesterton-brown
then put the lady in the middle and we will break the line up there with a rush,chesterton-brown
i have been acting epics while you have been writing them,chesterton-brown
i call myself montano cried the strange courier in a voice equally loud and full,chesterton-brown
it is my principal stronghold on these hills for as you have doubtless noticed the eyrie is invisible both from the road above and from the valley below,chesterton-brown
thank god,chesterton-brown
it only remains for me he said to explain to my guests the social conditions upon which i have the pleasure of entertaining them,chesterton-brown
he paused with an unpleasing smile and father brown blinked repeatedly at him and seemed suddenly to be listening with great attention,chesterton-brown
i suggest that mr harrogate senior should now give me the two thousand pounds in his pocket,chesterton-brown
excellent,chesterton-brown
who would not pay triple this sum for another day s association with such a domestic circle,chesterton-brown
he slapped his sword back in the scabbard and went and flung himself somewhat sulkily on one of the green banks,chesterton-brown
what do you mean,chesterton-brown
but in what way,chesterton-brown
i should like to have your opinion on them,chesterton-brown
on the impulse of the moment i warned her brother that she might be in peril i said nothing of its nature for i did not know,chesterton-brown
disaster to miss harrogate,chesterton-brown
why did he put so prominently in his demand for ransom the fact that he had taken two thousand pounds from his victim on the spot,chesterton-brown
why should ezza montano want so specially to tell all europe that he had picked the pocket before he levied the blackmail,chesterton-brown
why does our brigand courier call this his chief fortress and the paradise of thieves,chesterton-brown
i think it would be the worst fortress in the world,chesterton-brown
it is something else it has some other strange sort of importance some value that i do not understand,chesterton-brown
he was a strange figure as he stood there for he had assumed a flapped fantastic hat and swinging baldric and cutlass in his capacity of bandit king but the bright prosaic tweed of the courier showed through in patches all over him,chesterton-brown
the brigands swayed and huddled cursing and whispering and the evening air was full of little metallic noises as they cocked their pistols or loosened their knives or trailed their scabbards over the stones,chesterton-brown
now to be rebels against robbers,chesterton-brown
frank harrogate jumped up and ran across to help him revolver in hand but was astounded to hear himself imperatively recalled by the raucous voice of his father who seemed to be in great agitation,chesterton-brown
we must submit to our lot,chesterton-brown
what s the good old man,chesterton-brown
everything about me is a sham responded the ex courier in complete good humour,chesterton-brown
darkness was deepening under the mountain walls and it was not easy to discern much of the progress of the struggle save that tall men were pushing their horses muzzles through a clinging crowd of brigands who seemed more inclined to harass and hustle the invaders than to kill them,chesterton-brown
you will permit me the impertinent intimacy but do you care about that girl,chesterton-brown
then go over there and offer yourself said the priest offer her everything you can offer her heaven and earth if you ve got them,chesterton-brown
nothing is coming up the road argued muscari except the rescue,chesterton-brown
there was a momentary silence broken in an extraordinary way by the banker who cried out in a hoarse and strangled voice robbed,chesterton-brown
encountering the king of the thieves in his path he clapped him on the shoulder with something between a caress and a buffet and gave him a push that sent him staggering away,chesterton-brown
then flinging up his hands he leapt exactly as he leapt out of the coach,chesterton-brown
this last trick of his i believe to be absolutely unprecedented,chesterton-brown
muscari was leading away the unhappy daughter who held hard to him as she did for many a year after,chesterton-brown
didn t i tell you i was a futurist,chesterton-brown
iii,chesterton-brown
m brun had a dark wedge of beard apparently affixed under his lower lip,chesterton-brown
m brun had become prominent by his proposal that the common expression adieu should be obliterated from all the french classics and a slight fine imposed for its use in private life,chesterton-brown
and indeed it was in this regard that the two men differed most from their leader and father in philosophy,chesterton-brown
but he was neither an anarchist nor an antipatriot his views on disarmament were moderate and evolutionary the republican government put considerable confidence in him as to various chemical improvements,chesterton-brown
the door was opened to them by the doctor s old servant simon who might very well have passed for a doctor himself having a strict suit of black spectacles grey hair and a confidential manner,chesterton-brown
there is a man in this house whom i refuse to meet,chesterton-brown
i will try to send him over to you,chesterton-brown
p hirsch,chesterton-brown
maurice brun cleared his throat and said of course we must help the master in every way but,chesterton-brown
the man s shoulders were big and broad but his legs were neat and active in knee breeches and knitted stockings,chesterton-brown
his french however was obviously that of a native and his french patriotism was so impulsive as to be slightly absurd,chesterton-brown
with the prompt french instinct for the politics of the street the man with the black moustache had already run across to a corner of the cafe sprung on one of the tables and seizing a branch of chestnut to steady himself shouted as camille desmoulins once shouted when he scattered the oak leaves among the populace,chesterton-brown
silent as he is when i beat on his bedroom door,chesterton-brown
betrayed at this moment,chesterton-brown
it is in his hand,chesterton-brown
tell the man the formula for powder is in grey envelope in first drawer to the left of secretary s desk war office in red ink,chesterton-brown
if this is a military secret shouted brun why do you yell about it in the street,chesterton-brown
he refuses to explain,chesterton-brown
every instant the human sea grew wider and wider it surged up against the rails and steps of the traitor s house it was already certain that the place would be burst into like the bastille when the broken french window opened and dr hirsch came out on the balcony,chesterton-brown
livid as he was he spoke with a sort of prim decision so that the mob fell silent in the middle of his third sentence,chesterton-brown
and i will tell you why,chesterton-brown
but our own most precious truth is the fundamental force of matter and heredity,chesterton-brown
two men were instantly found in the crowd itself to offer their services to colonel dubosc who came out presently satisfied,chesterton-brown
though unroofed by any glass or gilt plaster the guests were nearly all under a delicate and irregular roof of leaves for the ornamental trees stood so thick around and among the tables as to give something of the dimness and the dazzle of a small orchard,chesterton-brown
i m afraid i must chuck this business said he heavily,chesterton-brown
that s just the odd thing replied flambeau,chesterton-brown
you mean the information is wrong,chesterton-brown
after that we really can t support dubosc if his revelation is a mare s nest,chesterton-brown
it says the paper is in the cupboard on the right of the secretary s desk,chesterton-brown
i think we must chuck it up and apologize to old carrots,chesterton-brown
the grey envelope it was a white envelope really was,chesterton-brown
repeated flambeau eating heartily,chesterton-brown
hang it all it might as well have been grey,chesterton-brown
the note is utterly wrong about the facts,chesterton-brown
do you mean,chesterton-brown
i say if you found a house where the door was blue and the blind green where there was a back garden and no front garden where cats were common and dogs instantly shot where tea was drunk in quarts and coffee forbidden then you would know you had found the house,chesterton-brown
as long as it was only the left drawer instead of the right and red ink instead of black i thought it must be the chance blunders of a forger as you say,chesterton-brown
what was it then,chesterton-brown
i can always grasp moral evidence easier than the other sorts,chesterton-brown
i don t mean the political parties the rank and file are always roughly honest and often duped,chesterton-brown
now dreyfus went on like a man who knew he was a wronged man,chesterton-brown
and what has it to do with old hirsch,chesterton-brown
the better part of him what was left of it would still say i have not helped the enemy i said it was the left drawer,chesterton-brown
i wasn t thinking of dreyfus said father brown,chesterton-brown
it s not entirely their fault but they have no instincts,chesterton-brown
father brown continued to consume whitebait,chesterton-brown
you don t doubt him,chesterton-brown
there is something in this business quite different from the ordinary police mystery where one man is more or less lying and the other man more or less telling the truth,chesterton-brown
if all you can suggest is that notion of a message conveyed by contraries i call it uncommonly clever but well what would you call it,chesterton-brown
there are only three versions dubosc s and hirsch s and that fancy of mine,chesterton-brown
but this thing s elaborately simple like a penny dreadful in the purple grotto you will find the golden casket,chesterton-brown
he is packing up to leave the country and he asks us to make his excuses sur le terrain,chesterton-brown
but what can this mean,chesterton-brown
i believe it s some plot,chesterton-brown
brown said nothing but finished his plate of fish,chesterton-brown
will he be there still do you think,chesterton-brown
but we may still be in time to catch him if we go there in a motor cab,chesterton-brown
all paris will cheer him now our cursed colonel has turned tail,chesterton-brown
the lane down which they followed him was one of those that seem to be at the back of things and look like the wrong side of the stage scenery,chesterton-brown
do you know he said there is something about this place that,chesterton-brown
he s only gone into one of these garden doors and as he spoke they heard one of the dull wooden doors close again with a click in front of them,chesterton-brown
he is escaping from everywhere answered father brown,chesterton-brown
a kind of cry came from flambeau on the wall above,chesterton-brown
cried the duke smiting his hip,chesterton-brown
a red blind had been pulled down over the light but pulled crookedly so that it gaped on one side and by risking his neck along a branch that looked as treacherous as a twig flambeau could just see colonel dubosc walking about in a brilliantly lighted and luxurious bedroom,chesterton-brown
have you read a queer psychological story by henry james of two persons who so perpetually missed meeting each other by accident that they began to feel quite frightened of each other and to think it was fate,chesterton-brown
if god almighty held the truncheon of the lists if st michael blew the trumpet for the swords to cross even then if one of them stood ready the other would not come,chesterton-brown
they cancel out so to speak,chesterton-brown
in his shirt and trousers he was a comparatively slim gentleman who walked across the bedroom to the bathroom with no more pugnacious purpose than that of washing himself,chesterton-brown
it is all just like what i was saying to flambeau,chesterton-brown
one of these men is fair and the other dark one stout and the other slim one strong and the other weak,chesterton-brown
wherever the one sticks out the other sinks in,chesterton-brown
for a spasm flambeau saw the fierce red brown eyes dancing then they were covered with a pair of blue spectacles,chesterton-brown
two men appeared simultaneously at the two ends of a sort of passage running along the side of the apollo theatre in the adelphi,chesterton-brown
one side of the passage was a blank wall for the building it supported was an old unsuccessful theatre restaurant now shut up,chesterton-brown
not however with equal speed but the man who walked fast was the man from the other end of the tunnel so they both arrived before the secret stage door almost at the same instant,chesterton-brown
but everything about them from their glory to their good looks was of a diverse and incomparable kind,chesterton-brown
he was so unique that nobody could quite decide whether he was a great aristocrat who had taken up art or a great artist whom the aristocrats had taken up,chesterton-brown
his hair was silver grey but he did not look old it was worn longer than the common yet he did not look effeminate it was curly but it did not look curled,chesterton-brown
his military moustache and the carriage of his shoulders showed him a soldier but he had a pair of those peculiar frank and piercing blue eyes which are more common in sailors,chesterton-brown
you could not get away from hearing of him wherever you were his portrait was on every other postcard his maps and battles in every other illustrated paper songs in his honour in every other music hall turn or on every other barrel organ,chesterton-brown
it was fitted and filled with looking glasses at every angle of refraction so that they looked like the hundred facets of one huge diamond if one could get inside a diamond,chesterton-brown
in about half a minute however the inner door opened and she entered as she always did even in private life so that the very silence seemed to be a roar of applause and one well deserved,chesterton-brown
she greeted both men with the beaming and baffling smile which kept so many males at the same just dangerous distance from her,chesterton-brown
he had really been attracted to it by the leaf like shape it was as perfect as a greek vase,chesterton-brown
his vivid black eyes rolled volcanically his bronzed face handsome as it was showed at that moment a combination of high cheekbones with set white teeth which recalled certain american conjectures about his origin in the southern plantations,chesterton-brown
a shrewd observer might have remarked that the emotional temperature rather rose at so unemotional an interruption,chesterton-brown
it was evident that the great aurora though by no means indifferent to the admiration of the other sex wanted at this moment to get rid of all the men who admired her and be left alone with the man who did not did not admire her in that sense at least for the little priest did admire and even enjoy the firm feminine diplomacy with which she set about her task,chesterton-brown
he would ignore all hints but he would die rather than ignore a definite commission from a lady,chesterton-brown
but they won t be complete you know without my favourite flower,chesterton-brown
but meanwhile miss rome s experiment in mobilizing the british army had not succeeded so simply as seemed probable,chesterton-brown
yet a second or two after seymour s brow darkened again,chesterton-brown
every time he pulled out the frame of a new glass a new black figure of father brown appeared the absurd glass chamber was full of father browns upside down in the air like angels turning somersaults like acrobats turning their backs to everybody like very rude persons,chesterton-brown
who s that man in the passage,chesterton-brown
he was still grotesquely grasping a bunch of lilies of the valley,chesterton-brown
my tricks,chesterton-brown
my name is brown said the priest sadly as he bent over something and straightened himself again,chesterton-brown
her dress was torn away as in a struggle leaving the right shoulder bare but the wound from which the blood was welling was on the other side,chesterton-brown
you need not kill me he said in a voice quite cold i shall do that on my own account,chesterton-brown
as he did so old parkinson tottered in his wavering way out of the door and caught sight of the corpse lying in the passage,chesterton-brown
the idea that the great national hero of the hour had arrested a wrongdoer with his own hand doubtless had its weight with the police who are not without elements of the journalist,chesterton-brown
said the constable confidentially to cutler,chesterton-brown
he also had paid his tribute not without eloquence to the woman who had died,chesterton-brown
he s just dead,chesterton-brown
like the white tail of a rabbit he had the vanishing thought that he was certain of their grief but not so certain of their innocence,chesterton-brown
i would not add to your troubles if it weren t common justice to warn you,chesterton-brown
hurt myself,chesterton-brown
and so we shall never know whether there was blood on it before,chesterton-brown
as modern newspapers are conducted the most honest and most important news is the police news,chesterton-brown
the victim was a popular actress the accused was a popular actor and the accused had been caught red handed as it were by the most popular soldier of the patriotic season,chesterton-brown
the medical evidence involved no contradictions the doctor whom seymour had summoned on the spot agreeing with the eminent surgeon who had later examined the body,chesterton-brown
some official detective evidence followed chiefly concerned with the presence or absence of any proof of a struggle the only suggestion of this was the tearing of the dress at the shoulder and this did not seem to fit in particularly well with the direction and finality of the blow,chesterton-brown
he had been calling on miss rome at the theatre he had met captain cutler there they had been joined for a short time by the accused who had then returned to his own dressing room they had then been joined by a roman catholic priest who asked for the deceased lady and said his name was brown,chesterton-brown
yes he saw something in the passage,chesterton-brown
the passage is of such length that anyone in the middle of it appears quite black against the light at the other end,chesterton-brown
not in the least answered seymour quietly,chesterton-brown
tall as bruno was to the eye he seemed to swell taller and taller when an eyes had been torn away from him,chesterton-brown
a faint refined smile seemed to pass over seymour s features,chesterton-brown
he repeated slowly,chesterton-brown
and it had something that looked like long hair,chesterton-brown
asked about its outline he said he was no art critic with a somewhat too obvious sneer at seymour,chesterton-brown
what do you mean by saying that it looked more like a beast than a man or a woman,chesterton-brown
a woman s,chesterton-brown
no,chesterton-brown
the third witness called by sir walter cowdray was the little catholic clergyman so little compared with the others that his head seemed hardly to come above the box so that it was like cross examining a child,chesterton-brown
and you say you saw the black shape,chesterton-brown
the devil with horns no doubt ejaculated cowdray sitting down in triumphant jocularity,chesterton-brown
and the figure in the passage described by three capable and respectable men who had all seen it was a shifting nightmare one called it a woman and the other a beast and the other a devil,chesterton-brown
butler k c sprang to his feet in an extraordinary stillness and said quite calmly your lordship will allow me to cross examine,chesterton-brown
spears have short blades,chesterton-brown
but the judge still looked at him with bright and steady eyes of interest and the counsel for the defence went on with his questions unperturbed,chesterton-brown
she struggled to free herself and as she did so parkinson came out of the prisoner s room and lunged with the spear,chesterton-brown
there was another vast and unnatural silence and this time it was the judge who spoke,chesterton-brown
and you mean to say that when captain cutler saw that chimpanzee with humped shoulders and hog s bristles he simply saw himself,chesterton-brown
v the mistake of the machine,chesterton-brown
what do you think of it,chesterton-brown
blood will have to flow very funnily blood will have to flow up the matterhorn before i will take it as a sign that i am to shed it,chesterton-brown
why they must be as sentimental as a man who thinks a woman is in love with him if she blushes,chesterton-brown
why the other end of the stick always points the opposite way,chesterton-brown
the official second in command under the governor was an ex detective named greywood usher a cadaverous careful spoken yankee philosopher occasionally varying a very rigid visage with an odd apologetic grimace,chesterton-brown
it appeared to be an extract from one of the pinkest of american society papers and ran as follows,chesterton-brown
this would be all the more telling as hospitable todd is entertaining in lord falconroy the famous traveller a true blooded aristocrat fresh from england s oak groves,chesterton-brown
i cannot think at this moment of anything in this world that would interest me less,chesterton-brown
the paragraph was headed savage murder of a warder,chesterton-brown
he was only temporarily detained for some comparatively trivial assault but he gave everyone the impression of a man with a black past and a dangerous future,chesterton-brown
well the literary style is somewhat improved admitted the priest cheerfully but still i don t see what i can do for you,chesterton-brown
he isn t in any hole said the governor he isn t up any tree,chesterton-brown
father brown opened his innocent eyes wide,chesterton-brown
i got hold of him with the crooked end of a walking stick,chesterton-brown
he appeared to be much exhausted but when he came to the thick black hedge he went through it as if it were made of spiders webs or rather for i heard the strong branches breaking and snapping like bayonets as if he himself were made of stone,chesterton-brown
we soon found out who he was but i had guessed it with the first glint of the moon on him,chesterton-brown
there were more decisive details to a fairly well trained eye,chesterton-brown
then i remembered that beyond these ploughed fields he was crossing lay pilgrim s pond for which you will remember the convict was keeping his bullet and i sent my walking stick flying,chesterton-brown
well that is possible enough answered the priest,chesterton-brown
you will notice that these two cuttings have only one thing in common which is the mention of pilgrim s pond the estate as you know of the millionaire ireton todd,chesterton-brown
anyhow said usher last trick todd counts for a great deal in this rum affair,chesterton-brown
last trick todd has made himself big by his own considerable abilities and there s no doubt that many of those on whom he has shown his abilities would like to show theirs on him with a shot gun,chesterton-brown
when i had my prisoner safe i picked up my cane again and strolled down the two or three turns of country road that brought me to one of the side entrances of todd s grounds the one nearest to the pool or lake after which the place is named,chesterton-brown
i crouched behind the fence which ran not more than two hundred yards from one wing of the great mansion and which was fortunately split in places as if specially for the application of a cautious eye,chesterton-brown
as she swung it the second time a flicker of its light fell for a moment on her own face a face that i knew,chesterton-brown
a window was thrown up in one of the upper floors but just round the corner of the house so that i could not see it and a voice of terrible distinctness was heard shouting across the dark garden to know where lord falconroy was for he was missing from every room in the house,chesterton-brown
and shut down the window violently and i could hear him plunging down the stairs inside,chesterton-brown
let us suppose then that our friend with the cropped hair came to kill falconroy and not todd,chesterton-brown
it sounds to you like saying the archbishop of canterbury s daughter will be married in st george s hanover square to a crossing sweeper on ticket of leave,chesterton-brown
you don t allow for our national buoyancy and uplift,chesterton-brown
well said the priest patiently and what did you do next,chesterton-brown
it did in this case as i ll show you went on usher positively,chesterton-brown
isn t that better evidence than a lot of gabble from witnesses if the evidence of a reliable machine,chesterton-brown
i don t want to be rude and i don t think you will consider man to be an offensive or inaccurate description of yourself,chesterton-brown
there was no machine tied on to your pulse,chesterton-brown
oh you make me tired,chesterton-brown
usher smote the table and rose in a sort of angry triumph,chesterton-brown
there was really nothing against the man at all,chesterton-brown
he was silent and dignified as they are he seemed to have a big but buried grievance as they do,chesterton-brown
by the time i came with him out of the private room into the vestibule where all sorts of other people were awaiting examination i think he had already more or less made up his mind to clear things up by something like a confession,chesterton-brown
her lean finger seemed to pick him out as if it were a pea shooter,chesterton-brown
among the wretched women mostly thieves and streetwalkers twenty faces were turned gaping with glee and hate,chesterton-brown
but he was never entirely fixed for it curiously enough because he did it in the same manner as those milder or meaner crimes for which he was fixed pretty often,chesterton-brown
well there is your innocent man and there is his innocent record,chesterton-brown
as to what you ve done for him replied father brown rising and shaking himself in a floppy way you ve saved him from the electrical chair,chesterton-brown
why should he be innocent of that crime,chesterton-brown
you talk as if a miser on monday were always a spendthrift on tuesday,chesterton-brown
he didn t write on the wall with his own hand to say he had done it,chesterton-brown
saints alive,chesterton-brown
the door flew open,chesterton-brown
mr usher prided himself on having seen most of the roughest specimens in the state but he thought he had never seen such a baboon dressed as a scarecrow as this,chesterton-brown
keep him here for a split instant and you ll feel pretty mean,chesterton-brown
while the bell was still strong and pealing the voice of father brown fell soft but distinct,chesterton-brown
i reckon the cosmos is cracked said usher and fell asprawl in his round office chair,chesterton-brown
yelled usher suddenly sitting up straight,chesterton-brown
mr ireton todd is a good host and has tracked him here without even waiting to take off his fancy dress,chesterton-brown
do you seriously mean began the official,chesterton-brown
then why the blazes didn t he say so,chesterton-brown
the priest looked at him very earnestly but with a baffling and undecipherable face,chesterton-brown
davis and falconroy are both pretty considerable cowards but so are lots of other men,chesterton-brown
you don t allow for our national buoyancy and uplift,chesterton-brown
cried todd brutally,chesterton-brown
the paragraph went on a laughable occurrence took place outside wilkinson s motor garage last night,chesterton-brown
she had arranged freak dinner,chesterton-brown
there is somewhere in brompton or kensington an interminable avenue of tall houses rich but largely empty that looks like a terrace of tombs,chesterton-brown
there is something cheery in its very dinginess and something free and elfin in its very insignificance,chesterton-brown
they were sitting at a small table close up to the window when the priest pulled the curtain back and looked out,chesterton-brown
flambeau looked up in surprise but the girl with the red hair also looked up and with something that was stronger than astonishment,chesterton-brown
i haven t a notion answered father brown,chesterton-brown
father brown took a small book out of his pocket and began to read steadily he betrayed no consciousness of the fact that the red haired lady had left her own table and sat down opposite him,chesterton-brown
the young woman s eyes followed his and rested there also but in pure puzzledom,chesterton-brown
what does it matter what it says,chesterton-brown
well,chesterton-brown
not to trouble you about it he replied very gently,chesterton-brown
this street is the only original long lane that has no turning and the houses on both sides are shut up,chesterton-brown
i didn t think he could,chesterton-brown
she looked back at him for some time with a heated face in which there hung a red shadow of anger then despite her anxieties humour broke out of her eyes and the corners of her mouth and she answered almost grimly well if you re so keen on my conversation perhaps you ll answer my question,chesterton-brown
i don t say it s the sort of nose one would wear out of mere foppery he admitted,chesterton-brown
observed brown absent mindedly,chesterton-brown
but i think you could tell me more about that than i can tell you,chesterton-brown
i will tell you everything said the red haired girl doggedly except why i am telling you and that i don t know,chesterton-brown
he was prouder of his collection than of his coat of arms nobody could say more than that,chesterton-brown
he meant it as a reward as the highest honour he could offer in acknowledgement of arthur s loyalty and rectitude and the distinctions he had already gained in mathematics and economics at cambridge,chesterton-brown
he acted as if roman money must be guarded by all the roman virtues,chesterton-brown
now if you ve known any young people you won t be shocked if i say that i got into rather a low frame of mind with all this the frame of mind in which one begins to say that the ancient romans were all very well in their way,chesterton-brown
i come now to the silly part of the story,chesterton-brown
we used to go shrimping together and said and thought we were in love with each other at least he certainly said he was and i certainly thought i was,chesterton-brown
then i suddenly remembered giles telling philip of a coin that was like him and philip wishing he had it,chesterton-brown
i believe my brother could see me burned like a witch for such a thing but then the very thought of such fanatical cruelty heightened my old hatred of his dingy old antiquarian fussiness and my longing for the youth and liberty that called to me from the sea,chesterton-brown
as i ran down the streets to the sea the coin clenched tight in my fist i felt all the roman empire on my back as well as the carstairs pedigree,chesterton-brown
we were quite alone in a circle of sea water and wet sand and i gave him the head of caesar,chesterton-brown
as he drew nearer and nearer i saw that he was dark and bearded and that his eyes were marked with dark spectacles,chesterton-brown
it was as if a house had flown up into the sky or a man s head had fallen off,chesterton-brown
the stranger came on till he stood within two yards of me the water washing half way up to his knees,chesterton-brown
his complexion was neither sallow nor livid but on the contrary rather clear and youthful yet this gave a pink and white wax look which somehow i don t know why rather increased the horror,chesterton-brown
i think it seemed as if he could move his nose like a finger,chesterton-brown
i had stolen the thing suddenly and on impulse i was certainly alone for i always made sure of being unobserved when i slipped out to see philip in this way,chesterton-brown
he merely said gruffly to the man you clear out of this,chesterton-brown
he turned suddenly saying go back,chesterton-brown
though as affectionate as ever he still seemed cast down and before i could ask him anything fully he parted with me at his own gate with two remarks that struck me as strange,chesterton-brown
but flambeau as he bowed and sat down handed the priest a small slip of paper,chesterton-brown
thus there was no one to help me in the house except my brother whose help must be my ruin,chesterton-brown
i sat at the drawing room window looking on to the garden which still glowed with the last full evening light,chesterton-brown
because though he cast a long evening shadow he still stood in warm sunlight,chesterton-brown
this renewed timidity on his part was so different from the impudence with which he had walked into the sea that i felt vaguely comforted,chesterton-brown
but when i stared harder it was more like a man s thumb pressed on the pane it had that curled look that a thumb has,chesterton-brown
but even as i passed i could swear i saw a second black window with something on it that was like a snail,chesterton-brown
my brother s chair was empty and he was obviously out,chesterton-brown
what i did next does matter i gave him all the money i had including a good deal in paper which though it was mine i dare say i had no right to touch,chesterton-brown
because the bargain might still misfire any moment he insisted on my packing at once and going up with him to lodgings he had already taken in fulham to be near the curio shop in question,chesterton-brown
but i still question with bursting brains how it can have happened,chesterton-brown
miss carstairs will you be at home if we call at your fulham place in an hour and a half hence,chesterton-brown
but i can t see how he can come into the thing by any process of thought unless,chesterton-brown
the australian chap did know that hawker wanted the coin,chesterton-brown
this hawker hears his love insulted but doesn t strike till he s got to the soft sand hills where he can be victor in a mere sham fight,chesterton-brown
you want one person for suicide two people for murder but at least three people for blackmail,chesterton-brown
three persons are needed as ideas,chesterton-brown
suppose a wife became a rigid teetotaller in order to frighten her husband into concealing his pub frequenting and then wrote him blackmailing letters in another hand threatening to tell his wife,chesterton-brown
cried flambeau you don t mean,chesterton-brown
yes said the young man in an undertone i guessed on the sands and now i know that was why i let him fall soft,chesterton-brown
and he handed it to the man with the nose,chesterton-brown
the man changed colour so horribly that the crooked nose stood out on his face like a separate and comic thing,chesterton-brown
shouted father brown bounding and half falling over a chair and after a wrench or two flambeau had the door open,chesterton-brown
the priest held up the bronze head of caesar,chesterton-brown
he blackmailed his brother from australia for his little forgotten crime that is why he took the cab to wagga wagga in putney he blackmailed his sister for the theft he alone could have noticed,chesterton-brown
is there so great a difference,chesterton-brown
vii,chesterton-brown
it might truly be said of him as for many journalists in authority that his most familiar emotion was one of continuous fear fear of libel actions fear of lost advertisements fear of misprints fear of the sack,chesterton-brown
dear nutt as i see you re working spooks and dooks at the same time what about an article on that rum business of the eyres of exmoor or as the old women call it down here the devil s ear of eyre,chesterton-brown
there was a lot of alleged witchcraft mixed up with it and the story goes that a man servant listening at the keyhole heard the truth in a talk between the king and carr and the bodily ear with which he heard grew large and monstrous as by magic so awful was the secret,chesterton-brown
and the ear is in it somehow i fancy either a symbol or a delusion or disease or something,chesterton-brown
i suggest a series of articles pointing out how dreary how inhuman how downright diabolist is the very smell and atmosphere of some of these great houses,chesterton-brown
this elaborate epistle he articulated as if it were all one word and miss barlow rattled it down as if it were all one word,chesterton-brown
then followed the legend of the ear amplified from finn s first letter and then the substance of his later discoveries as follows,chesterton-brown
he will use the real names of the parties who in most cases are ready to confirm his testimony,chesterton-brown
and at this table sat three gentlemen who might have lived a hundred years ago,chesterton-brown
it was only when i saw his broad curved hat lying on the table beside him that i realized why i connected him with anything ancient,chesterton-brown
but after all analysis i incline to think that what gave me my first old fashioned impression was simply a set of tall old fashioned wine glasses one or two lemons and two churchwarden pipes,chesterton-brown
i thought the subject seemed to embarrass the other two a little but it broke the spell of the third man s silence most successfully,chesterton-brown
and the little priest at the other end of the table though free from any such air of embarrassment looked steadily at the table and seemed to listen to the recital with great pain as well as he might,chesterton-brown
they know there are none who have suffered from it as i have,chesterton-brown
then he said at last don t you know who he is,chesterton-brown
he seems really to believe answered the priest called brown that they have left a curse on him,chesterton-brown
i ve heard of it of course but surely it must be a superstitious yarn spun out of something much simpler,chesterton-brown
no he groaned,chesterton-brown
he would fetch a man a mile to ring a bell a yard off if it would summon another man three miles to fetch a matchbox three yards off,chesterton-brown
he lets the whole world do everything for him except dress him,chesterton-brown
gentlemen the duke does really feel the bitterness about the curse that he uttered just now,chesterton-brown
i don t mind telling you father because it s really more defending the poor duke than giving him away,chesterton-brown
instead of using funds he held in trust he took advantage of the duke s carelessness to put the family in a financial hole in which it might be necessary for the duke to let him hold them in reality,chesterton-brown
it left a red triangular scar on the scalp and the lawyer s eyes altered but not his smile,chesterton-brown
the law will give it you he said but you will not take it why not,chesterton-brown
but mull swears it is the solemn fact that the lawyer after shaking his knotted fists in the air for an instant simply ran from the room and never reappeared in the countryside and since then exmoor has been feared more for a warlock than even for a landlord and a magistrate,chesterton-brown
and i learnt from the legal records and old newspapers that there was a lawsuit threatened and at least begun by one green against the duke of exmoor,chesterton-brown
e nutt,chesterton-brown
i venture to say without any vanity that the words i now write will be read all over europe and certainly all over america and the colonies,chesterton-brown
what a lovely colour a lemon is,chesterton-brown
i can quite understand that it s nicer to cover them with hair than with brass plates or leather flaps,chesterton-brown
shall i tell you,chesterton-brown
i don t suggest you re either more snobbish or more morbid than the rest of us but don t you feel in a vague way that a genuine old family curse is rather a fine thing to have,chesterton-brown
i cried and that s true enough,chesterton-brown
the little man s voice changed so suddenly he shut his hand so sharply and his eyes so rapidly grew rounder and brighter like a waking owl s that it had all the abruptness of a small explosion on the table,chesterton-brown
the duke came round the corner and resumed his seat at the head of the table with all his native dignity,chesterton-brown
but i presume you would rather be heard in private,chesterton-brown
all over this country i have found hundreds even of my own faith and flock whose imaginations are poisoned by the spell which i implore you to break,chesterton-brown
the duke s face did not move but he looked at his petitioner with a glassy stare which was the most awful expression i have ever seen on a human face,chesterton-brown
i will spare you the hint,chesterton-brown
and i say to you wherever you find men ruled merely by mystery it is the mystery of iniquity,chesterton-brown
if i did said the duke in a low voice you and all you believe and all by which alone you live would be the first to shrivel and perish,chesterton-brown
your grace i cried i call your bluff,chesterton-brown
i admit that whilst wrestling i shut my eyes as it fell,chesterton-brown
his ears are just like everybody else s,chesterton-brown
he said politely and he did get the whole estate after all,chesterton-brown
he really is the one and only duke of exmoor,chesterton-brown
green pressed his claim and got the estates the dispossessed nobleman shot himself and died without issue,chesterton-brown
mr nutt put down the manuscript and called out with unusual sharpness miss barlow please take down a letter to mr finn,chesterton-brown
why sir simon is one of exmoor s greatest pals and it would ruin that cousin of the eyres that s standing for us at bradford,chesterton-brown
do be reasonable yours e nutt,chesterton-brown
he had lately fallen ill with over work and when he began to recover his friend flambeau had taken him on a cruise in a small yacht with sir cecil fanshaw a young cornish squire and an enthusiast for cornish coast scenery,chesterton-brown
when flambeau asked whether this rocky gate of the twisted river was not the gate of fairyland he said yes,chesterton-brown
and he heard fanshaw say to flambeau that oddly enough it didn t mean this it meant that while they saw two of the coast lights one near and the other distant exactly side by side they were in the right river channel but that if one light was hidden behind the other they were going on the rocks,chesterton-brown
he heard fanshaw say there was no need to be silly that not only had cornish captains been heroes but that they were heroes still that near that very spot there was an old admiral now retired who was scarred by thrilling voyages full of adventures and who had in his youth found the last group of eight pacific islands that was added to the chart of the world,chesterton-brown
for as the river mouth narrowed like the neck of a bottle and the water grew calmer and the air warmer and more earthly he seemed to wake up and take notice like a baby,chesterton-brown
this magic clearness and intensity in the colours was further forced on brown s slowly reviving senses by something romantic and even secret in the very form of the landscape,chesterton-brown
with the rate at which they went the islet seemed to swim towards them like a ship a ship with a very high prow or to speak more strictly a very high funnel,chesterton-brown
these black beams were set crooked or crisscross at all kinds of angles giving the whole a most patchy and puzzling appearance,chesterton-brown
he was sure he had seen timbers of different tints arranged like that somewhere but never in such architectural proportions,chesterton-brown
what on earth s this,chesterton-brown
now you shall see whether i exaggerate about the mariners of cornwall,chesterton-brown
she d find a rum sort of thing in the garden said father brown which would not please her renaissance eye,chesterton-brown
for what other reason asked father brown do you mean that it has been rebuilt,chesterton-brown
but he was a man of flaming and tigerish temper and coming to high words with one of them he caught him by the throat and flung him by accident or design into the sea,chesterton-brown
with that he dived under the wave and was either drowned or swam so long under water that no hair of his head was seen afterwards,chesterton-brown
as you may easily suppose plenty of superstitions and scandals have followed in the track of the spaniard s curse and no doubt as you would put it any accident happening to this cornish family would be connected with it by rural credulity,chesterton-brown
when did your friend the admiral tell you this family history,chesterton-brown
they followed him on to the island just under the tower and father brown whether from the mere touch of dry land or the interest of something on the other bank of the river which he stared at very hard for some seconds seemed singularly improved in briskness,chesterton-brown
anyhow a mystical monotony was the only character of their march until fanshaw suddenly stopped and pointed to something sticking out through the grey fence something that looked at first rather like the imprisoned horn of some beast,chesterton-brown
then it was pulled out again flashed above the fence some feet further along and again split it halfway down with the first stroke and after waggling a little to extricate itself accompanied with curses in the darkness split it down to the ground with a second,chesterton-brown
the voice in the gloom swore again and then broke into a jolly laugh,chesterton-brown
he momentarily fulfilled all fanshaw s fable of an old piratical admiral though the details seemed afterwards to decompose into accidents,chesterton-brown
it seemed almost as if all the hair had come off his face from his thrusting it through a throng of elements,chesterton-brown
the admiral pooh poohed it at first as a piece of necessary but annoying garden work but at length the ring of real energy came back into his laughter and he cried with a mixture of impatience and good humour,chesterton-brown
i feel like that he said laughing but furiously flinging the sword some yards down the path and now let s go up to the house you must have some dinner,chesterton-brown
the entrance was flanked with two of those half featured lumps of stone with holes for eyes that are said to be south sea idols and on the brown oak beam across the doorway were some confused carvings that looked almost as barbaric,chesterton-brown
the first seemed to be the outline of some tower or other building crowned with what looked like curly pointed ribbons,chesterton-brown
pendragon shook his head with a kind of venerable amusement,chesterton-brown
and though the third thing isn t so very heraldic it would be more heraldic to suppose it a tower crowned with laurel than with fire and it looks just as like it,chesterton-brown
one story credits my unfortunate ancestor with having had the spaniard cut in two and that will fit the pretty picture also,chesterton-brown
it so happens replied his host coolly that there was no thunder and lightning at all in the two or three shipwrecks i know of in our family,chesterton-brown
someone saw a blaze hereabout don t you know as he walked home through a wood someone keeping sheep on the uplands inland thought he saw a flame hovering over pendragon tower,chesterton-brown
then pendragon broke into a scornful laugh again,chesterton-brown
it s very like fire,chesterton-brown
but such things were less prominent on the white panelling than some cases of quaint coloured south american birds very scientifically stuffed fantastic shells from the pacific and several instruments so rude and queer in shape that savages might have used them either to kill their enemies or to cook them,chesterton-brown
don t you really believe in the family story at all,chesterton-brown
please don t think me impertinent admiral pendragon,chesterton-brown
flambeau struck the table with his heavy fist,chesterton-brown
you won t understand i suppose unless i tell you the story,chesterton-brown
it was a silly notion i think and i quarrelled with my father pretty heartily for i was an ambitious man and was left to the last coming by succession after my own nephew,chesterton-brown
his body was never found,chesterton-brown
but he s practically sure to be here some time tonight and then it ll all end in smoke tobacco smoke,chesterton-brown
after a pause the priest spoke again in his mild manner,chesterton-brown
i tell you there is nothing in it he cried with ringing violence,chesterton-brown
this business is perfectly natural,chesterton-brown
please forgive me for everything said brown in his most sympathetic tone including spilling the wine,chesterton-brown
i think the lawn wants weeding said he dreamily,chesterton-brown
and now he added suddenly slinging the broom away let s go and water the flowers,chesterton-brown
father brown stood ruefully contemplating the decapitated plant,chesterton-brown
that s right and sir cecil could have that sword the admiral threw away by the fence here,chesterton-brown
i am fearfully clumsy replied the reverend gentleman weakly do you know i upset some wine at dinner,chesterton-brown
why i ve hit a man,chesterton-brown
but you can t mean,chesterton-brown
what is this,chesterton-brown
i suppose it can t spread to the house,chesterton-brown
behind him came the two negroes also with the old crooked cutlasses out of the trophy,chesterton-brown
he kept his finger along the nozzle of the pipe to ensure the aim and attended to no other business knowing only by the noise and that semi conscious corner of the eye the exciting incidents that began to tumble themselves about the island garden,chesterton-brown
ask her if they could get some buckets across and fill them from the river,chesterton-brown
flambeau s enormous strength more than redressed the odds in the fight especially as the fourth man still hovered near the house only a shadow and a voice,chesterton-brown
it was echoed by a howl not to be called human as the being broke from their hold and ran along the garden,chesterton-brown
he knew the use of a family legend,chesterton-brown
the fire hissed and shrieked more and more like a strangled thing as it grew narrower and narrower under the flood from the pipe and buckets but father brown still kept his eye on it as he went on speaking,chesterton-brown
don t let s talk about anything,chesterton-brown
he saw that the frustrated fire was extinguished and then refused to linger though he actually heard young pendragon escorted by an enthusiastic crowd come tramping up the river bank and might had he been moved by romantic curiosities have received the combined thanks of the man from the ship and the girl from the canoe,chesterton-brown
do you mean pendragon s chart of his pacific islands,chesterton-brown
put the same feather with an ink bottle a book and a stack of writing paper and most men will swear they ve seen a quill pen,chesterton-brown
i saw the rock you thought was like a dragon and the one like merlin and,chesterton-brown
but feeling horrible has nothing to do with not seeing things,chesterton-brown
ix,chesterton-brown
the line of the sea looked frozen in the very vividness of its violet blue like the vein of a frozen finger,chesterton-brown
half a mile farther on father brown was puzzled first by little labyrinths of flowerless flower pots covered with the low flat quiet coloured plants that look less like a garden than a tessellated pavement between weak curly paths studded with seats with curly backs,chesterton-brown
they try to revive these places in the winter but it never succeeds except with brighton and the old ones,chesterton-brown
but there was something fantastic about the snow combined with something artificial about the gold that haunted flambeau as well as his friend with some association he could not capture but which he knew was at once artistic and alien,chesterton-brown
yes said father brown,chesterton-brown
inland the little wintry gardens faded into a confused grey copse beyond that in the distance were long low barns of a lonely farmhouse and beyond that nothing but the long east anglian plains,chesterton-brown
for some reason or other the platform had given way under father brown and the unfortunate little man had dropped through to the level of the parade,chesterton-brown
though it seems odd it should bear me and you go through the weak place,chesterton-brown
the priest was holding a splinter of the broken wood between his finger and thumb and did not immediately reply,chesterton-brown
flambeau looked once more inland and out to sea and once more could see nothing but seas as wintry as the snow and snows as level as the sea,chesterton-brown
have you found the god of the temple,chesterton-brown
cried flambeau quite alarmed,chesterton-brown
following his finger flambeau saw for the first time the corners of a building nearer than the farmhouse but screened for the most part with a fringe of trees,chesterton-brown
in this however they were not altogether confirmed,chesterton-brown
but though he might have been a waxwork when they were within four yards of him he jumped up like a jack in the box when they came within three and said in a deferential though not undignified manner will you step inside gentlemen,chesterton-brown
my waiters are all italians you see and i thought it only fair they should see their countryman beat the black if he really can do it,chesterton-brown
he could only say amiably oh thank you very much,chesterton-brown
i have the keys he said,chesterton-brown
as instant evidence proved the proprietor had told then and after nothing but the literal truth,chesterton-brown
he will be starting presently,chesterton-brown
but he reflected that head cooks are proverbially arrogant and besides the host had come back with the sherry and that was the great thing,chesterton-brown
they are only interested in the sport and will stop in hotels for the night only,chesterton-brown
nor was there anything notable in the face except something that was probably a mere nervous trick a habit of opening one eye more narrowly than the other giving the impression that the other was larger or was perhaps artificial,chesterton-brown
curious said the dark haired man thoughtfully,chesterton-brown
but he was a very different figure from the confused mass of white and black that had appeared for an instant in the doorway,chesterton-brown
it is needless to say that he wore white spats and a white slip inside his waistcoat,chesterton-brown
but as i was saying he resumed as the negro still ostentatiously pulling on his yellow gloves betook himself briskly towards the watering place a queer music hall figure against that grey and frosty scene as i was saying i couldn t describe the man very minutely but he had a flourish and old fashioned whiskers and moustachios dark or dyed as in the pictures of foreign financiers round his neck was wrapped a long purple scarf that thrashed out in the wind as he walked,chesterton-brown
flambeau felt quite certain that one of his eyes was naturally larger than the other,chesterton-brown
father brown had his back to him and in that flash might have fallen dead on his face,chesterton-brown
it was the shock of that shadow before the shock of the iron crash that made the stranger quail and dodge and then dart into his inn leaving the flat and shining dagger he had dropped exactly where it had fallen,chesterton-brown
it startled him more than the small and distant detonation that had come just before,chesterton-brown
without ceremony he snatched up the little priest slung him astraddle on his shoulders and went racing towards seawood as fast as his long legs could carry him,chesterton-brown
and it was too dark to see him properly because it was under that bandstand affair,chesterton-brown
but i fear this business has deep roots and dark,chesterton-brown
of all god forsaken dustbins of nature i think the most heart breaking are places like that bandstand that were meant to be festive and are forlorn,chesterton-brown
and i felt that no one would ever be happy there again,chesterton-brown
as a fact i know from an irish policeman who is a friend of mine that he was found close up to the epsom grand stand in fact only hidden by one of the lower doors being pushed back,chesterton-brown
queried his companion,chesterton-brown
and short of that the more alone he is the more certain he is to be seen,chesterton-brown
i didn t know pugilism was your latest hobby,chesterton-brown
the attendant observed that his lordship was very busy as the fight was coming on soon but father brown had a good tempered tedium of reiteration for which the official mind is generally not prepared,chesterton-brown
only a word said father brown,chesterton-brown
you and your committees and parsons and petitions,chesterton-brown
said the nobleman with a touch of frosty humour,chesterton-brown
i could simply get him to escape,chesterton-brown
and what do you say to the two thousand people who have come to see it,chesterton-brown
far from it was the reply,chesterton-brown
my lord it is a matter of life and death said the priest,chesterton-brown
he said to the clerk who appeared almost instantly in the doorway i have a serious announcement to make to the audience shortly,chesterton-brown
whom did you consult,chesterton-brown
the only form in which voodoo began father brown reading aloud,chesterton-brown
the gongs beat with a deafening din as the doors of the shrine open and the monkey god is revealed almost the whole congregation rivet ecstatic eyes on him,chesterton-brown
what this,chesterton-brown
i will be with you to explain in a minute or two,chesterton-brown
demanded the dark champion pointing to the priest disdainfully,chesterton-brown
a beautiful italian head,chesterton-brown
he put the little leather book in his overcoat pocket,chesterton-brown
there was a silence and the little man went on,chesterton-brown
so flambeau said he replied with a sigh,chesterton-brown
have you never walked along a cliff and seen one man walking along the sands,chesterton-brown
for an intelligent murderer such as you or i might be it is an impossible plan to make sure that nobody is looking at you,chesterton-brown
anybody might have seen it done while the stand stood empty any tramp under the hedges or motorist among the hills,chesterton-brown
and here of course when the knock out blow came it would not be the only one,chesterton-brown
they are octoroons and african half bloods of various shades but i fear we english think all foreigners are much the same so long as they are dark and dirty,chesterton-brown
nigger ned had been overtaken a mile or two away and murdered three policemen with his closed left hand,chesterton-brown
for people had found out how fearful and vast and silent was the force of the savage secret society and by the time flambeau and father brown were leaning on the parade parapet in april the black man meant in england almost what he once meant in scotland,chesterton-brown
well but what would he do,chesterton-brown
the salad of colonel cray,chesterton-brown
but as he passed under the shadow of one handsome villa with verandas and wide ornate gardens he heard a noise that made him almost involuntarily stop,chesterton-brown
none of which seemed to make much sense,chesterton-brown
but he never consciously carried his actions outside the sphere of his own duty and in this case the two attitudes were aptly tested,chesterton-brown
half way down one side of the house stood out a projection like a very low shed it was as he afterwards discovered a large dustbin,chesterton-brown
he had a large palm leaf hat on the back of his head suggesting a halo that was by no means appropriate to the face but otherwise he was clad only in a very vivid suit of striped scarlet and yellow pyjamas which though glowing enough to behold must have been on a fresh morning pretty chilly to wear,chesterton-brown
he asked,chesterton-brown
all this father brown absorbed in detail more at leisure,chesterton-brown
if you were chased everywhere by devils and nearly,chesterton-brown
did you did you hit anything,chesterton-brown
he sneezed,chesterton-brown
it s lucky you didn t turn your artillery on him or you might have given him quite a bad cold,chesterton-brown
it was common enough at that time of the morning to find the remains of a banquet over night but to find it freshly spread so early was unusual,chesterton-brown
old cruet stand gone,chesterton-brown
the major patted him on the shoulder with a gesture almost peculiar to the soothing of a sick child and said it was a burglar,chesterton-brown
then as the restless man with the revolver turned again towards the door in the garden he added in a husky confidential voice i doubt whether i should send for the police for fear my friend here has been a little too free with his bullets and got on the wrong side of the law,chesterton-brown
i don t want any more shall we say sneezing,chesterton-brown
he remained thus for a measurable period as if engaged in some mysterious prayers,chesterton-brown
he was indeed emphatic but then he was talking to his cook the swarthy son of malta whose lean yellow and rather careworn face contrasted quaintly with his snow white cap and costume,chesterton-brown
the taller and more elegant man was still in his night garb with tousled black hair and now crawling about the garden on his hands and knees still looking for traces of the burglar and now and again to all appearance striking the ground with his hand in anger at not finding him,chesterton-brown
i m old fashioned myself and the things keep together,chesterton-brown
it isn t over till half past twelve and the colonel has to leave by then,chesterton-brown
i want to go to church she said with rather severe eyes,chesterton-brown
she was going there under the escort of a relative and old friend of hers dr oliver oman who though a scientific man of a somewhat bitter type was enthusiastic for music and would go even to church to get it,chesterton-brown
cried cray with wild eyes,chesterton-brown
snapped cray quite savagely,chesterton-brown
you want what no madman ever wants,chesterton-brown
he cried,chesterton-brown
old putnam and i were friends in the same mess but owing to some accidents on the afghan border i got my command much sooner than most men only we were both invalided home for a bit,chesterton-brown
i know what they think i am,chesterton-brown
it opened with difficulty and then only on darkness but as i turned back the door behind me sank back and settled into its place with a noise as of innumerable bolts,chesterton-brown
just in front of me was something that looked like a mountain,chesterton-brown
a door opened silently in the temple wall behind me and a man came out with a brown face and a black coat,chesterton-brown
if you had only seen the monkey s feet he said smiling steadily and without other preface we should have been very gentle you would only be tortured and die,chesterton-brown
it is vain to ask for mercy you must go free said the smiling man,chesterton-brown
well i ll simply tell you in the fewest words the three things that have happened since and you shall judge which of us is right,chesterton-brown
the second happened in a lodging in port said later on our journey home together,chesterton-brown
putnam poor fellow who had called the other thing a chance scratch was bound to take seriously the fact of finding me half insensible on the grass at dawn,chesterton-brown
there was a full moon as i walked to the window i could have seen a bird on the bare battlement or a sail on the horizon,chesterton-brown
father brown threw away a daisy chain he was making and rose with a wistful look,chesterton-brown
cray introduced him civilly enough as dr oman but he showed such disfavour in his very face that brown guessed the two men whether audrey knew it or not were rivals,chesterton-brown
i didn t know that was in your line he said rather rudely,chesterton-brown
i suppose said the priest who seemed anxious to change the subject all these spears and things are from india,chesterton-brown
at this moment the jolly subject of their conversation thrust his laughing lobsterish face into the room,chesterton-brown
the priest looked puzzled,chesterton-brown
by no social law rigid or implied could he be supposed to linger round the lunch of the anglo indian friends but he lingered covering his position with torrents of amusing but quite needless conversation,chesterton-brown
i can t eat it but i ll mix it like an angel,chesterton-brown
that s what i ve always been afraid would happen,chesterton-brown
a mustard plaster i suppose,chesterton-brown
you re an astounding card he said staring,chesterton-brown
and as for vinegar can any soldiers forget that solitary soldier who when the sun was darkened,chesterton-brown
pretty near said brown with the shadow of a smile for the emetic had very suddenly taken effect,chesterton-brown
i will go for the police,chesterton-brown
the temple of the monkey was either a coincidence or a part of the trick the trick was the trick of a white man,chesterton-brown
with that he went outside and spoke for a moment to the doctor,chesterton-brown
you did a fine thing,chesterton-brown
and remembered that there were emetics in the cruet stand said father brown,chesterton-brown
there was a silence,chesterton-brown
xi,chesterton-brown
those however who mock american journalism from the standpoint of somewhat mellower traditions forget a certain paradox which partly redeems it,chesterton-brown
but many american papers seized on the challenge as a great event and the sun threw the shadow of mr boulnois quite gigantically across its pages,chesterton-brown
in the bar parlour he rang the bell and had to wait some little time for a reply to it,chesterton-brown
it s a few yards down the road said the red haired man removing his cigar i shall be passing it myself in a minute but i m going on to pendragon park to try and see the fun,chesterton-brown
you re a journalist aren t you,chesterton-brown
are you interested in catastrophism,chesterton-brown
the american pressman considered him with more attention,chesterton-brown
sir claude champion was known to the readers of the western sun as well as mr boulnois,chesterton-brown
there was in him none of that antiquarian frivolity that we convey by the word dilettante,chesterton-brown
indeed boulnois s cottage stood just outside the gates of pendragon park,chesterton-brown
that very evening marked by mr kidd for the exposition of catastrophism had been marked by sir claude champion for an open air rendering of romeo and juliet in which he was to play romeo to a juliet it was needless to name,chesterton-brown
he is a man of grand intellectual powers said calhoun kidd in a deep voice,chesterton-brown
the last of the daylight had faded the skies were of a dark green grey like slate studded here and there with a star but lighter on the left side of the sky with the promise of a rising moon,chesterton-brown
mr boulnois asked me to offer his apologies sir he said but he has been obliged to go out suddenly,chesterton-brown
did he go with mrs with the rest of the party,chesterton-brown
he felt a strong desire to hustle them all along a bit and teach them business habits the hoary old dog and the grizzled heavy faced old butler with his prehistoric shirt front and the drowsy old moon and above all the scatter brained old philosopher who couldn t keep an appointment,chesterton-brown
the trees were as black and orderly as plumes upon a hearse there were still a few stars,chesterton-brown
at first he thought he must have fancied it or been mocked by a mere echo of his own tramp,chesterton-brown
more pines more pathway slid past him and then he stood rooted as by a blast of magic,chesterton-brown
over the black pine wood came flying and flashing in the moon a naked sword such a slender and sparkling rapier as may have fought many an unjust duel in that ancient park,chesterton-brown
he looked round wildly in the direction from which the dazzling missile had come and saw that at this point the sable facade of fir and pine was interrupted by a smaller road at right angles which when he turned it brought him in full view of the long lighted house with a lake and fountains in front of it,chesterton-brown
though he saw it there only for a moment though it was outlandish and incredible in costume being clad from neck to heel in tight crimson with glints of gold yet he knew in one flash of moonlight who it was,chesterton-brown
he had been run through the body,chesterton-brown
the moonlight discoloured everything against dalroy s red hair his wan face looked not so much white as pale green,chesterton-brown
boulnois with my own sword he threw it,chesterton-brown
and a priest too i suppose said dalroy in an undecipherable manner,chesterton-brown
in one sense drawled the representative of the sun,chesterton-brown
boulnois said calhoun kidd and whistled softly,chesterton-brown
but john boulnois changed his mind john boulnois left his home abruptly and all alone and came over to this darned park an hour or so ago,chesterton-brown
asked james dalroy and again kidd was conscious of an irrational desire to hit him on his curling mouth,chesterton-brown
then without glancing at the point or pommel he handed the long weapon to the doctor,chesterton-brown
but the little priest only walked slower and slower in the dim cloister of pine and at last stopped dead on the steps of the house,chesterton-brown
she said,chesterton-brown
she asked steadily,chesterton-brown
shall i tell you something more,chesterton-brown
will you tell me why you haven t jumped to the conclusion of poor john s guilt as all the rest have done,chesterton-brown
but such as they are they don t fit in with mr boulnois being the murderer,chesterton-brown
i know your husband only slightly but i think this crime of his as generally conceived something very like a moral impossibility,chesterton-brown
he would not snatch romeo s sword from its romantic scabbard or slay his foe on the sundial as on a kind of altar or leave his body among the roses or fling the sword away among the pines,chesterton-brown
she said and looked at him with eyes like diamonds,chesterton-brown
whose prints they were i have no earthly clue but why should anybody hold a sword half way down,chesterton-brown
there is only one enemy said father brown whom it is easier to kill with a dagger than a sword,chesterton-brown
yes she said with a face like marble,chesterton-brown
he hated my husband,chesterton-brown
said brown patiently,chesterton-brown
sir claude champion was not a great man he was a celebrated and successful man,chesterton-brown
he still liked champion exactly as he liked him at school he admired him as he would admire a conjuring trick done at the dinner table,chesterton-brown
oh don t you see,chesterton-brown
champion would burst in on john s shabbiest hours or homeliest meals with some dazzling present or announcement or expedition that made it like the visit of haroun alraschid and john would accept or refuse amiably with one eye off so to speak like one lazy schoolboy agreeing or disagreeing with another,chesterton-brown
when champion who was interviewed nearly every day heard of this late little crumb of success falling to his unconscious rival the last link snapped that held back his devilish hatred,chesterton-brown
nobody could do it now,chesterton-brown
he stabbed himself crying out like a devil that boulnois was slaying him he lies there in the garden dead of his own jealousy to produce jealousy and john is sitting in the dining room reading a book,chesterton-brown
why what can you mean,chesterton-brown
what what,chesterton-brown
rejoined the cleric energetically and set off scuttling up the path towards the park gates,chesterton-brown
when father brown reached the house with the beehive and the drowsy dog a small and neat maid servant showed him into the dining room where boulnois sat reading by a shaded lamp exactly as his wife described him,chesterton-brown
i shan t interrupt you a moment,chesterton-brown
john boulnois was a big slow moving man with a massive head partly grey and partly bald and blunt burly features,chesterton-brown
i know it was a strange crime assented brown in a low voice,chesterton-brown
i know assented the other but one often has to choose between feeling a damned fool and being one,chesterton-brown
i opened the front door and there was a little man with his mouth open to speak and his notebook open to write in,chesterton-brown
i didn t commit murder continued the catastrophist mildly but only perjury,chesterton-brown
and what asked boulnois smiling is the little penance i have so luckily been let off,chesterton-brown
it had come under the prussian hegemony quite late in history hardly fifty years before the fine summer day when flambeau and father brown found themselves sitting in its gardens and drinking its beer,chesterton-brown
the sky was as prussian a blue as potsdam itself could require but it was yet more like that lavish and glowing use of the colour which a child extracts from a shilling paint box,chesterton-brown
nay in his sleepy irresponsibility he even found himself eyeing the knobbed and clumsy head of his own shabby umbrella with some faint memories of the ogre s club in a coloured toy book,chesterton-brown
in this place they not only fight with swords but kill without swords,chesterton-brown
do you mean a bow and arrow,chesterton-brown
you remember of course that this place was forcibly annexed at the time of bismarck s very earliest schemes of consolidation forcibly that is but not at all easily,chesterton-brown
wolves with the hair of the ermine crows that are crowned and kings these things be many as vermin yet three shall abide these things,chesterton-brown
i know said father brown,chesterton-brown
anyhow that s the story of the arnholds and he was the last survivor of them,chesterton-brown
he multiplied the ordinary daily and nightly guard round his castle till there seemed to be more sentry boxes than houses in the town and doubtful characters were shot without mercy,chesterton-brown
it was carried out with extraordinary thoroughness and severity by very well organized officials over a small and familiar area and so far as human strength and science can be absolutely certain of anything prince otto was absolutely certain that nobody could introduce so much as a toy pistol into heiligwaldenstein,chesterton-brown
perhaps somebody introduced a firearm so new that it didn t even look like a firearm,chesterton-brown
he was in charge here of the inquiry about prince otto but i forgot to ask him anything about the bullet,chesterton-brown
hitherto it had never been found by the most exacting inquiry which could,chesterton-brown
it is only right to say that it received some support from fragmentary words spoken by the great ludwig in the hour of death when he looked at heinrich but pointed at paul and said you have not told him and was soon afterwards incapable of speech,chesterton-brown
when it did open it was empty too,chesterton-brown
next came words of a terrible clearness coming nearer and next one man rushing into the room and telling the news as briefly as such news is told,chesterton-brown
but dead or alive he was a riddle he who had always hidden in the inmost chamber out there in the wet woods unarmed and alone,chesterton-brown
asked the priest staring rather vacantly at the veil of the branches above him,chesterton-brown
the foreign visitors especially the mining experts were in the wildest doubt and excitement as well as many important prussian officials and it soon began to be clear that the scheme for finding the treasure bulked much bigger in the business than people had supposed,chesterton-brown
what an odd person you are,chesterton-brown
if she just pulled their heads off as a child does it looks as if and he hesitated,chesterton-brown
but that and every other suspicion breaks down on the one point the want of a weapon,chesterton-brown
all the same however romantic you are you can t imagine a big bullet into a man s jaw or brain without using a gun or pistol,chesterton-brown
there was only one in his head said his companion but there was another bullet hole in the sash,chesterton-brown
i don t think i remember he said,chesterton-brown
don t think me rude,chesterton-brown
the oldest tower of the castle the dragon tower stood up as grotesque as the ale mug but as homely,chesterton-brown
no doubt you ve heard of his career which was rather romantic,chesterton-brown
well well what a queer story,chesterton-brown
in what way did they kill the man,chesterton-brown
as i explained before he might easily have been strangled,chesterton-brown
you mean he committed suicide,chesterton-brown
i am only on my holiday he said,chesterton-brown
one of the innumerable sentries saluted him but he did not notice it,chesterton-brown
all the full dressed diplomatists he left behind were unimportant,chesterton-brown
for this he had somewhat reluctantly paid and promised money on the chance of gaining the larger amount and for this he had stolen out of his palace like a thief in the rain for he had thought of another way to get the desire of his eyes and to get it cheap,chesterton-brown
some concession to his cause some appeal to his principles would probably get the mere money secret out of him,chesterton-brown
for as far as the eye could see there ran the rifles of his friends and not one pinch of powder for his enemies,chesterton-brown
he found himself on a small platform of rock broken abruptly by the three corners of precipice,chesterton-brown
moonrise had already made a deathly dawn behind the crests and crags and the rain had ceased,chesterton-brown
and in their chariots went on the old man weakly but we will trust in the name of the lord of hosts his last words were inaudible but he closed the book reverently and being nearly blind made a groping movement and gripped the reading stand,chesterton-brown
i fear we have not met he said since that awful cannonade in which your poor brother died,chesterton-brown
whatever is to be said of the policy of your family no one for one moment imagines that you were moved by the mere gold you have proved yourself above the suspicion that,chesterton-brown
let him cease to speak,chesterton-brown
it was fully forty seconds before he even realized that the two hungarian servants had done it and that they had done it with his own military scarf,chesterton-brown
his legs were free to leap like an antelope on the mountains his arms were free to use any gesture or wave any signal but he could not speak,chesterton-brown
far as the eye could see ran the rifles of his friends every one of whom would shoot him dead if he could not answer the challenge,chesterton-brown
the moon had risen in strengthening silver and the sky showed in stripes of bright nocturnal blue between the black stripes of the pines about the castle,chesterton-brown
he stooped to pick a flower as if it were a charm against enchantment,chesterton-brown
the second challenge came and then a shot that shrieked as it came and then was stilled suddenly by impact,chesterton-brown
the bullet had gone through the gag into the jaw that is why there was a shot hole in the scarf but only one shot,chesterton-brown
but we can know i fancy that this hedwig was a heroine and deserved to marry a man who became something of a hero,chesterton-brown
where are you going,chesterton-brown
the man who was thursday by g k chesterton 1908,chesterton-thursday
life was a fly that faded and death a drone that stung the world was very old indeed when you and i were young,chesterton-thursday
i find again the book we found i feel the hour that flings far out of fish shaped paumanok some cry of cleaner things and the green carnation withered as in forest fires that pass roared in the wind of all the world ten million leaves of grass or sane and sweet and sudden as a bird sings in the rain truth out of tusitala spoke and pleasure out of pain,chesterton-thursday
the doubts that were so plain to chase so dreadful to withstand oh who shall understand but you yea who shall understand,chesterton-thursday
chapter i,chesterton-thursday
it was described with some justice as an artistic colony though it never in any definable way produced any art,chesterton-thursday
even if the people were not artists the whole was nevertheless artistic,chesterton-thursday
thus and thus only the whole place had properly to be regarded it had to be considered not so much as a workshop for artists but as a frail but finished work of art,chesterton-thursday
it was not by any means the only evening of which he was the hero,chesterton-thursday
and mr lucian gregory the red haired poet was really in some sense a man worth listening to even if one only laughed at the end of it,chesterton-thursday
this combination at once tickled and terrified the nerves of a neurotic population,chesterton-thursday
across the great part of the dome they were grey with the strangest tints of violet and mauve and an unnatural pink or pale green but towards the west the whole grew past description transparent and passionate and the last red hot plumes of it covered up the sun like something too good to be seen,chesterton-thursday
i say that there are some inhabitants who may remember the evening if only by that oppressive sky,chesterton-thursday
he signalised his entrance by differing with the established poet gregory upon the whole nature of poetry,chesterton-thursday
you say you are a poet of law i say you are a contradiction in terms,chesterton-thursday
an artist is identical with an anarchist he cried,chesterton-thursday
an artist disregards all governments abolishes all conventions,chesterton-thursday
said gregory who was very rational when anyone else attempted paradox,chesterton-thursday
it is because after they have passed sloane square they know that the next station must be victoria and nothing but victoria,chesterton-thursday
the rare strange thing is to hit the mark the gross obvious thing is to miss it,chesterton-thursday
it is victoria,chesterton-thursday
inquired gregory sarcastically,chesterton-thursday
it is to me the cry of a herald announcing conquest,chesterton-thursday
we know that the new jerusalem will only be like victoria,chesterton-thursday
being sick is a revolt,chesterton-thursday
it is things going right he cried that is poetical i our digestions for instance going sacredly and silently right that is the foundation of all poetry,chesterton-thursday
you don t expect me he said to revolutionise society on this lawn,chesterton-thursday
i beg your pardon,chesterton-thursday
said syme and strolled away,chesterton-thursday
do you,chesterton-thursday
when you say thank you for the salt do you mean what you say,chesterton-thursday
now sometimes a man like your brother really finds a thing he does mean,chesterton-thursday
only in that sense i speak of replied syme or if you prefer it in that nonsense,chesterton-thursday
he said that has to be done anonymously,chesterton-thursday
he defended respectability with violence and exaggeration,chesterton-thursday
to his astonishment he discovered the whole garden empty,chesterton-thursday
for what followed was so improbable that it might well have been a dream,chesterton-thursday
the tall hat and long frock coat were black the face in an abrupt shadow was almost as dark,chesterton-thursday
might i have a moment s conversation,chesterton-thursday
about this and this he cried about order and anarchy,chesterton-thursday
no cried out gregory in a voice that rang down the street i did not stand here to resume our argument but to end it for ever,chesterton-thursday
indeed,chesterton-thursday
i am afraid my fury and your insult are too shocking to be wiped out even with an apology said gregory very calmly,chesterton-thursday
in what i said,chesterton-thursday
and in no other sense he asked you think me serious,chesterton-thursday
he cried,chesterton-thursday
one comes here and talks a pack of bosh and perhaps some sense as well but i should think very little of a man who didn t keep something in the background of his life that was more serious than all this talking something more serious whether it was religion or only drink,chesterton-thursday
oh said syme with a beaming smile we are all catholics now,chesterton-thursday
inquired syme as the other paused,chesterton-thursday
i disagree but i hope at least that he is always a sportsman,chesterton-thursday
the two got into it in silence,chesterton-thursday
the cab pulled up before a particularly dreary and greasy beershop into which gregory rapidly conducted his companion,chesterton-thursday
the pate de foie gras is not good here but i can recommend the game,chesterton-thursday
and went away apparently to get it,chesterton-thursday
do let me start you with a half bottle of pommery at least,chesterton-thursday
syme tasted it and found it particularly good,chesterton-thursday
it is new to me for a nightmare to lead to a lobster,chesterton-thursday
i admit that there may be a slight disproportion let us say between the inner arrangements of this excellent hotel and its simple and unpretentious exterior,chesterton-thursday
it is quite simple replied gregory,chesterton-thursday
yes we are serious about everything answered gregory,chesterton-thursday
may i smoke,chesterton-thursday
it is not a little to his credit that he performed these rites with so much composure for almost before he had begun them the table at which he sat had begun to revolve first slowly and then rapidly as if at an insane seance,chesterton-thursday
they went rattling down a kind of roaring chimney as rapidly as a lift cut loose and they came with an abrupt bump to the bottom,chesterton-thursday
a heavy voice with a foreign accent asked him who he was,chesterton-thursday
i must ask you to forgive me all these formalities said gregory we have to be very strict here,chesterton-thursday
there were no rifles or pistols in this apartment but round the walls of it were hung more dubious and dreadful shapes things that looked like the bulbs of iron plants or the eggs of iron birds,chesterton-thursday
it was one of those quite arbitrary emotions like jumping off a cliff or falling in love,chesterton-thursday
does this place strike you as being serious,chesterton-thursday
what is it you object to,chesterton-thursday
we dig deeper and we blow you higher,chesterton-thursday
and right and left said syme with a simple eagerness i hope you will abolish them too,chesterton-thursday
i have an aunt who lived over a shop but this is the first time i have found people living from preference under a public house,chesterton-thursday
gregory smiled,chesterton-thursday
syme smoked thoughtfully and looked at him with interest,chesterton-thursday
i read up all about bishops in our anarchist pamphlets in superstition the vampire and priests of prey,chesterton-thursday
presumptuous human reason,chesterton-thursday
now i am a humanitarian myself but i have i hope enough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who like nietzsche admire violence the proud mad war of nature and all that you know,chesterton-thursday
i often said let the weak perish it is the law,chesterton-thursday
asked syme,chesterton-thursday
but you cannot be for five minutes in the room with him without feeling that caesar and napoleon would have been children in his hands,chesterton-thursday
he looked at me with his large but indecipherable face,chesterton-thursday
why then dress up as an anarchist you fool,chesterton-thursday
i preached blood and murder to those women day and night and by god they would let me wheel their perambulators,chesterton-thursday
what do you call this tremendous president of yours,chesterton-thursday
the gentleman who has for some time past played with propriety and general applause the difficult part of thursday has died quite suddenly,chesterton-thursday
in fact i will confide to you something that i would not say in so many words to the anarchists who will be coming to the room in about ten minutes,chesterton-thursday
said syme heartily i congratulate you,chesterton-thursday
over the chair beside the table was thrown a heavy looking cape or cloak,chesterton-thursday
why do i positively like you gregory,chesterton-thursday
gregory i gave you a promise before i came into this place,chesterton-thursday
yes said syme very seriously a promise,chesterton-thursday
have you got a secret,chesterton-thursday
yes i will swear not to tell the anarchists anything you tell me,chesterton-thursday
we have known the dodge for some time at scotland yard,chesterton-thursday
but i think i hear your friends coming,chesterton-thursday
before one of the fresh faces could appear at the doorway gregory s stunned surprise had fallen from him,chesterton-thursday
don t you see it s not necessary,chesterton-thursday
cried syme,chesterton-thursday
i m a policeman deprived of the help of the police,chesterton-thursday
come come,chesterton-thursday
i shall not break my word said syme sternly nor will you break yours,chesterton-thursday
i am glad to see that your gate is well enough guarded to make it hard for anyone to be here who was not a delegate,chesterton-thursday
what do you mean,chesterton-thursday
well comrade said the man with the papers after a pause i suppose we d better give you a seat in the meeting,chesterton-thursday
little was to be hoped from them,chesterton-thursday
i think it is time we began he said the steam tug is waiting on the river already,chesterton-thursday
we have elected many and splendid thursdays,chesterton-thursday
cruelty or anything approaching to cruelty revolted him always,chesterton-thursday
if no comrade suggests a name i can only tell myself that that dear dynamiter who is gone from us has carried into the unknowable abysses the last secret of his virtue and his innocence,chesterton-thursday
asked the chairman,chesterton-thursday
but he was smiling and altogether at ease,chesterton-thursday
syme had once thought that anarchists under all their bravado were only playing the fool,chesterton-thursday
they learn about anarchists from sixpenny novels they learn about anarchists from tradesmen s newspapers they learn about anarchists from ally sloper s half holiday and the sporting times,chesterton-thursday
for it is deep deep under the earth that the persecuted are permitted to assemble as the christians assembled in the catacombs,chesterton-thursday
suppose we seem as mad as the christians because we are really as meek,chesterton-thursday
ah how little he knows himself,chesterton-thursday
we are modest as they were modest look at me,chesterton-thursday
yet this did not prevent their being accused of eating human flesh,chesterton-thursday
comrade witherspoon said gregory with a feverish gaiety is anxious to know why nobody eats him laughter,chesterton-thursday
superbly careless of the slanders that represent us as assassins and enemies of human society we shall pursue with moral courage and quiet intellectual pressure the permanent ideals of brotherhood and simplicity,chesterton-thursday
by the sheer rush of routine however the motion would have been put and carried,chesterton-thursday
having said these first formal words in a moderated tone and with a brief simplicity he made his next word ring and volley in the vault as if one of the guns had gone off,chesterton-thursday
do we line these walls with weapons and bar that door with death lest anyone should come and hear comrade gregory saying to us be good and you will be happy honesty is the best policy and virtue is its own reward,chesterton-thursday
but i say that we are the enemies of society and so much the worse for society,chesterton-thursday
ever since syme had risen gregory had sat staring at him his face idiotic with astonishment,chesterton-thursday
he knows as well as i do that i am keeping all my engagements and doing nothing but my duty,chesterton-thursday
we do not want the supreme council of anarchy infected with a maudlin mercy hear hear,chesterton-thursday
i set myself against comrade gregory as impersonally and as calmly as i should choose one pistol rather than another out of that rack upon the wall and i say that rather than have gregory and his milk and water methods on the supreme council i would offer myself for election,chesterton-thursday
he cried at the top of a voice that tore his throat,chesterton-thursday
i am come to destroy you and to fulfil your prophecies,chesterton-thursday
stop it it is all,chesterton-thursday
gregory had been screaming for some time past now there was a change in his accent more shocking than any scream,chesterton-thursday
yes said syme quite motionless what is he,chesterton-thursday
the amendment will as usual be put first said mr buttons the chairman with mechanical rapidity,chesterton-thursday
said mr witherspoon,chesterton-thursday
strike but hear me,chesterton-thursday
he merely began,chesterton-thursday
comrades cried gregory in a voice like that of a martyr who in an ecstacy of pain has passed beyond pain it is nothing to me whether you detest me as a tyrant or detest me as a slave,chesterton-thursday
do not elect this man,chesterton-thursday
the roar rose like the sea the hands rose like a forest and three minutes afterwards mr gabriel syme of the secret police service was elected to the post of thursday on the general council of the anarchists of europe,chesterton-thursday
you are a devil,chesterton-thursday
into what sort of devils parliament have you entrapped me if it comes to that,chesterton-thursday
the boat is quite ready said mr buttons bustling up,chesterton-thursday
almost in the act of stepping on board gabriel syme turned to the gaping gregory,chesterton-thursday
what do you mean,chesterton-thursday
the tale of a detective,chesterton-thursday
his respectability was spontaneous and sudden a rebellion against rebellion,chesterton-thursday
the more his mother preached a more than puritan abstinence the more did his father expand into a more than pagan latitude and by the time the former had come to enforcing vegetarianism the latter had pretty well reached the point of defending cannibalism,chesterton-thursday
he had been blind and deaf for a moment and then seen the smoke clearing the broken windows and the bleeding faces,chesterton-thursday
but he seemed to be getting no nearer his enemy and what was worse no nearer a living,chesterton-thursday
the red river reflected the red sky and they both reflected his anger,chesterton-thursday
also his yellow beard and hair were more unkempt and leonine than when they appeared long afterwards cut and pointed on the lawns of saffron park,chesterton-thursday
he said sharply,chesterton-thursday
if we are calm replied the policeman it is the calm of organised resistance,chesterton-thursday
good god the board schools,chesterton-thursday
what education i had was very rough and old fashioned i am afraid,chesterton-thursday
but good lord man he said you oughtn t to be a policeman,chesterton-thursday
for much the same reason that you abused the police replied the other,chesterton-thursday
how comes a man like you to be talking philosophy in a blue helmet on the thames embankment,chesterton-thursday
i think you might almost join us,chesterton-thursday
he is certain that the scientific and artistic worlds are silently bound in a crusade against the family and the state,chesterton-thursday
syme s eyes were bright with a sympathetic curiosity,chesterton-thursday
the ordinary detective discovers from a ledger or a diary that a crime has been committed,chesterton-thursday
you are not sufficiently democratic answered the policeman but you were right when you said just now that our ordinary treatment of the poor criminal was a pretty brutal business,chesterton-thursday
we remember the great poisoning princes of the renaissance,chesterton-thursday
thieves respect property,chesterton-thursday
murderers respect human life they merely wish to attain a greater fulness of human life in themselves by the sacrifice of what seems to them to be lesser lives,chesterton-thursday
the common criminal is a bad man but at least he is as it were a conditional good man,chesterton-thursday
yes the modern world has retained all those parts of police work which are really oppressive and ignominious the harrying of the poor the spying upon the unfortunate,chesterton-thursday
cried the policeman clasping his hands with an excitement uncommon in persons of his figure and costume but it is intolerable,chesterton-thursday
a moment more and you may lose the glory of working with us perhaps the glory of dying with the last heroes of the world,chesterton-thursday
what is this anarchy,chesterton-thursday
the outer ring the main mass of their supporters are merely anarchists that is men who believe that rules and formulas have destroyed human happiness,chesterton-thursday
they believe that if a man picked a pocket he would naturally feel exquisitely good,chesterton-thursday
and so also the men of the inner circle speak the sacred priesthood,chesterton-thursday
when they say that mankind shall be free at last they mean that mankind shall commit suicide,chesterton-thursday
how can i join you,chesterton-thursday
telephone,chesterton-thursday
somewhat dazed and considerably excited syme allowed himself to be led to a side door in the long row of buildings of scotland yard,chesterton-thursday
and in some strange way though there was not the shadow of a shape in the gloom syme knew two things first that it came from a man of massive stature and second that the man had his back to him,chesterton-thursday
syme quite swept off his feet made a feeble fight against this irrevocable phrase,chesterton-thursday
well really said syme i don t know any profession of which mere willingness is the final test,chesterton-thursday
acting under the advice of his friend the policeman who was professionally inclined to neatness he trimmed his hair and beard bought a good hat clad himself in an exquisite summer suit of light blue grey with a pale yellow flower in the button hole and in short became that elegant and rather insupportable person whom gregory had first encountered in the little garden of saffron park,chesterton-thursday
when syme stepped out on to the steam tug he had a singular sensation of stepping out into something entirely new not merely into the landscape of a new land but even into the landscape of a new planet,chesterton-thursday
over the whole landscape lay a luminous and unnatural discoloration as of that disastrous twilight which milton spoke of as shed by the sun in eclipse so that syme fell easily into his first thought that he was actually on some other and emptier planet which circled round some sadder star,chesterton-thursday
for even the most dehumanised modern fantasies depend on some older and simpler figure the adventures may be mad but the adventurer must be sane,chesterton-thursday
the tug was worked by two men and with much toil went comparatively slowly,chesterton-thursday
they made him feel that he was landing on the colossal steps of some egyptian palace and indeed the thing suited his mood for he was in his own mind mounting to attack the solid thrones of horrible and heathen kings,chesterton-thursday
the feast of fear,chesterton-thursday
syme drew closer and closer noting all this and still the figure did not stir,chesterton-thursday
he was as motionless as a wax work and got on the nerves somewhat in the same way,chesterton-thursday
many people have this nervous trick of a crooked smile and in many it is even attractive,chesterton-thursday
he spoke without further explanation or inquiry like a man speaking to an old colleague,chesterton-thursday
nor have i answered the man in an ordinary tone,chesterton-thursday
of course the secretary of the branch told you everything that can be told,chesterton-thursday
he said that if you didn t seem to be hiding nobody hunted you out,chesterton-thursday
asked syme,chesterton-thursday
god blast your impudence,chesterton-thursday
it will never be known i suppose why this square itself should look so alien and in some ways so continental,chesterton-thursday
as a fact he had bought bad cigars round leicester square ever since he was a boy,chesterton-thursday
some of their jokes could almost be heard across the square,chesterton-thursday
when syme had seen him his first thought was that the weight of him must break down the balcony of stone,chesterton-thursday
he was enlarged terribly to scale and this sense of size was so staggering that when syme saw him all the other figures seemed quite suddenly to dwindle and become dwarfish,chesterton-thursday
they do say they will throw bombs at ze king,chesterton-thursday
syme indeed was one of those men who are open to all the more nameless psychological influences in a degree a little dangerous to mental health,chesterton-thursday
as he walked across the inner room towards the balcony the large face of sunday grew larger and larger and syme was gripped with a fear that when he was quite close the face would be too big to be possible and that he would scream aloud,chesterton-thursday
his face was very large but it was still possible to humanity,chesterton-thursday
but the eyes did look out of the tangle and they were the sad eyes of some russian serf,chesterton-thursday
and indeed when syme came in the president with that daring disregard of public suspicion which was his policy was actually chaffing gogol upon his inability to assume conventional graces,chesterton-thursday
but if a gentleman puts on a top hat and a frock coat and then goes about on his hands and knees well he may attract attention,chesterton-thursday
you hide as much as anybody but you can t do it you see you re such an ass,chesterton-thursday
i am not good at deception said tuesday gloomily flushing,chesterton-thursday
but as he looked at the others he began to see in each of them exactly what he had seen in the man by the river a demoniac detail somewhere,chesterton-thursday
syme s original cicerone bore the title of monday he was the secretary of the council and his twisted smile was regarded with more terror than anything except the president s horrible happy laughter,chesterton-thursday
he was typical of each of the tribe each man was subtly and differently wrong,chesterton-thursday
but syme sensitive to such things felt somehow that the man carried a rich atmosphere with him a rich atmosphere that suffocated,chesterton-thursday
and in the gloom and thickness of the beard his dark red mouth showed sensual and scornful,chesterton-thursday
his face was as grey as his long grey beard his forehead was lifted and fixed finally in a furrow of mild despair,chesterton-thursday
another hateful fancy crossed syme s quivering mind,chesterton-thursday
he carried his fine clothes with confidence rather than ease and he mostly wore a set smile,chesterton-thursday
but on the younger and grosser man they seemed only an enigma,chesterton-thursday
chapter vi,chesterton-thursday
the sense of an unnatural symbolism always settled back on him again,chesterton-thursday
the ends of the earth were closing in,chesterton-thursday
even the instrument was chosen the black bearded marquis it appeared was to carry the bomb,chesterton-thursday
most of the talkers took little heed of him debating now with their faces closer together and almost uniformly grave save when for an instant the smile of the secretary ran aslant across his face as the jagged lightning runs aslant across the sky,chesterton-thursday
syme felt moved to spring up and leap over the balcony,chesterton-thursday
in the presence of these powerful and repulsive men who were the princes of anarchy he had almost forgotten the frail and fanciful figure of the poet gregory the mere aesthete of anarchism,chesterton-thursday
he took his cold hand off the cold stone balustrade,chesterton-thursday
whenever he looked back at the breakfast table he saw the president still quietly studying him with big unbearable eyes,chesterton-thursday
either by anonymous poison or sudden street accident by hypnotism or by fire from hell sunday could certainly strike him,chesterton-thursday
it never occurred to him to be spiritually won over to the enemy,chesterton-thursday
but this was a kind of modern meanness to which syme could not sink even in his extreme morbidity,chesterton-thursday
the old professor had such slops as suggested a sickening second childhood,chesterton-thursday
most of the best things have been brought off with a knife,chesterton-thursday
it is as perfect a symbol of us as is incense of the prayers of the christians,chesterton-thursday
it must expand,chesterton-thursday
no if the only end of the thing is nothing said dr bull with his sphinx like smile it hardly seems worth doing,chesterton-thursday
the only question is how wednesday is to strike the blow,chesterton-thursday
before we discuss that he said in a small quiet voice let us go into a private room,chesterton-thursday
a barrel organ in the street suddenly sprang with a jerk into a jovial tune,chesterton-thursday
but he did feel himself as the ambassador of all these common and kindly people in the street who every day marched into battle to the music of the barrel organ,chesterton-thursday
all was swallowed up in an ultimate certainty that the president was wrong and that the barrel organ was right,chesterton-thursday
if the people of the barrel organ could keep their old world obligations so could he,chesterton-thursday
syme went last outwardly calm but with all his brain and body throbbing with romantic rhythm,chesterton-thursday
zso,chesterton-thursday
ven you vant talk importance you run yourselves in a dark box,chesterton-thursday
you don t seem to know anything about mankind,chesterton-thursday
you die for mankind first and then you get up and smite their oppressors,chesterton-thursday
gogol sat down last grumbling in his brown beard about gombromise,chesterton-thursday
comrades we were discussing plans and naming places,chesterton-thursday
sunday struck the table,chesterton-thursday
he sat stiff in his with his hand in his pocket and on the handle of his loaded revolver,chesterton-thursday
strangers overhearing us matters nothing,chesterton-thursday
he cried leaping,chesterton-thursday
i will waste no more words,chesterton-thursday
gogol sprang to his feet a pistol in each hand,chesterton-thursday
the unaccountable conduct of professor de worms,chesterton-thursday
the alleged pole was a little pale under his tangle of dark hair but he put two fingers into the pocket with apparent coolness and pulled out a blue strip of card,chesterton-thursday
said the late gogol,chesterton-thursday
i see it s a fair cop,chesterton-thursday
not a bit answered gogol and with one finger he ripped off the whole of his shaggy head covering emerging with thin red hair and a pale pert face,chesterton-thursday
the consequence is that it would annoy me for just about two and a half minutes if i heard that you had died in torments,chesterton-thursday
the red haired detective who had masqueraded as gogol rose to his feet without a word and walked out of the room with an air of perfect nonchalance,chesterton-thursday
would it not be better he said a little sharply to discuss further the details of our project now that the spy has left us,chesterton-thursday
breakfast here next sunday,chesterton-thursday
of course i fully appreciate your forethought when in the actual presence of a traitor,chesterton-thursday
i really fail to understand he began in high offense,chesterton-thursday
how do you know you aren t overheard now,chesterton-thursday
they meant that while sunday could not denounce him like gogol he still could not trust him like the others,chesterton-thursday
at last he rose and made his way out of the hotel into leicester square,chesterton-thursday
he was considerably astonished to see standing quite still outside the shop and staring into the window a man,chesterton-thursday
he could only suppose that the man s malady whatever it was involved some momentary fits of rigidity or trance,chesterton-thursday
he strolled away through the dancing snow turned up two or three streets down through two or three others and entered a small soho restaurant for lunch,chesterton-thursday
but even the shudder had the delightful shame of escape,chesterton-thursday
at a small table close up to the blank window and the white street of snow sat the old anarchist professor over a glass of milk with his lifted livid face and pendent eyelids,chesterton-thursday
i stopped too long up in that room so that even such leaden feet could catch me up,chesterton-thursday
he set off at a smart pace twisting and whirling his stick in the direction of covent garden,chesterton-thursday
scarcely had he done so when professor de worms hobbled heavily into the shop sat down with difficulty and ordered a glass of milk,chesterton-thursday
but the old man could only walk like a snail and syme had walked like the wind,chesterton-thursday
turning sharply he saw rising gradually higher and higher up the omnibus steps a top hat soiled and dripping with snow and under the shadow of its brim the short sighted face and shaky shoulders of professor de worms,chesterton-thursday
syme sprang erect upon the rocking car and after staring wildly at the wintry sky that grew gloomier every moment he ran down the steps,chesterton-thursday
there was none there could not in any case have been much for the little streets were thick with the soundless snow,chesterton-thursday
on each side of syme the walls of the alley were blind and featureless there was no little window or any kind of eve,chesterton-thursday
at first he was startled to find these great roads so empty as if a pestilence had swept through the city,chesterton-thursday
but right up against these dreary colours rose the black bulk of the cathedral and upon the top of the cathedral was a random splash and great stain of snow still clinging as to an alpine peak,chesterton-thursday
the devils might have captured heaven but they had not yet captured the cross,chesterton-thursday
syme waited for him as st george waited for the dragon as a man waits for a final explanation or for death,chesterton-thursday
he made a wild gesture as if to knock the old man s hat off called out something like catch me if you can and went racing away across the white open circus,chesterton-thursday
he saw the yellow panes of a low lighted public house flung himself into it and ordered beer,chesterton-thursday
when gabriel syme found himself finally established in a chair and opposite to him fixed and final also the lifted eyebrows and leaden eyelids of the professor his fears fully returned,chesterton-thursday
one possibility however kept him hopeful and yet helpless,chesterton-thursday
perhaps the new thursday was always chased along cheapside as the new lord mayor is always escorted along it,chesterton-thursday
even his great presence of mind could only manage a reply with an air of rather blundering jocularity,chesterton-thursday
i thought you looked like a policeman,chesterton-thursday
have my boots got that watchful look,chesterton-thursday
perhaps policeman is a relative term,chesterton-thursday
i don t mind being anything in german thought,chesterton-thursday
your suggestion is ridiculous he began,chesterton-thursday
are you or are you not a police detective,chesterton-thursday
you swear it,chesterton-thursday
you are an anarchist you are a dynamiter,chesterton-thursday
professor de worms fell back in his chair with a curious air of kindly collapse,chesterton-thursday
you are what,chesterton-thursday
i suppose i ought to arrest you,chesterton-thursday
this devil from whom he had been fleeing all day was only an elder brother of his own house who on the other side of the table lay back and laughed at him,chesterton-thursday
syme s egotism held hard to the first course for a few seconds and then suddenly adopted the third,chesterton-thursday
at myself answered syme and went off again into the agony of his ecstatic reaction,chesterton-thursday
my milk,chesterton-thursday
great blazes,chesterton-thursday
i can t take my face off here replied professor de worms,chesterton-thursday
yes answered the other dispassionately,chesterton-thursday
the false professor drank and wiped his false beard,chesterton-thursday
i knew no more than the dead replied the man who called himself de worms,chesterton-thursday
syme struck the table with an exclamation,chesterton-thursday
the face of professor de worms darkened and he did not look up,chesterton-thursday
no said the professor with sobriety not if we were three hundred against sunday,chesterton-thursday
are you afraid of this man,chesterton-thursday
then he rose to his feet erect like an insulted man and thrust the chair away from him,chesterton-thursday
how,chesterton-thursday
he made an effort to speak but syme went on in a low voice but with an undercurrent of inhuman exaltation,chesterton-thursday
you remember the old tale of the english clergyman who gave the last rites to the brigand of sicily and how on his death bed the great robber said i can give you no money but i can give you advice for a lifetime your thumb on the blade and strike upwards,chesterton-thursday
the decision of his gesture drew the professor vaguely to his feet,chesterton-thursday
no said syme with equal decision,chesterton-thursday
confound it,chesterton-thursday
asked syme with eager eyes,chesterton-thursday
will you join me,chesterton-thursday
i know that it is impossible and i am going to try it and opening the tavern door which let in a blast of bitter air they went out together into the dark streets by the docks,chesterton-thursday
syme inquired,chesterton-thursday
exclaimed syme,chesterton-thursday
on the surrey side at this point there ran out into the thames seeming almost to overhang it a bulk and cluster of those tall tenements dotted with lighted windows and rising like factory chimneys to an almost insane height,chesterton-thursday
we are too late he said the hygienic doctor has gone to bed,chesterton-thursday
come along and get some dinner,chesterton-thursday
i once found a decent place in the west end,chesterton-thursday
through all this ordeal his root horror had been isolation and there are no words to express the abyss between isolation and having one ally,chesterton-thursday
he did it idly and amply in a luxuriant monologue as a man speaks with very old friends,chesterton-thursday
a difference of artistic theory replied the professor pensively,chesterton-thursday
but indeed to say that i am a portrait painter is an inadequate expression,chesterton-thursday
you mean you are made up like him said syme,chesterton-thursday
do explain yourself said syme,chesterton-thursday
in some den of exiled dreamers i was introduced to the great german nihilist philosopher professor de worms,chesterton-thursday
when i met him i was in a frivolous mood and i disliked him so much that i resolved to imitate him,chesterton-thursday
i cannot describe the surprise i felt when my entrance was received with a respectful silence followed when i had first opened my lips with a murmur of admiration,chesterton-thursday
before i could fully recover however two or three of these admirers ran up to me radiating indignation and told me that a public insult had been put upon me in the next room,chesterton-thursday
i need hardly say there was a collision,chesterton-thursday
then he tried to blast my claims intellectually,chesterton-thursday
it is unnecessary for me to say that there never were such people as pinckwerts and glumpe,chesterton-thursday
your claptrap comes off he said so would your beard,chesterton-thursday
his apparent earnestness and anger you see make him all the more entertaining,chesterton-thursday
he told me i was wanted,chesterton-thursday
this charge if it was criminal at all was certainly the lighter of the two and i went along with the man doubtful but not greatly dismayed,chesterton-thursday
i know he said because you talked to him in a dark room,chesterton-thursday
you don t look as if it were said syme you drink it as if it were medicine,chesterton-thursday
the most buoyant exclamations leap up in my heart but they come out of my mouth quite different,chesterton-thursday
you are a very clever fellow he said it is a pleasure to work with you,chesterton-thursday
yes said syme in simple wonder i m supposed to have a good touch,chesterton-thursday
thank you said syme you flatter me,chesterton-thursday
he has not perhaps the white hot enthusiasm unto death the mad martyrdom for anarchy which marks the secretary,chesterton-thursday
depend on it sunday was not asleep i wonder if he ever sleeps,chesterton-thursday
i mentioned the piano because it gives one quick and independent fingers,chesterton-thursday
but wine and companionship had always the effect of inspiring him to a farcical ingenuity and the professor soon found himself struggling with the too vast energy of the new language as it passed through the heated brain of syme,chesterton-thursday
you don t know how serious this is,chesterton-thursday
bull as a revolutionist you remember that a tyrant once advised us to eat grass and indeed many of us looking on the fresh lush grass of summer,chesterton-thursday
i suppose we could not extend it from the fingers to the toes,chesterton-thursday
syme sat up in bed blinking then slowly collected his thoughts threw off the bed clothes and stood up,chesterton-thursday
the professor made no answer but gazed in front of him with eyes the colour of a wintry sea so syme repeated his question,chesterton-thursday
how long did it take you,chesterton-thursday
syme stood staring back at the stiff face like parchment and the blank blue eyes,chesterton-thursday
was this man s silence a sensational way of declaring war,chesterton-thursday
though the professor himself stood there as voiceless as a statue his five dumb fingers were dancing alive upon the dead table,chesterton-thursday
all right,chesterton-thursday
at about every other flight they passed a window each window showed them a pale and tragic dawn lifting itself laboriously over london,chesterton-thursday
but it was not the hot horror of a dream or of anything that might be exaggeration or delusion,chesterton-thursday
and when they entered dr bull s bare garret it was full of light,chesterton-thursday
yet when he was seen properly the french fancy fell away,chesterton-thursday
and indeed if ever death himself sat writing at a wooden table it might have been he,chesterton-thursday
you have no doubt made all the arrangements for the paris affair,chesterton-thursday
comrade syme and i have had an experience which it would take more time to recount than we can afford if we are to act on it,chesterton-thursday
the doctor s smile and silence were not at all like the cataleptic stare and horrible silence which he had confronted in the professor half an hour before,chesterton-thursday
under the increasing sunlight the colours of the doctor s complexion the pattern of his tweeds grew and expanded outrageously as such things grow too important in a realistic novel,chesterton-thursday
this devil has sucked me dry,chesterton-thursday
under this influence he became friendly and told me in so many words that within a day or two they hope to arrest the marquis in france,chesterton-thursday
it seems to me unquestionably urgent that,chesterton-thursday
syme telegraphed it is quite extraordinary,chesterton-thursday
as he said he had an intuition and it had risen to a sort of lightheaded certainty,chesterton-thursday
the professor then resumed his merely verbal monologue addressed to the doctor,chesterton-thursday
he leant across the table and said in a voice that could not be neglected,chesterton-thursday
would you be so kind as to take off your spectacles,chesterton-thursday
then dr bull rose slowly still smiling and took off his spectacles,chesterton-thursday
and indeed it was almost as great a transformation scene,chesterton-thursday
it was the spectacles that did it,chesterton-thursday
project be damned,chesterton-thursday
syme,chesterton-thursday
the professor still feared that all was lost but he was loyal,chesterton-thursday
clapping a brisk bowler on his head and resuming his goblin glasses the doctor moved so quickly towards the door that the others instinctively followed him,chesterton-thursday
no said the voice we were not four against three we were not so lucky,chesterton-thursday
i ve been half dead with the jumps being quite alone,chesterton-thursday
the young man laughed delightedly,chesterton-thursday
you see i wanted to go into the detective service especially the anti dynamite business,chesterton-thursday
but as last i was brought before some old josser who was high up in the force and who seemed to have no end of a head on his shoulders,chesterton-thursday
put him on a pair of smoked spectacles and children will scream at the sight of him,chesterton-thursday
what was that,chesterton-thursday
how was that,chesterton-thursday
i could not have conceived it said syme gravely,chesterton-thursday
they were already on the calais boat before conversation flowed freely,chesterton-thursday
whenever i tried to slip out of it i saw the president somewhere smiling out of the bow window of a club or taking off his hat to me from the top of an omnibus,chesterton-thursday
yes answered the new guide i ve timed it all,chesterton-thursday
theoretically i suppose we ought to call the police,chesterton-thursday
it s like breaking one s word to a child,chesterton-thursday
if i did that i shouldn t know the difference between right and wrong,chesterton-thursday
well i can t turn on a man like that and hunt him down,chesterton-thursday
eh,chesterton-thursday
well said syme it seems that we have all the same kind of morality or immorality so we had better face the fact that comes of it,chesterton-thursday
but we are worse off than that first because they can appeal to their organization and we cannot appeal to ours and second because,chesterton-thursday
i have turned over twenty schemes in my head,chesterton-thursday
he has a whole bodyguard of friends he is very strong and brave and the event is doubtful,chesterton-thursday
asked the professor,chesterton-thursday
the motto varies,chesterton-thursday
the house of st eustache also is very ancient,chesterton-thursday
they went on shore under the strong sun in a sort of daze,chesterton-thursday
chapter x,chesterton-thursday
he professed to be making out a plan of the conversation which was going to ensue between himself and the deadly marquis,chesterton-thursday
i shall say the marquis de saint eustache i believe,chesterton-thursday
pull yourself together and chuck away that bit of paper,chesterton-thursday
i like to be just to my enemy,chesterton-thursday
has it by any chance occurred to you asked the professor with a ponderous simplicity that the marquis may not say all the forty three things you have put down for him,chesterton-thursday
you will make a name,chesterton-thursday
and so i will by george,chesterton-thursday
the man had two companions now solemn frenchmen in frock coats and silk hats one of them with the red rosette of the legion of honour evidently people of a solid social position,chesterton-thursday
are you going to address the meeting,chesterton-thursday
i am going to pull that meeting s great ugly mahogany coloured nose,chesterton-thursday
and you are the marquis de saint eustache he said gracefully,chesterton-thursday
insulted you,chesterton-thursday
exclaimed the gentleman incredulously,chesterton-thursday
ah it was what he said,chesterton-thursday
my aunt played wagner badly,chesterton-thursday
this is nonsense,chesterton-thursday
my aunt s was red,chesterton-thursday
seeking a quarrel with me,chesterton-thursday
these gentlemen will perhaps act for me,chesterton-thursday
permit me to consult for a moment with the gentlemen in whose hands i shall place myself,chesterton-thursday
but look here and listen carefully,chesterton-thursday
he can t refuse to meet you on such a small point of time and place,chesterton-thursday
then perhaps he may kill me to console his feelings,chesterton-thursday
he had correctly calculated in this case the policy of his opponent,chesterton-thursday
but it might have struck a stranger as odd that there appeared in his train not only his seconds carrying the sword case but two of his servants carrying a portmanteau and a luncheon basket,chesterton-thursday
on his right was a little wood far away to his left lay the long curve of the railway line which he was so to speak guarding from the marquis whose goal and escape it was,chesterton-thursday
in twenty minutes the paris train would have gone by,chesterton-thursday
but there was no smoke on the horizon,chesterton-thursday
the seconds stood on each side of the line of fight with drawn swords also but still sombre in their dark frock coats and hats,chesterton-thursday
he remembered them clearly and in order as mere delusions of the nerves how the fear of the professor had been the fear of the tyrannic accidents of nightmare and how the fear of the doctor had been the fear of the airless vacuum of science,chesterton-thursday
he felt a strange and vivid value in all the earth around him in the grass under his feet he felt the love of life in all living things,chesterton-thursday
once his enemy s point ran along his wrist leaving a slight streak of blood but it either was not noticed or was tacitly ignored,chesterton-thursday
the attack came so fast and furious that the one shining sword seemed a shower of shining arrows,chesterton-thursday
syme s sword actually bent under the weight of the marquis s body which it had pierced,chesterton-thursday
the marquis was probably in a general sense a better fencer than he as he had surmised at the beginning but at the moment the marquis seemed distraught and at a disadvantage,chesterton-thursday
it came out clean,chesterton-thursday
but this new spiritual dread was a more awful thing than had been the mere spiritual topsy turvydom symbolised by the paralytic who pursued him,chesterton-thursday
perhaps he had been chosen as a champion of all these fresh and kindly things to cross swords with the enemy of all creation,chesterton-thursday
his thoughts rose higher and higher with the rising roar of the train which ended as if proudly in a long and piercing whistle,chesterton-thursday
said the marquis in a voice that compelled a momentary obedience,chesterton-thursday
there has been foul play somewhere said dr bull who was a little pale,chesterton-thursday
mr syme he continued turning to his opponent we are fighting today if i remember right because you expressed a wish which i thought irrational to pull my nose,chesterton-thursday
there is i think one case on record captain bellegarde and the baron zumpt in which the weapons were changed in the middle of the encounter at the request of one of the combatants,chesterton-thursday
you wanted to do it do it,chesterton-thursday
the paris train panting and groaning had grated into a little station behind the neighbouring hill,chesterton-thursday
the marquis broke the silence in a loud and cheerful voice,chesterton-thursday
oh i know i know,chesterton-thursday
it shall go out without you,chesterton-thursday
he cried,chesterton-thursday
he said without taking breath,chesterton-thursday
we know all said the professor sternly,chesterton-thursday
did you really think i wanted to catch that train,chesterton-thursday
what did i care about,chesterton-thursday
mental lucidity fulfils itself in many ways,chesterton-thursday
us,chesterton-thursday
the head which emerged was the blonde well brushed smooth haired head which is common in the english constabulary but the face was terribly pale,chesterton-thursday
oh don t show it us he said wearily we ve got enough of them to equip a paper chase,chesterton-thursday
you have not wasted your time you have helped to save the world,chesterton-thursday
of course i accept the apology but you will in your turn forgive me if i decline to follow you further into your difficulties and permit myself to say good morning,chesterton-thursday
i won t,chesterton-thursday
sunday,chesterton-thursday
with the people out of that train said the other,chesterton-thursday
what can it mean,chesterton-thursday
don t you know that his jokes are always so big and simple that one has never thought of them,chesterton-thursday
but there were just five people perhaps who would have resisted him,chesterton-thursday
sunday knew that the professor would chase syme through london and that syme would fight me in france,chesterton-thursday
he has probably captured the world it only remains to him to capture this field and all the fools in it,chesterton-thursday
but they were too distant to be distinguished in any way,chesterton-thursday
he handed the field glasses to the doctor who immediately took off his spectacles and put the apparatus to his eyes,chesterton-thursday
most men in the advancing mob really looked ordinary enough but it was quite true that two or three of the leaders in front wore black half masks almost down to their mouths,chesterton-thursday
syme put the field glasses from his eyes with an almost ghastly relief,chesterton-thursday
answered syme somewhat irritably,chesterton-thursday
i believe this ground would shake,chesterton-thursday
this is absurd,chesterton-thursday
but let me tell you frankly that they are precisely calculated to our value we are not much my boy in sunday s universe,chesterton-thursday
with these words he turned his broad back and strode with silent energy towards the wood,chesterton-thursday
so in plunging into the wood they had a cool shock of shadow as of divers who plunge into a dim pool,chesterton-thursday
the ex marquis had pulled the old straw hat over his eyes and the black shade of the brim cut his face so squarely in two that it seemed to be wearing one of the black half masks of their pursuers,chesterton-thursday
this wood of witchery in which men s faces turned black and white by turns in which their figures first swelled into sunlight and then faded into formless night this mere chaos of chiaroscuro after the clear daylight outside seemed to syme a perfect symbol of the world in which he had been moving for three days this world where men took off their beards and their spectacles and their noses and turned into other people,chesterton-thursday
might he not just as well take off his head and turn out to be a hobgoblin,chesterton-thursday
as a man in an evil dream strains himself to scream and wake syme strove with a sudden effort to fling off this last and worst of his fancies,chesterton-thursday
we must get down through the town of lancy to the sea he said,chesterton-thursday
surely not many working men are anarchists and surely if they were mere mobs could not beat modern armies and police,chesterton-thursday
why should it,chesterton-thursday
aristocrats were always anarchists as you can see from the barons wars,chesterton-thursday
but getting hold of a few wicked old gentlemen with hobbies is one thing getting hold of great christian nations is another,chesterton-thursday
burnt by the sun and stained with perspiration and grave with the bottomless gravity of small necessary toils a heavy french peasant was cutting wood with a hatchet,chesterton-thursday
but i forgot that in your country you are not used to peasants being wealthy,chesterton-thursday
oh give him anything,chesterton-thursday
began bull impatiently,chesterton-thursday
at the end of the four minutes however they saw that the colonel was right for the wood cutter entered into their plans not with the vague servility of a tout too well paid but with the seriousness of a solicitor who had been paid the proper fee,chesterton-thursday
one man s presence had sufficed for them they had fled at the first sight of the deformed smile of the secretary,chesterton-thursday
they seemed to be dressed in dark clothes and plain hats like any common crowd out of the streets but they did not spread and sprawl and trail by various lines to the attack as would be natural in an ordinary mob,chesterton-thursday
he is perhaps five hundred miles off but the fear of him is on all of them like the finger of god,chesterton-thursday
the level of the sunlit landscape though flat as a whole fell away on the farther side of the wood in billows of heavy slope towards the sea in a way not unlike the lower slopes of the sussex downs,chesterton-thursday
the peasant grunted an apology and got down from his seat,chesterton-thursday
the military decision of his action interested syme who sat next to him and he took the opportunity when the old innkeeper had gone out of satisfying his curiosity,chesterton-thursday
horses,chesterton-thursday
beyond question replied the colonel you had better make all haste to the police station beyond the town,chesterton-thursday
syme looked up at the wall and saw a crudely painted and pathetic religious picture,chesterton-thursday
i had no idea that the anarchists had so much discipline,chesterton-thursday
by this time the afternoon sun was slanting westward and by its rays syme could see the sturdy figure of the old innkeeper growing smaller and smaller but still standing and looking after them quite silently the sunshine in his silver hair,chesterton-thursday
the horses had been saddled none too soon,chesterton-thursday
the colonel suggested that before making finally for the police station they should make the effort in passing to attach to themselves one more individual who might be useful,chesterton-thursday
doctor renard s house is only three minutes off said the colonel,chesterton-thursday
yes he is quite on your side,chesterton-thursday
then all their ears in an agony of attention heard along the road that indescribable thrill and throb that means only one thing horses,chesterton-thursday
asked syme as he mechanically urged his steed to a canter,chesterton-thursday
not with all that white hair,chesterton-thursday
they breathed again to see that the road as yet was clear and they rang the bell,chesterton-thursday
they all looked round and saw a curve of black cavalry come sweeping over the top of the hill with all the energy of attila,chesterton-thursday
i am sorry to cut short a cultured discussion said the colonel but can you lend me your motor car now in two minutes,chesterton-thursday
this with some difficulty they brought round into the street before the doctor s house,chesterton-thursday
i hear horses,chesterton-thursday
he bent his strength upon one handle and then said quite quietly,chesterton-thursday
it was the secretary and his mouth went quite straight in the solemnity of triumph,chesterton-thursday
i can t understand why it has grown so dark said the professor at last in a low voice,chesterton-thursday
where on earth did you get that,chesterton-thursday
he looked up blinking amiably at the beautiful arched ceiling of his own front hall,chesterton-thursday
you were said syme seriously and hung the heavy lantern over the front,chesterton-thursday
these lights make one feel more cheerful,chesterton-thursday
oh this is all raving nonsense,chesterton-thursday
we shall see,chesterton-thursday
i thought we had got clear of them,chesterton-thursday
i tell you they were his he repeated with wild eyes and they were full of men in masks,chesterton-thursday
the whole town is on their side,chesterton-thursday
the thing is nonsense,chesterton-thursday
said the colonel someone has shot at us,chesterton-thursday
he rolled his eyes all round the street,chesterton-thursday
no said inspector ratcliffe we shall never get there,chesterton-thursday
i mean that we shall never get there said the pessimist placidly,chesterton-thursday
syme had slowed down the car as their plans became doubtful and he brought it finally to a standstill just at the corner of a side street that ran down very steeply to the sea,chesterton-thursday
then syme whose eyes were the keenest broke into a little bitter whistle and said,chesterton-thursday
get on a bit syme and let us look at them,chesterton-thursday
how do you know,chesterton-thursday
there was indeed a rank of dim figures running across the road and they could not be clearly seen but far enough in front to catch the accident of the evening light was stalking up and down the unmistakable dr renard in a white hat stroking his long brown beard and holding a revolver in his left hand,chesterton-thursday
he jumped out of the car and ran across the intervening space calling out,chesterton-thursday
for the philanthropic dr renard had deliberately raised his revolver and fired twice at bull so that the shots rang down the road,chesterton-thursday
i think said dr bull with precision that i am lying in bed at no,chesterton-thursday
no sir i m a democrat and i still don t believe that sunday could convert one average navvy or counter jumper,chesterton-thursday
and you re right enough about humanity about peasants and people like that jolly old innkeeper,chesterton-thursday
they are really destroyed now said the man with a cigarette and rose with his hands in his pockets,chesterton-thursday
it must be a practical joke,chesterton-thursday
cried the colonel stamping,chesterton-thursday
but the impatient colonel was already out of earshot advancing towards the advancing enemy,chesterton-thursday
we may all be killed but we must kill a tidy number of them,chesterton-thursday
asked the professor,chesterton-thursday
he saw above the foremost saddle the silver gleam of a sword and then as it grew nearer the silver gleam of an old man s hair,chesterton-thursday
said syme as his own car went down the darkness like a falling star,chesterton-thursday
what are we going to do,chesterton-thursday
well we smashed something said the professor with a faint smile,chesterton-thursday
syme snatched a sword and took it in his teeth he stuck two others under his arm pits took a fourth in his left hand and the lantern in his right and leapt off the high parade on to the beach below,chesterton-thursday
but there s a pier or breakwater runs out into the sea just here which we could defend longer than anything else like horatius and his bridge,chesterton-thursday
they turned and faced the town,chesterton-thursday
two or three men looking little and black like monkeys leapt over the edge as they had done and dropped on to the beach,chesterton-thursday
the peasant,chesterton-thursday
said bull desperately there must be some people left in the town who are human,chesterton-thursday
nor public flame nor private dares to shine nor human light is left nor glimpse divine,chesterton-thursday
the low lights of the police station were indeed blotted and broken with hurrying figures and they heard through the darkness the clash and jingle of a disciplined cavalry,chesterton-thursday
yes said ratcliffe and they are going to fire on us,chesterton-thursday
there was a long silence and then ratcliffe said looking out over the swollen sea all a sort of grey purple,chesterton-thursday
mr ratcliffe kept a stony silence then at last he said quietly,chesterton-thursday
asked syme with curiosity,chesterton-thursday
i heard what you said said the professor with his back turned,chesterton-thursday
the colonel,chesterton-thursday
do not pity the colonel said ratcliffe with a pale sneer,chesterton-thursday
no,chesterton-thursday
many of their pursuers had waded into the water shaking their fists but the sea was rough and they could not reach the pier,chesterton-thursday
they were in earnest consultation,chesterton-thursday
i feel as if my own hand might fly up and strike me,chesterton-thursday
judas before herod,chesterton-thursday
do you see the cross carved on it and the flame inside,chesterton-thursday
you can only destroy,chesterton-thursday
he struck the secretary once with the lantern so that he staggered and then whirling it twice round his head sent it flying far out to sea where it flared like a roaring rocket and fell,chesterton-thursday
syme s sword was broken but he rent a bludgeon from the fist of a fisherman flinging him down,chesterton-thursday
there is some mistake he said,chesterton-thursday
certainly,chesterton-thursday
you said the secretary stiffly are as i know for a fact members of the supreme anarchist council,chesterton-thursday
and all these nice people who have been peppering us with shot thought we were the dynamiters,chesterton-thursday
chapter xiii,chesterton-thursday
the five reconciled detectives had a hundred details to explain to each other,chesterton-thursday
if they were all harmless officers what was sunday,chesterton-thursday
damn it,chesterton-thursday
i suppose you are right said the professor reflectively,chesterton-thursday
throughout their whole journey by boat and train they were highly convivial but they instinctively kept together,chesterton-thursday
twenty minutes afterwards however he came back and made quite a clamour in the hall,chesterton-thursday
asked syme quickly,chesterton-thursday
asked syme impatiently,chesterton-thursday
you have expelled me as a spy,chesterton-thursday
come and have a drink,chesterton-thursday
they turned in silence into the square and though the hotel was in the opposite corner they saw at once the little balcony and a figure that looked too big for it,chesterton-thursday
my reason is quite simple said syme,chesterton-thursday
so pleased to see you all,chesterton-thursday
i bring you news of no such disgusting spectacles,chesterton-thursday
of course we all have our opinions and even our eyes but really to call them disgusting before the man himself,chesterton-thursday
i dare say it will grow on me some day,chesterton-thursday
why did you get us all here,chesterton-thursday
as far as i can make out you want me to tell you what i am and what you are and what this table is and what this council is and what this world is for all i know,chesterton-thursday
what am i,chesterton-thursday
syme you are a poet,chesterton-thursday
but i have never been caught yet and the skies will fall in the time i turn to bay,chesterton-thursday
i am the man in the dark room who made you all policemen,chesterton-thursday
but syme was in no mood for delicacies and he stood up in his own cab shouting stop thief,chesterton-thursday
then standing up in front of the cab himself he lashed the horse and roared aloud so that they went down the streets like a flying storm,chesterton-thursday
then raising his right hand swiftly he flung a ball of paper in syme s face and vanished,chesterton-thursday
what does the old maniac mean,chesterton-thursday
but for the last time where are your goloshes,chesterton-thursday
but quick as it went by sunday had bounded out of his cab sprung at the fire engine caught it slung himself on to it and was seen as he disappeared in the noisy distance talking to the astonished fireman with explanatory gestures,chesterton-thursday
the three cabmen who had been stunned for a moment whipped up their horses and slightly decreased the distance between themselves and their disappearing prey,chesterton-thursday
a friend,chesterton-thursday
what place can this be,chesterton-thursday
no but it isn t that said syme knitting his brows,chesterton-thursday
geraniums barking,chesterton-thursday
well listen to that he said is that a dog anybody s dog,chesterton-thursday
the others followed,chesterton-thursday
has it come this way,chesterton-thursday
cried the keeper,chesterton-thursday
a very large and fat old gentleman in light grey clothes said the keeper eagerly,chesterton-thursday
there was no doubt about it this time,chesterton-thursday
he ll be out of the gate,chesterton-thursday
great lord,chesterton-thursday
he remembered especially seeing pelicans with their preposterous pendant throats,chesterton-thursday
he wondered whether even the archangels understood the hornbill,chesterton-thursday
it was addressed to himself and was quite a bulky parcel,chesterton-thursday
through street after street through district after district went the prodigy of the flying elephant calling crowds to every window and driving the traffic left and right,chesterton-thursday
the beast outstripped the cabs,chesterton-thursday
asked syme slipping to the ground,chesterton-thursday
he held out with distaste a piece of folded paper addressed to the secretary of the central anarchist council,chesterton-thursday
do people commonly come to you exhibition riding on mad elephants,chesterton-thursday
look at what,chesterton-thursday
demanded the secretary,chesterton-thursday
ten thousand devils,chesterton-thursday
god bless my soul,chesterton-thursday
your beauty has not left me indifferent from little snowdrop,chesterton-thursday
chapter xiv,chesterton-thursday
consequently the tireless though exasperated travellers broke through black thickets and ploughed through ploughed fields till each was turned into a figure too outrageous to be mistaken for a tramp,chesterton-thursday
said the professor,chesterton-thursday
said the vindictive professor hurt him,chesterton-thursday
cried the secretary bitterly,chesterton-thursday
i can t wish old sunday s balloon to burst because,chesterton-thursday
but i don t care who knows it i always had a sympathy for old sunday himself wicked as he was,chesterton-thursday
you will not said the secretary,chesterton-thursday
moderate strength is shown in violence supreme strength is shown in levity,chesterton-thursday
there is a kind of gaiety in the thing as if he were bursting with some good news,chesterton-thursday
,chesterton-thursday
,chesterton-thursday
,chesterton-thursday
i was a fierce fellow and a trifle morbid from the first,chesterton-thursday
he sat there on a bench a huge heap of a man dark and out of shape,chesterton-thursday
it reminded me of everything i had ever read about the base bodies that are the origin of life the deep sea lumps and protoplasm,chesterton-thursday
it is no small thing to be laughed at by something at once lower and stronger than oneself,chesterton-thursday
but i ll tell you what is a trifle creepy about sunday,chesterton-thursday
we think of a wicked man as vigilant,chesterton-thursday
that is what tries the nerves abstraction combined with cruelty,chesterton-thursday
asked syme,chesterton-thursday
wake up professor,chesterton-thursday
or rather i think something that i cannot even think clearly,chesterton-thursday
the eye was so far away from the nose that it wasn t an eye,chesterton-thursday
walking up a road at night i have seen a lamp and a lighted window and a cloud make together a most complete and unmistakable face,chesterton-thursday
i don t know whether your face bull is a face or a combination in perspective,chesterton-thursday
my poor dear bull i do not believe that you really have a face,chesterton-thursday
bull finds him like the earth in spring gogol like the sun at noonday,chesterton-thursday
when i first saw sunday said syme slowly i only saw his back and when i saw his back i knew he was the worst man in the world,chesterton-thursday
and then the queer thing happened,chesterton-thursday
syme exclaimed the secretary are you ill,chesterton-thursday
pan said the professor dreamily was a god and an animal,chesterton-thursday
but the whole came to a kind of crest yesterday when i raced sunday for the cab and was just behind him all the way,chesterton-thursday
and i fancied that the figure running in front of me was really a figure running backwards and dancing as he ran,chesterton-thursday
and yet ten minutes afterwards when he put his head out of the cab and made a grimace like a gargoyle i knew that he was only like a father playing hide and seek with his children,chesterton-thursday
we see everything from behind and it looks brutal,chesterton-thursday
look,chesterton-thursday
he is dead,chesterton-thursday
you will not find him dead easily,chesterton-thursday
said dr bull irritably,chesterton-thursday
syme had stood without hearing any of the exclamations,chesterton-thursday
it would be like one of his larks,chesterton-thursday
he was clad in a fine but old fashioned suit with knee breeches its colour was that shade between blue violet and grey which can be seen in certain shadows of the woodland,chesterton-thursday
asked syme standing quite still,chesterton-thursday
my master has only just come home,chesterton-thursday
as the six wanderers broke out upon this thoroughfare they saw the white road blocked by what looked like a long row of carriages such a row of carriages as might close the approach to some house in park lane,chesterton-thursday
asked bull of syme as they separated,chesterton-thursday
they had all become inured to things going roughly but things suddenly going smoothly swamped them,chesterton-thursday
very gradually and very vaguely he realised into what rich roads the carriage was carrying him,chesterton-thursday
then his carriage took a turn of the path and he saw suddenly and quietly like a long low sunset cloud a long low house mellow in the mild light of sunset,chesterton-thursday
refreshments are provided for you in your room,chesterton-thursday
exactly at the same moment a man in blue who had been appointed as his valet said very solemnly,chesterton-thursday
my master asks me to say said the attendant that there is a fancy dress ball tonight and that he desires you to put on the costume that i have laid out,chesterton-thursday
the servant lifted off a kind of ottoman a long peacock blue drapery rather of the nature of a domino on the front of which was emblazoned a large golden sun and which was splashed here and there with flaming stars and crescents,chesterton-thursday
oh yes sir said the other eagerly the thursday costume is quite warm sir,chesterton-thursday
those orbs i think shine on other days,chesterton-thursday
here however they reckoned from a christian sunday,chesterton-thursday
shall i help you on with your costume,chesterton-thursday
for these disguises did not disguise but reveal,chesterton-thursday
he was draped in a long robe of starless black down the centre of which fell a band or broad stripe of pure white like a single shaft of light,chesterton-thursday
no smell of ale or orchards could make the secretary cease to ask a reasonable question,chesterton-thursday
as they descended the broad stairs together they overtook ratcliffe who was clad in spring green like a huntsman and the pattern upon whose garment was a green tangle of trees,chesterton-thursday
syme even saw with a queer thrill one dancer dressed like an enormous hornbill with a beak twice as big as himself the queer bird which had fixed itself on his fancy like a living question while he was rushing down the long road at the zoological gardens,chesterton-thursday
on one side of this lawn alive with dancers was a sort of green bank like the terrace in such old fashioned gardens,chesterton-thursday
dr bull the last day of creation wore a coat covered with heraldic animals in red and gold and on his crest a man rampant,chesterton-thursday
the men for whom these thrones were reserved were men crowned with some extraordinary laurels,chesterton-thursday
almost as syme heard the words he saw on the sea of human faces in front of him a frightful and beautiful alteration as if heaven had opened behind his head,chesterton-thursday
at last however the thick crowd began to thin itself,chesterton-thursday
soon there were only some ten loiterers in the garden soon only four,chesterton-thursday
they seemed in no haste to do so but heard in silence the hum of insects and the distant song of one bird,chesterton-thursday
whether it was but recently for time is nothing or at the beginning of the world i sent you out to war,chesterton-thursday
syme stirred sharply in his seat but otherwise there was silence and the incomprehensible went on,chesterton-thursday
there was complete silence in the starlit garden and then the black browed secretary implacable turned in his chair towards sunday and said in a harsh voice,chesterton-thursday
i know what you mean he cried and it is exactly that that i cannot forgive you,chesterton-thursday
we wept we fled in terror the iron entered into our souls and you are the peace of god,chesterton-thursday
but i should like to know,chesterton-thursday
bull said,chesterton-thursday
and then gogol said with the absolute simplicity of a child,chesterton-thursday
and here i think comes another to complain and we will hear him also,chesterton-thursday
it was only when he had come quite close to the crescent of the seven and flung up his face to look at them that syme saw with thunder struck clearness that the face was the broad almost ape like face of his old friend gregory with its rank red hair and its insulting smile,chesterton-thursday
now there was a day murmured bull who seemed really to have fallen asleep when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them,chesterton-thursday
oh most unhappy man he cried try to be happy,chesterton-thursday
then out of this unintelligible creature the last thunders broke,chesterton-thursday
you are the police the great fat smiling men in blue and buttons,chesterton-thursday
the only crime of the government is that it governs,chesterton-thursday
you sit in your chairs of stone and have never come down from them,chesterton-thursday
why does each thing on the earth war against each other thing,chesterton-thursday
so that each thing that obeys law may have the glory and isolation of the anarchist,chesterton-thursday
we have been broken upon the wheel,chesterton-thursday
i can answer for every one of the great guards of law whom he has accused,chesterton-thursday
it grew larger and larger filling the whole sky then everything went black,chesterton-thursday
for while he could always remember afterwards that he had swooned before the face of sunday he could not remember having ever come to at all,chesterton-thursday
he felt he was in possession of some impossible good news which made every other thing a triviality but an adorable triviality,chesterton-thursday
he walked by instinct along one white road on which early birds hopped and sang and found himself outside a fenced garden,chesterton-thursday
as long as she was able to work she was very industrious and was accounted the best spinner in the parish but she overworked herself at last and fell ill so that she could not sit to her wheel as she used to do and was obliged to give it up to her eldest daughter mary,edgeworth-parents
mary stopped her wheel for she was afraid that the noise of it had wakened her mother and would hinder her from going to sleep again,edgeworth-parents
and so you will be again i hope said mary when the fine weather comes again,edgeworth-parents
here the children who had finished eating their suppers came round the bed to listen to what their mother was saying,edgeworth-parents
at the end of the week she was dead and buried and the orphans were left alone in their cabin,edgeworth-parents
her first care was to pay those debts which her mother had mentioned to her for which she left money done up carefully in separate papers,edgeworth-parents
a hard hearted man,edgeworth-parents
mary could not bear the thoughts of begging any of the neighbours to take her and her brother and sisters in for charity s sake for the neighbours were all poor enough themselves,edgeworth-parents
the chest was carried for them by some of the charitable neighbours who likewise added to their scanty stock of potatoes and turf what would make it last through the winter,edgeworth-parents
mary went to her and took her goat along with her and offered it in part of payment of the debt but the schoolmistress would not receive the goat,edgeworth-parents
she offered a penny for the paper but the master would not take anything from her but gave her the paper when he found that she wanted it to make a garland for her mother s grave,edgeworth-parents
mother,edgeworth-parents
it was at the house of the schoolmistress that they stopped and she gave them a good account of these orphans,edgeworth-parents
isabella after telling mary what an excellent character she had heard of her inquired what it was she most wanted and mary said that she had just worked up all her flax and she was most in want of more flax for her wheel,edgeworth-parents
when the winter nights came on he used to light his rush candles for mary to work by,edgeworth-parents
edmund who was ready to oblige and proud that his candles were noticed showed the englishman how they were made and gave him a bundle of rushes,edgeworth-parents
decayed labourers women and children make it their business to procure and prepare them,edgeworth-parents
the servant was pleased with his good nature in this trifling instance and remembered it long after it was forgotten by edmund,edgeworth-parents
but he told exactly the truth and though gilbert scolded him for being so impatient as not to wait yet his telling the truth was more to the boy s advantage than any excuse he could have made,edgeworth-parents
they did not grow idle or wasteful,edgeworth-parents
he was mindful to do all that mr gilbert required of him and he was so obliging to all his fellow servants that they could not help liking him,edgeworth-parents
the author has seen a pair of shoes such as here described made in a few hours,edgeworth-parents
her brother advised her to try platted packthread instead of hemp for the soles and she found that this looked more neat than the hemp soles and was likely to last longer,edgeworth-parents
the young ladies as soon as they had collected the money walked to the old castle where they found everything neat and clean as usual,edgeworth-parents
edmund was allowed to come home for an hour every morning provided he was back again before eight o clock,edgeworth-parents
she however in the midst of her hurry found time to make a very pretty pair with neat roses as a present for her schoolmistress who now that she saw her pupil in a good way of business consented to receive the amount of her old debt,edgeworth-parents
one morning edmund and the little manufacturers were assembled very early and they were busy at their work all sitting round the meal chest which served them for a table,edgeworth-parents
they were in a sort of outer court of the castle next to the room in which all their companions were at work and they ran precipitately into the room exclaiming did you hear that noise,edgeworth-parents
the part of the castle in which they lived seemed as edmund said to be perfectly safe but the children of the village were terrified and thinking that the whole would come tumbling down directly they ran to their homes as fast as they could,edgeworth-parents
she found that there was one newly built house in this village unoccupied it belonged to mr harvey her landlord who was still in england it was slated and neatly fitted up inside but the rent of it was six guineas a year and this was far above what mary could afford to pay,edgeworth-parents
he offered to give a guinea yearly towards the rent out of his wages and mr gilbert spoke about it for him to the steward and inquired whether amongst any of those who had given in proposals there might not be one who would be content with a part of the house and who would join with mary in paying the rent,edgeworth-parents
bad news for you peggy cried she as soon as she got home,edgeworth-parents
we cannot lift the stone from off her it is so heavy,edgeworth-parents
as they were moving away this stone in order to bury the goat anne found an odd looking piece of money which seemed neither like a halfpenny nor a shilling nor a guinea,edgeworth-parents
never was anything so lucky,edgeworth-parents
it is not only by their superior riches but it is yet more by their superior knowledge that persons in the higher rank of life may assist those in a lower condition,edgeworth-parents
they also begged that their father who was well acquainted with mr harvey the gentleman to whom rossmore castle belonged to write to him and tell him how well these orphans had behaved about the treasure which they had found,edgeworth-parents
this old woman was well known amongst the country people by the name of goody grope because she had for many years been in the habit of groping in old castles and in moats and at the bottom of a round tower in the neighbourhood in search of treasure,edgeworth-parents
goody is not a word used in ireland,edgeworth-parents
besides to comfort herself for her disappointments and to give her spirits for fresh searches she took to drinking,edgeworth-parents
mary immediately set before her some milk and picked a good potato out of the bowl for her,edgeworth-parents
when good luck came to you what a shame to turn your back upon it,edgeworth-parents
she set her elbow upon her knees and stopping her ears with her hands bid mary and her sisters not to waste their breath advising their elders for that let them say what they would she would fall to work the next morning barring you ll make it worth my while to let it alone,edgeworth-parents
the next day and the next and the next goody grope came on the same errand and poor mary who could ill afford to supply her constantly with halfpence at last exclaimed i am sure the finding of this treasure has not been any good luck to us but quite the contrary and i wish we never had found it,edgeworth-parents
so he sent over the silver coins and others of little value and apologized for his not having mentioned them before by saying that he considered them as mere rubbish,edgeworth-parents
he replied that it was very likely such coins had been found at rossmore castle and that the ladies alluded to had probably seen them but he positively declared that they never came to his hands that he had restored all that were deposited with him and that as to the others he supposed they must have been taken out of the pot by the children or by edmund or mary on their way from the ladies house to his,edgeworth-parents
does not he remember edmund s counting the things to him upon the great table in his hall and we all standing by,edgeworth-parents
i believe he was afraid i should steal it he twitched it from my hand in such a hurry,edgeworth-parents
true said mary but is not it a hard case that we who have lived as my mother did all her life before us in peace and honesty with all the world should now have our good name taken from us when mary s voice faltered and stopped,edgeworth-parents
the affair was a great deal talked of and the agent spared no pains to have the story told his own way,edgeworth-parents
mistress i d not have had any dealings with you had i known your name sooner,edgeworth-parents
still she exerted herself every day at her little manufacture and she endeavoured to console herself by reflecting that she had two friends left who would not give up her character and who continued steadily to protect her and her sisters,edgeworth-parents
one night as mary was going to bed she heard someone knocking hard at the door,edgeworth-parents
here s a letter just come by post for you and i stepped over to you with it because i guessed you d be glad to have it seeing it is your brother s handwriting,edgeworth-parents
joy i always said the truth would come out at last and that he could not take our good name from us,edgeworth-parents
your joyful and affectionate brother edmund,edgeworth-parents
isabella and caroline knew them again instantly and as the cross which isabella had made on each of them was still visible through a magnifying glass there could be no possibility of doubt,edgeworth-parents
at last when the jew was informed that the coins were stolen and that he would be proceeded against as a receiver of stolen goods if he did not confess the whole truth he declared that he had purchased them from a gentleman whom he had never seen before or since but he added that he could swear to his person if he saw him again,edgeworth-parents
this was the joyful news which edmund had to tell his sisters,edgeworth-parents
it is all luck all luck in this world but i never had no luck,edgeworth-parents
phoo,edgeworth-parents
this house was given to them as a reward for their honesty,edgeworth-parents
the pinks and roses she tied up in nice nosegays and sent either to clifton or bristol to be sold,edgeworth-parents
the winter passed away while she was so weak that she could earn but little by her work and when the summer came her rent was called for and the rent was not ready in her little purse as usual,edgeworth-parents
it will go near to break my jem s heart said dame preston to herself as she sat one evening beside the fire stirring the embers and considering how she had best open the matter to her son who stood opposite to her eating a dry crust of bread very heartily for supper,edgeworth-parents
brave hard,edgeworth-parents
ay upon lightfoot you know mother very easily mayn t i,edgeworth-parents
cried jem swallowing the last mouthful hastily as if he thought he had been too long at supper and now for the great needle i must see and mend lightfoot s bridle afore i go to bed,edgeworth-parents
god bless him that s right,edgeworth-parents
lightfoot,edgeworth-parents
who says you must,edgeworth-parents
said the widow leaning her head upon her arm,edgeworth-parents
but i could earn something though i say cried jem proudly and i will earn something if it be ever so little it will be something and i shall do my very best so i will,edgeworth-parents
and we might make it all up in time for a penny a day might come to two guineas in time,edgeworth-parents
he did not waste his time waiting for her but saddled and bridled lightfoot and went to farmer truck s for the giant strawberries,edgeworth-parents
jem was not however a boy to be easily discouraged he went to the rocks and walked slowly along looking at all the stones as he passed,edgeworth-parents
white and like glass said the man and went on working whilst jem looked very carefully over the heap of rubbish for a great while,edgeworth-parents
one good turn deserves another said the man we are going to dinner just now and shall leave off work wait for me here and i ll make it worth your while,edgeworth-parents
what lawrence,edgeworth-parents
what are you doing there,edgeworth-parents
i don t know because i can t find anybody to play with me to day,edgeworth-parents
and i said jem laughing would not be you for the world to have nothing to do,edgeworth-parents
when he went home to dinner he told his mother his scheme and she smiled and said he might do as he pleased for she was not afraid of his being from home,edgeworth-parents
cried some sailors who had just rowed a boat to land bear a hand here will you my little fellow and carry these parcels for us into yonder house,edgeworth-parents
she was alone in her parlour and was sorting a bundle of feathers of different colours they lay on a sheet of pasteboard upon a window seat and it happened that as the sailor was bustling round the table to show off his shells he knocked down the sheet of pasteboard and scattered all the feathers,edgeworth-parents
she smiled and pleased with his activity and simplicity began to ask him several questions such as who he was where he lived what employment he had and how much a day he earned by gathering fossils,edgeworth-parents
oh thank you ma am said he i will be sure and bring you as many more to morrow,edgeworth-parents
jem did not quite understand what she meant by this but answered i m sure i don t wish to be idle what i want is to earn something every day if i know how i m sure i don t wish to be idle,edgeworth-parents
why mammy s horse added jem looking out of the window i must make haste home and feed him afore it gets dark he ll wonder what s gone with me,edgeworth-parents
said the lady you know there is a great deal of difference between picking up a few stones and working steadily every day and all day long,edgeworth-parents
jem bowed thanked her and went away,edgeworth-parents
wife give the lad two shillings and take this half crown,edgeworth-parents
let him do what he will with it wife said the man,edgeworth-parents
never had so good a little boy about the grounds said the gardener he s always at his work let me come by when i will and he has got twice as much done as another would do yes twice as much ma am for look here he began at this ere rose bush and now he s got to where you stand ma am and here is the day s work that t other boy and he s three years older too did to day i say measure jem s fairly and it s twice as much i m sure,edgeworth-parents
the gardener will mark it off for you and when you ve done the rest of the day you may do what you please,edgeworth-parents
and why don t you play lawrence,edgeworth-parents
oh pugh,edgeworth-parents
come now i m quite fresh again will you have one game at ball,edgeworth-parents
a penny twopence threepence fourpence there s eightpence in all would not you be happy if you had eightpence,edgeworth-parents
you never had more than twopence or threepence at a time in all your life,edgeworth-parents
said lawrence roused so as absolutely to stand upright four and sevenpence have you,edgeworth-parents
and how did you come by it honestly,edgeworth-parents
but four and sevenpence let s see what will you do with it all,edgeworth-parents
i d buy nuts enough to last me from this time to christmas and i d make little newton crack em for me for that s the worst of nuts there s the trouble of cracking em,edgeworth-parents
oh i know very well what to do with it but as i told you that s a secret and i sha n t tell it anybody,edgeworth-parents
in the course of two days he laid out sixpence of his money in apples and gingerbread and as long as these lasted he found himself well received by his companions but at length the third day he spent his last halfpenny and when it was gone unfortunately some nuts tempted him very much but he had no money to pay for them so he ran home to coax his father as he called it,edgeworth-parents
lawrence looked as soon as he came to the use of his senses and with fear amazement and remorse beheld at least a dozen bottles burst and the fine worcestershire cider streaming over the floor,edgeworth-parents
cried his father with renewed anger as another bottle burst at the moment,edgeworth-parents
what had you to think of,edgeworth-parents
but the cider was still fresh in his recollection and the moment lawrence began to whisper the word halfpenny in his ear his father swore with a loud oath i will not give you a halfpenny no not a farthing for a month to come,edgeworth-parents
the fruit woman s stall was at the gate of an inn yard and peeping through the gate in this yard lawrence saw a postilion and a stable boy about his own size playing at pitch farthing,edgeworth-parents
so he stepped forward presenting his halfpenny offering to toss up with the stable boy who after looking him full in the face accepted the proposal and threw his halfpenny into the air,edgeworth-parents
this time lawrence lost he threw again and won and so he went on sometimes losing but most frequently winning till half the morning was lost,edgeworth-parents
here whilst he ate he overheard the conversation of the stable boys and postilions,edgeworth-parents
gaming cheating and lying soon became familiar to him and to complete his ruin he formed a sudden and close intimacy with the stable boy a very bad boy with whom he had first begun to game,edgeworth-parents
what a terrible litter,edgeworth-parents
i am very sorry to hear that said the lady i wish we could find somebody who would do them if he can t,edgeworth-parents
in the first place he recollected that he had seen lazy lawrence whilst he lounged upon the gate twist a bit of heath into different shapes and he thought that if he could find some way of plaiting heath firmly together it would make a very pretty green soft mat which would do very well for one to wipe one s shoes on,edgeworth-parents
what pains did it cost him before he could make anything like a mat,edgeworth-parents
all his play hours the next day he spent at his mat which in all made five hours of fruitless attempts,edgeworth-parents
and now came the grand pleasure of carrying it to his mistress,edgeworth-parents
but that s not all said the lady,edgeworth-parents
in every one he made he found less difficulty so that instead of making two he could soon make four in a day,edgeworth-parents
there is my little boy and his mats cried the lady and followed by all the rest of the company she came into the hall,edgeworth-parents
said the lady well take up your hat and go home then for you see that it is getting late and you know lightfoot will wonder what s become of you,edgeworth-parents
thirty six shillings said the lady five and sevenpence i think you told me you had earned already how much does that make,edgeworth-parents
cried he clapping his hands together o lightfoot,edgeworth-parents
everybody thought however that they had been thanked rightly,edgeworth-parents
he now went home but felt it a great restraint to wait till to morrow evening before he told his mother,edgeworth-parents
they started when they got into the middle of the stable and when they saw jem who had been at first hidden by the horse,edgeworth-parents
but jem looked at the stable boy with dislike and a sort of dread,edgeworth-parents
one day in the year sure there s no harm in being merry said the stable boy,edgeworth-parents
then what will you do with all your money,edgeworth-parents
but how came you to talk of four and sevenpence,edgeworth-parents
you had liked to have blown us all up,edgeworth-parents
but to steal said lawrence drawing back with horror i never thought i should come to that and from poor jem too the money that he has worked so hard for too,edgeworth-parents
we are almost afraid to go on,edgeworth-parents
he knew well who it was for this was the signal agreed upon between him and his wicked companion,edgeworth-parents
he made no answer but got out of the window and followed,edgeworth-parents
i am here give me your hand,edgeworth-parents
it is no time to go back replied the other opening the door you ve gone too far now to go back and he pushed lawrence into the stable,edgeworth-parents
make haste i hear a noise said the stable boy who watched at the door,edgeworth-parents
what do we stand here for,edgeworth-parents
you said you d only take half a crown,edgeworth-parents
all night he was starting from frightful dreams or else broad awake he lay listening to every small noise unable to stir and scarcely daring to breathe tormented by that most dreadful of all kinds of fear that fear which is the constant companion of an evil conscience,edgeworth-parents
i,edgeworth-parents
he would now have given the world to have thrown off the load of guilt which lay upon his mind,edgeworth-parents
why my jem how merry you are to day,edgeworth-parents
he said he d take him along with his own and he ll be here just now and then i know how it will be with you jem,edgeworth-parents
she came in smiling and soon made the old woman smile too by praising the neatness of everything in the house,edgeworth-parents
no it was farmer truck come for lightfoot,edgeworth-parents
my boy s a fool madam about that there horse,edgeworth-parents
said his mistress,edgeworth-parents
what s gone love,edgeworth-parents
i saw them safe last night and was showing em to lightfoot and i was so glad to think i had earned them all myself and i thought how surprised you d look and how glad you d be and how you d kiss me and all,edgeworth-parents
how came you not to give it to your mother to take care of,edgeworth-parents
oh jem,edgeworth-parents
still the lady who had lived too long in the world to be without suspicion maintained a cold manner and determined to wait the event without interfering saying only that she hoped the money would be found and advised jem to have done crying,edgeworth-parents
the old woman stood at the door and several idle people of the village who had gathered round the lady s carriage examining it turned about to listen,edgeworth-parents
at this instant a party of milk women went by and one of them having set down her pail came behind jem and gave him a pretty smart blow upon the back,edgeworth-parents
do you so,edgeworth-parents
and have you oh tell me have you got the rest of my money,edgeworth-parents
why madam said she taking up the corner of her apron i came by it in an odd way too,edgeworth-parents
i see it i know it said jem out of breath with anxiety,edgeworth-parents
the lad took no notice but when he opened it out it falls,edgeworth-parents
oh which way did they go,edgeworth-parents
out of the boot of the carriage the coachman immediately produced a new saddle and bridle,edgeworth-parents
the children especially who were fond of him expressed the strongest indignation against the thieves,edgeworth-parents
good god,edgeworth-parents
a man who was half drunk pushed his way forwards swearing that nobody should stop him that he had a right to see and he would see,edgeworth-parents
lawrence,edgeworth-parents
such a young creature so wicked,edgeworth-parents
while this was saying the farmer was emptying lazy lawrence s pockets and when the money appeared all his former companions in the village looked at each other with astonishment and terror,edgeworth-parents
he put on a bold insolent countenance till he heard lawrence s confession till the money was found upon him and he heard the milk woman declare that she would swear to the silver penny which he had dropped,edgeworth-parents
yes madam for mercy s sake said jem s mother to the lady think what a disgrace to his family to be sent to gaol,edgeworth-parents
nothing more was said for everybody felt the truth of the farmer s speech,edgeworth-parents
the false key,edgeworth-parents
but mr spencer always assured him that he might make himself whatever he pleased that by behaving well he would certainly sooner or later secure the esteem and love of all who knew him even of those who had the strongest prejudice against him on his father s account,edgeworth-parents
you are now going to leave me and to begin the world for yourself,edgeworth-parents
mrs churchill will make you a very good mistress if you behave properly and i have no doubt but you will,edgeworth-parents
he came back with the candle and with a stout heart stood by whilst the letter was sealing and when his master put it into his hand said in a cheerful voice i hope you will let me see you again sir sometimes,edgeworth-parents
the door was opened by a large red faced man in a blue coat and scarlet waistcoat to whom he felt afraid to give his message lest he should not be a servant,edgeworth-parents
he was then shown into a handsome room where he found his mistress an elderly lady,edgeworth-parents
and she received him with a cold very well ma am which plainly showed that she was not disposed to like him,edgeworth-parents
i m sure i hope so too observed mrs pomfret but i can t say for my part i ve no great notion of those low people,edgeworth-parents
to be sure ma am i know,edgeworth-parents
he would be forced to starve or steal if everybody had such prejudices,edgeworth-parents
about her nephew ma am the boy she and i was speaking to you for,edgeworth-parents
o no ma am not at all she does not think to say that else i should be very angry but the poor woman never let fall a word any more than frets that the boy should miss such a good place,edgeworth-parents
he perceived indeed for the comparisons were minutely made in audible and scornful whispers that felix was a much handsomer or as the kitchen maid expressed it a much more genteeler gentlemanly looking like sort of person than he was and he was made to understand that he wanted a frill to his shirt a cravat a pair of thin shoes and above all shoe strings besides other nameless advantages which justly made his rival the admiration of the kitchen,edgeworth-parents
he had made great progress in the affections of corkscrew the butler by working indeed very hard for him and doing every day at least half his business,edgeworth-parents
and as he had told exactly the truth and meant to do no harm he was surprised at the butler s return when he repeated to him what had passed at receiving a sudden box on the ear and the appellation of a mischievous impertinent mean spirited brat,edgeworth-parents
because you know i saw you go out,edgeworth-parents
but were you,edgeworth-parents
why are not mistress clogs cleaned,edgeworth-parents
many a handful of currants many a half custard many a triangular remnant of pie besides the choice of his own meal at breakfast dinner and supper fell to the share of the favourite felix whilst franklin was neglected though he took the utmost pains to please the cook in all honourable service and when she was hot angry or hurried he was always at hand to help her and in the hour of adversity when the clock struck five and no dinner was dished and no kitchen maid with twenty pair of hands was to be had franklin would answer to her call with flowers to garnish her dishes and presence of mind to know in the midst of the commotion where everything that was wanting was to be found so that quick as lightning all difficulties vanished before him,edgeworth-parents
mrs pomfret the housekeeper had several times directly and indirectly given the world below to understand that she and her mistress thought there was a prodigious quantity of meat eaten of late,edgeworth-parents
she spoke but no beef appeared till franklin with a look of sudden recollection cried did not i see something like a piece of beef in a basket in the dairy i think,edgeworth-parents
you thought you saw,edgeworth-parents
mrs pomfret whose eyes were blinded by her prejudices against the folks of the villaintropic society and also by her secret jealousy of a boy whom she deemed to be a growing favourite of her mistress took part with the cook and ended as she began with a firm persuasion that franklin was the guilty person,edgeworth-parents
felix too,edgeworth-parents
cunning people may go on cleverly in their devices for some time but although they may escape once twice perhaps ninety nine times what does that signify for the hundredth time they come to shame and lose all their character,edgeworth-parents
very well said she,edgeworth-parents
manchon leaped up and was not to be rebuffed,edgeworth-parents
but manchon leaped up again and began smelling near the fatal pocket in a most alarming manner,edgeworth-parents
but manchon knew better he had now got his head into felix s pocket and would not be quiet till he had drawn from thence rustling out of its brown paper half a cold turkey which had been missing since morning,edgeworth-parents
i don t know ma am answered felix so confused that he knew not what to say but,edgeworth-parents
he was struck dumb,edgeworth-parents
he knew how to bring his charge home to her,edgeworth-parents
besides she had rated felix s abilities very highly because he made up her weekly accounts for her but unluckily once when franklin was out of the way and she brought a bill in a hurry to her favourite to cast up she discovered that he did not know how to cast up pounds shillings and pence and he was obliged to confess that she must wait till franklin came home,edgeworth-parents
all these precautions taken the butler was at liberty to indulge his favourite passion which so increased with indulgence that his wages were by no means sufficient to support him in this way of life,edgeworth-parents
he had run up a long bill at the alehouse which he frequented and the landlord who grew urgent for his money refused to give further credit,edgeworth-parents
they were in high good humour and the butler soon grew so intimate with them that in the openness of his heart he soon communicated to them not only all his own affairs but all that he knew and more than all that he knew of his mistress,edgeworth-parents
upon this hint corkscrew became all attention till after some hesitation on their part and repeated promises of secrecy on his they at length disclosed their plans to him,edgeworth-parents
in the morning felix reminded him of the things which he had said and corkscrew alarmed endeavoured to evade his questions by saying that he was not in his senses when he talked in that manner,edgeworth-parents
it is said by those whose fatal experience gives them a right to be believed that a drunkard will sacrifice anything everything sooner than the pleasure of habitual intoxication,edgeworth-parents
he had left it with felix and was now obliged to explain the new difficulty which had arisen,edgeworth-parents
even this paltry temptation working upon his vanity at length prevailed with a boy whose integrity had long been corrupted by the habits of petty pilfering and daily falsehood,edgeworth-parents
franklin slept in the next room to him and presently awaking thought he perceived a strong smell of something burning,edgeworth-parents
franklin ran upstairs to awaken mrs pomfret whose terror of fire was so great that she came from her room almost out of her senses whilst he with the greatest presence of mind recollected where he had seen two large tubs of water which the maids had prepared the night before for their washing and seizing the wet linen which had been left to soak he threw them upon the flames,edgeworth-parents
if she asks me you know i must tell the truth replied he,edgeworth-parents
repeated felix,edgeworth-parents
he took up the candlestick but the moment the housekeeper cast her eye upon it she snatched it from his hands how did this candlestick come here,edgeworth-parents
oh ma am said felix indeed you forget for mr corkscrew came into my room to desire me to call him betimes in the morning and i happened to take particular notice and he had the japanned candlestick in his hand and that was just as i heard you bolting the door,edgeworth-parents
i won t please to recollect just whatever you please sir,edgeworth-parents
how do you find yourself this morning ma am,edgeworth-parents
oh dear ma am it struck before i came upstairs and you know we are twenty minutes slow lord bless us,edgeworth-parents
i m so sorry to think of disturbing you cried mrs pomfret at the same time throwing the shutters wide open but to be sure ma am i have something to tell you which won t let you sleep again in a hurry,edgeworth-parents
to be sure ma am what i say is that without the spirit of prophecy one can nowadays account for what has passed,edgeworth-parents
to be sure ma am how can i help believing him,edgeworth-parents
mrs churchill could not help smiling,edgeworth-parents
take care that you don t go from one extreme into another pomfret don t spoil the boy,edgeworth-parents
when franklin brought the urn into the breakfast parlour his mistress was standing by the fire with the key in her hand,edgeworth-parents
that is but a short time yet you have conducted yourself so as to make me think i may depend upon you,edgeworth-parents
franklin stood silent with a firm but modest look,edgeworth-parents
i will madam do anything you order me said franklin and received the key from her hands,edgeworth-parents
she had never had any idea of the real fact that he and felix were joined in a plot with house breakers to rob the house but thought he only went out at irregular hours to indulge himself in his passion for drinking,edgeworth-parents
you never went to a play did you,edgeworth-parents
and do you think mistress would let you if i asked,edgeworth-parents
delight surprise and gratitude appeared in franklin s face at these words,edgeworth-parents
answered franklin starting i m sorry but i can t do that for i ve promised my mistress never to let it out of my own hands,edgeworth-parents
cried corkscrew changing his tone then sir i can t take you to the play,edgeworth-parents
oh i should like it of all things if i did not come between anybody else,edgeworth-parents
i don t doubt that answered franklin,edgeworth-parents
mr spencer told me that was worse than robbing,edgeworth-parents
but we ll have the key from him in spite of all his obstinacy said felix and let him make his story good as he can afterwards,edgeworth-parents
probably our young readers cannot guess what use they could mean to make of this impression of the key in wax,edgeworth-parents
all these things considered franklin resolved to take the key just as it was with the wax sticking to it to his mistress,edgeworth-parents
so mr franklin said he i m glad to find you are in such high trust in this family,edgeworth-parents
yes half an hour ago sir,edgeworth-parents
why sir they can t be gone to the play,edgeworth-parents
we shall all be murdered in our beds as sure as i m a living woman sir but if you ll only take my advice,edgeworth-parents
she was silent and contented herself the rest of the evening with making signs looking ominous and stalking about the house like one possessed with a secret,edgeworth-parents
a constable and proper assistance was sent to mrs churchill s,edgeworth-parents
well ma am said mrs pomfret who had heard all the news in the morning the villains are all safe thank god,edgeworth-parents
ma am that boy has the best heart in the world,edgeworth-parents
no ma am and i m sure franklin thinks no more of reward than i do,edgeworth-parents
i am very much obliged to you indeed ma am and i ll go with him with all my heart and choose such plays as won t do no prejudice to his morality,edgeworth-parents
dryden,edgeworth-parents
he built a new house at the entrance of the village and had a large well fenced garden yet notwithstanding his fences he never felt himself secure,edgeworth-parents
indeed so careful were even the village children of giving offence to this irritable man of the law that they would not venture to fly a kite near his fields lest it should entangle in his trees or fall upon his meadow,edgeworth-parents
she was vexed to observe that her absence was not regretted and she was mortified to perceive that she could not humble them by any display of airs and finery,edgeworth-parents
susan had been taught to work neatly by her good mother who was very fond of her and to whom she was most gratefully attached,edgeworth-parents
it was now time to choose the queen,edgeworth-parents
were the first unwelcome words which she overheard,edgeworth-parents
and i wish susan would come i m sure cried a little girl whose lap was full of primroses,edgeworth-parents
she must make up the garlands and she shall be queen of the may,edgeworth-parents
the little electors thought that all business should give way to theirs and rose was dispatched to summon her friend immediately,edgeworth-parents
i wish he and his daughter bab or miss barbara as she must now be called were a hundred miles off out of our way i know,edgeworth-parents
rich or poor said philip it does not become a girl to look conceited much less bold as barbara did the other day when she was at her father s door without a hat upon her head staring at the strange gentleman who stopped hereabout to let his horse drink,edgeworth-parents
his supper was ready for him nearly an hour before he came home and susan swept up the ashes twice and twice put on wood to make a cheerful blaze for him but at last when he did come in he took no notice of the blaze or of susan and when his wife asked him how he did he made no answer but stood with his back to the fire looking very gloomy,edgeworth-parents
susan hung up his hat put his coat over the back of a chair to dry and then stood anxiously looking at her mother who was not well she had this day fatigued herself with baking and now alarmed by her husband s moody behaviour she sat down pale and trembling,edgeworth-parents
she thanked him and with that nimble alacrity which marks the desire to please she ran to her neat chicken yard but alas her guinea hen was not there it had strayed into the attorney s garden,edgeworth-parents
oh my guinea hen,edgeworth-parents
now pay damages queen susan or good bye to your pretty guinea hen said barbara in an insulting tone,edgeworth-parents
oh if sixpence would do,edgeworth-parents
what s your father or his supper to us,edgeworth-parents
susan retired disconsolate,edgeworth-parents
but what is the matter,edgeworth-parents
never mind me i can t come i can t stay for my father wants me,edgeworth-parents
ay like father like daughter cried farmer price starting from the thoughtful attitude in which he had been fixed and drawing his chair closer to his wife,edgeworth-parents
but the truth is the truth and it is what i think fittest to be spoken at all times come what will of it,edgeworth-parents
i m not come to the worst part of my story yet,edgeworth-parents
susan love open the window,edgeworth-parents
case met farmer price as he was coming home whistling from a new ploughed field,edgeworth-parents
accosting the farmer in a haughty manner the attorney began with so farmer price a word with you if you please,edgeworth-parents
said the farmer,edgeworth-parents
my good friend mr price said he in a soft voice and pale with suppressed rage,edgeworth-parents
no said the farmer not a guinea of it but john simpson who was my substitute has not left our village yet,edgeworth-parents
i,edgeworth-parents
then why so stiff about it price,edgeworth-parents
truth is truth and must be spoken justice is justice and should be done mr,edgeworth-parents
as he drew nearer home many melancholy thoughts pressed upon his heart,edgeworth-parents
we ll give you a taste of the law my good sir or i m mistaken,edgeworth-parents
pardon me said the attorney locking his desk and putting the key into his pocket possession my honest friend cried he striking his hand upon the desk is nine points of the law,edgeworth-parents
price retired with melancholy feelings but not intimidated,edgeworth-parents
the rushlight which stood beside the bed was now burnt low the long shadow of the tall wicker chair flitted faded appeared and vanished as the flame rose and sunk in the socket,edgeworth-parents
as it approached nearer she knew that it was philip playing upon his pipe and tabor,edgeworth-parents
here s the queen of the may,edgeworth-parents
then gently putting aside the crown her companions bid her say who should wear it for her,edgeworth-parents
i shall stop for all day said philip i ve no mind to play any more,edgeworth-parents
how grateful that child is to me for a cowslip only,edgeworth-parents
her mother when she awakened felt much refreshed by her tranquil sleep and observing that it was a delightful morning said that she had been dreaming she heard music but that the drum frightened her because she thought it was the signal for her husband to be carried away by a whole regiment of soldiers who had pointed their bayonets at him,edgeworth-parents
but he ll want he ll want a hundred things said she starting up,edgeworth-parents
and indeed her mother was ill able to bear any hurry or to do any work this day,edgeworth-parents
she went out,edgeworth-parents
this is the money that has been given to us in the village this may morning,edgeworth-parents
rose hurried away pleased with her commission and to accomplish her business,edgeworth-parents
said she to her maid but as soon as she saw rose behind the maid she put on a scornful air,edgeworth-parents
she assured her that the person from whom she came did not send her either to beg or borrow that she was able to pay the full value of that for which she came to ask and producing her well filled purse i believe that this is a very good shilling said she,edgeworth-parents
i would have taken a shilling yesterday if it had been paid at the time properly but i told susan that if it was not paid then i should keep the hen and so i shall i promise her,edgeworth-parents
the shillings sounded provoking upon the table as she threw them down one after another and barbara coolly replied three won t do,edgeworth-parents
rose went on rapidly bidding shilling after shilling till she had completely emptied her purse,edgeworth-parents
they all went to susan in a body and told her so,edgeworth-parents
susan was touched but not astonished by the kindness of her young friends and she received the purse with as much simplicity as she would have given it,edgeworth-parents
now susan had heard her mother often in the course of this day wish that she had but money enough in the world to pay john simpson for going to serve in the militia instead of her husband,edgeworth-parents
i would not be her for all the guinea hens or guineas either in the whole world,edgeworth-parents
susan assured her friend that she did not doubt the powers of her needle and that she would most willingly accept of her services but that unluckily she had finished all the needle work immediately wanted,edgeworth-parents
she was not now strong enough to attempt another herself and when the brewer s boy came with eagerness to tell her that he had some fine fresh yeast she thanked him but sighed and said it would be of no use to her,edgeworth-parents
she is the most industrious little creature ma am in the world said she to her mistress,edgeworth-parents
she had it is true been very busy but orderly people can be busy and neat at the same time,edgeworth-parents
they were judiciously generous and whilst they wished to diffuse happiness they were not peremptory in requiring that people should be happy precisely their own way,edgeworth-parents
it was impossible that such a grand event as susan s visit to the abbey could long remain unknown to barbara case and her gossiping maid,edgeworth-parents
so susan said bab who came close up to her before she perceived it how goes the world with you to day,edgeworth-parents
one may see you ve been in good company this morning hey susan,edgeworth-parents
continued bab,edgeworth-parents
betty i must hear about it,edgeworth-parents
my papa may well call her simple susan for simple she is and simple she will be all the world over,edgeworth-parents
barbara followed susan into the cottage and found her occupied with the grand affair of the broth,edgeworth-parents
will you please to sit down then miss said simple susan with a smile for at this instant she forgot the guinea hen i have but just put the parsley into the broth but it soon will be ready,edgeworth-parents
ay that s as plain as a pike staff said barbara but what else did she mean think you,edgeworth-parents
how nice that broth does look resumed barbara after a pause,edgeworth-parents
won t you take a spoon,edgeworth-parents
the next time i set my foot in this house you shall be as saucy to me as you please,edgeworth-parents
the saying become proverbial in the village,edgeworth-parents
la miss said barbara s maid when she found her mistress in a passion upon her return from susan s i only wondered you did her the honour to set your foot within her doors,edgeworth-parents
she ran into her father s parlour but she knew the moment she saw his face that it was no time to ask questions his pen was across his mouth and his brown wig pushed oblique upon his contracted forehead,edgeworth-parents
he had sound reasons for his doubts,edgeworth-parents
in short he had not yet decided whether he was an honest man or a knave,edgeworth-parents
i am come said sir arthur to enjoy that kind of domestic life in the country which i prefer to all others and amongst people whose happiness i hope to increase,edgeworth-parents
sir arthur looked disappointed and the keen attorney seized the moment to inform him that price s whole land was at his disposal,edgeworth-parents
you are mistaken my good sir and you are not mistaken said mr case with a shrewd smile,edgeworth-parents
the attorney observed that at these words sir arthur s eye was fixed with a look of earnest attention,edgeworth-parents
sure,edgeworth-parents
it was sir said he a lease for the life of peter price susanna his wife and to the survivor or survivors of them or for the full time and term of twenty years to be computed from the first day of may then next ensuing,edgeworth-parents
my dear sir said the attorney taking him by the button you have no scruple of stirring in this business,edgeworth-parents
i make all safe to you with my bond,edgeworth-parents
there s only one thing we have forgotten all this time said sir arthur,edgeworth-parents
he softened and said he should have had certainly more consideration in the case of any but a litigious pig headed fellow as he knew price to be,edgeworth-parents
whom shall i apply to,edgeworth-parents
he had often found that small timely presents worked wonderfully upon his own mind and he judged of others by himself,edgeworth-parents
i know of one cried barbara,edgeworth-parents
he found susan packing up her father s little wardrobe and when she looked up as she knelt he saw that she had been in tears,edgeworth-parents
that s a pity,edgeworth-parents
cried she looking up at him and a sudden ray of hope beamed in her ingenuous countenance,edgeworth-parents
she started up in an ecstasy,edgeworth-parents
said susan but what can that do,edgeworth-parents
is your lamb better than anybody else s think you,edgeworth-parents
stay oh stay,edgeworth-parents
where is it,edgeworth-parents
as soon however as her persecutor turned his back and quitted the house susan sat down and hid her face in her hands,edgeworth-parents
something s amiss susan said her mother raising herself as well as she was able in the bed to examine her daughter s countenance,edgeworth-parents
are you sure he will stay,edgeworth-parents
attorney case told me so he can get him a week s longer leave of absence and he has promised he will,edgeworth-parents
she could not say amen,edgeworth-parents
she then resolved to make out all the bills for the neighbours who had many of them taken a few loaves and rolls of her baking,edgeworth-parents
the table was covered with little square bits of paper on which she had been writing bills over and over again when her father came in with a bill in his hand,edgeworth-parents
here look at the bill you were sending up to the abbey,edgeworth-parents
what are all these child,edgeworth-parents
she corrected all the mistakes with so much patience and bore to be blamed with so much good humour that her father at last said that it was impossible ever to scold susan without being in the wrong at the last,edgeworth-parents
said she to herself but i know he will be a little sorry too for my poor lamb,edgeworth-parents
cowper,edgeworth-parents
susan had once been under her gentle dominion and had been deservedly her favourite scholar,edgeworth-parents
the voices were still raised one above another all eager to establish some important observation about ninepins or marbles or tops or bows and arrows when suddenly music was heard and the crowd was silenced,edgeworth-parents
what a pity,edgeworth-parents
he seemed pleased by their simple exclamations of wonder and delight and eager to amuse his young audience he played now a gay and now a pathetic air to suit their several humours,edgeworth-parents
cried susan s little brother william who had stationed himself between the old man s knees,edgeworth-parents
and good tempered,edgeworth-parents
quite right,edgeworth-parents
though i am blind said the harper i can hear you know and i heard from your sister herself all that i told you of her that she was good tempered and good natured and fond of you,edgeworth-parents
oh interrupted william it s all true but how did you find out that she was fond of me,edgeworth-parents
well play us a tune if you can play ever a good one play me let s see what shall he play bob,edgeworth-parents
this boy was the son of attorney case and as his father had neglected to correct his temper when he was a child as he grew up it became insufferable,edgeworth-parents
at last he put his hand surlily into his waistcoat pocket and pulled out a shilling,edgeworth-parents
i am afraid then you ll get no other said young case with an insulting laugh,edgeworth-parents
you may pass it you know as well as i do if you look sharp,edgeworth-parents
cried the tyrant sternly looking down upon his judges,edgeworth-parents
he was a sickly looking boy and of a remarkably peaceful disposition,edgeworth-parents
the shilling was handed to susan who though she had with becoming modesty forborne all interference did not hesitate when she was called upon to speak the truth i think that this shilling is a bad one said she and the gentle but firm tone in which she pronounced the words for a moment awed and silenced the angry and brutal boy,edgeworth-parents
i ll lead him i can lead him said he and john ran on before them to gather king cups in the meadow,edgeworth-parents
good bye,edgeworth-parents
come in susan we thought you had quite forsaken us said miss somers to susan who advanced timidly,edgeworth-parents
because as how continued john she was loth to refuse us the hearing a blind man play on the harp,edgeworth-parents
i fancy we shall find what we want here said miss somers stopping before a shop where unfolded sheets of pins and glass buttons glistened in the window and where rolls of many coloured ribbons appeared ranged in tempting order,edgeworth-parents
susan looked on with more indifference than most of the spectators,edgeworth-parents
she does not like any of these things whispered miss somers to her sister,edgeworth-parents
said miss somers,edgeworth-parents
from what we know and from what we have heard of you we are persuaded that you will make a good use of it,edgeworth-parents
when you come to our cottage again you shall know all,edgeworth-parents
she was to have been queen of the may which in our little village amongst the younger tribe is a thing that is thought of a good deal but susan s mother was ill and susan after sitting up with her all night would not leave her in the morning even when they brought the crown to her,edgeworth-parents
you will i hope find us good customers and well wishers added she with a smile for those who wish well to their neighbours surely deserve to have well wishers themselves,edgeworth-parents
besides this treasure she calculated that the amount of the bills for bread could not be less than eight or nine and thirty shillings and as her father was now sure of a week s reprieve she had great hopes that by some means or other it would be possible to make up the whole sum necessary to pay for a substitute,edgeworth-parents
susan took the path that led to the meadow by the waterside resolved to go by herself and take leave of her innocent favourite,edgeworth-parents
susan saw her lamb by the water side,edgeworth-parents
the butcher was feeling whether the lamb was fat,edgeworth-parents
that s the butcher s business,edgeworth-parents
the butcher looked aside and hastily rubbed his eyes with the corner of his blue apron,edgeworth-parents
and he walked off deaf to the prayers of the poor children,edgeworth-parents
susan thanked him but walked away quickly without looking again at her lamb,edgeworth-parents
i was thinking about it boy myself said the butcher it s a sin to kill a pet lamb i m thinking any way it s what i m not used to and don t fancy doing and i ll go and say as much to attorney case but he s a hard man there s but one way to deal with him and that s the way i must take though so be i shall be the loser thereby but we ll say nothing to the boys for fear it might be the thing would not take and then it would be worse again to poor susan who is a good girl and always was as well as she may being of a good breed and well reared from the first,edgeworth-parents
the butcher had choice tender lamb he said fit to eat the next day and as mr case was impatient to make his offering to sir arthur he accepted the butcher s proposal though with such seeming reluctance that he actually squeezed out of him before he would complete the bargain a bribe of a fine sweetbread,edgeworth-parents
if here is not our old man,edgeworth-parents
my boy has got a bed for himself here in the village but i have no place,edgeworth-parents
many roofs that are twice as high are not half so good said he,edgeworth-parents
who knows dearest mother but we may keep him with us for ever,edgeworth-parents
he was surprised at the sight of the twelve shillings and still more when he came to the bottom of the purse to see the bright golden guinea,edgeworth-parents
oh no no said her father i have her first baking snug here besides in my pocket,edgeworth-parents
why continued he turning to the harper i ask your pardon for speaking out so free before strangers in praise of my own which i know is not mannerly but the truth is the fittest thing to be spoken as i think at all times therefore here s your good health susan why by and by she ll be worth her weight in gold in silver at least,edgeworth-parents
susan did not much like to tell the history of her guinea hen of the gown and of her poor lamb,edgeworth-parents
he then asked for his harp and after tuning it for a considerable time he recollected for he had often fits of absence that he sent for it to play the tune he had promised to the boys,edgeworth-parents
often had she sighed to be there and often had she revolved in her mind schemes for introducing herself to some genteel neighbours who might take her to the ball in their carriage,edgeworth-parents
to be sure said the maid it s the least one may expect from a lady who demeans herself to visit susan price and goes about a shopping for her,edgeworth-parents
i can see you know something of the fashions to morrow at the abbey,edgeworth-parents
she expected to see wonders,edgeworth-parents
miss barbara case with her mistaken airs of gentility aiming to be thought a woman and a fine lady whilst she was in reality a child and a vulgar attorney s daughter rendered herself so thoroughly ridiculous that the good natured yet discerning spectators were painfully divided between their sense of comic absurdity and a feeling of shame for one who could feel nothing for herself,edgeworth-parents
they can never enjoy the present moment,edgeworth-parents
she made no answer in expectation that the housekeeper who was a woman of a very open temper would explain her cause of dissatisfaction,edgeworth-parents
if my boy philip was at home maybe as he s often at mrs price s which i don t disapprove he might know the history of the guinea hen,edgeworth-parents
attorney case expected to smell mint sauce and as the covers were taken from off the dishes looked around for lamb but no lamb appeared,edgeworth-parents
he never saw a man carve better than the gentleman opposite him who was the curate of the parish,edgeworth-parents
if we were to accept a lamb from a rich neighbour on my estate said he i am afraid we should mortify many of our poor tenants who can have little to offer though perhaps they may bear us thorough good will notwithstanding,edgeworth-parents
barbara fixed her eyes upon miss somers as she spoke but she could not read her countenance as distinctly as she wished because miss somers was at this moment letting down the veil of her hat,edgeworth-parents
it was much admired,edgeworth-parents
he thanked her but in the midst of his bow of thanks his eye was struck by the sight of the guinea hen and he involuntarily exclaimed susan s guinea hen i declare,edgeworth-parents
why ma am said he may i speak out,edgeworth-parents
i wish susan had kept it at home as she should have done,edgeworth-parents
if you please ma am said barbara sullenly i have nothing more to do with it,edgeworth-parents
he ran into the village,edgeworth-parents
stop one minute,edgeworth-parents
it is daisy,edgeworth-parents
and there was a universal shout of joy,edgeworth-parents
daisy however has been as well off in my paddock as he would have been in the field by the waterside,edgeworth-parents
she saw the crowd of children coming nearer and nearer,edgeworth-parents
come on,edgeworth-parents
it was for my father and mother,edgeworth-parents
this was the voice of attorney case who was returning with his daughter barbara from his visit to the abbey,edgeworth-parents
yes said philip she ll not forget may day in a hurry,edgeworth-parents
no,edgeworth-parents
perhaps some time or other i may be able to earn,edgeworth-parents
then he stayed a little longer to let her into the history of the guinea hen and to tell her who it was that brought the hen home from the abbey,edgeworth-parents
when this operation was successfully performed which it certainly could never have been if philip had not held the hen for susan he recollected that his mother had sent him with a message to mrs price,edgeworth-parents
philip departed and as he went out of the garden wicket he looked up and saw bab and her maid betty staring out of the window as usual,edgeworth-parents
well said she to her confidante betty you hear how things have turned out but if miss somers won t think of asking me to go out with her i ve a notion i know who will,edgeworth-parents
it was with this lady that miss barbara now hoped to go to the harpers ball,edgeworth-parents
i heard her say so myself,edgeworth-parents
said bab laughing,edgeworth-parents
in the morning betty went with miss barbara s compliments to susan to beg some honey for mrs strathspey who could not breakfast without it,edgeworth-parents
susan said she accosting the poor girl whom she had done everything in her power to injure i must beg a little more honey from you for mrs strathspey s breakfast,edgeworth-parents
barbara grew angry and lost all command of herself when she saw that susan without regarding her reproaches went on looking through the glass pane in the beehive,edgeworth-parents
will you give me that piece of the honey comb that lies there,edgeworth-parents
bab grasped but at her first effort she only reached the rosemary,edgeworth-parents
if you stand quietly you won t be stung perhaps,edgeworth-parents
i shall be turned away for it you ll see,edgeworth-parents
no that you can t expect to do indeed said betty the comforter,edgeworth-parents
mr case began to fear that he had mistaken his game in quarrelling with this family,edgeworth-parents
said he,edgeworth-parents
betty instantly began to tell the story of barbara s mishap her own way,edgeworth-parents
susan now interceded for barbara and the attorney softening his voice said that susan was a great deal too good to her as you are indeed added he to everybody,edgeworth-parents
the farmer was a blunt honest man and his countenance remained inflexibly contemptuous when the attorney addressed him in his softest tone,edgeworth-parents
the harpers who contended for the prize were placed under the music gallery at the lower end of the room,edgeworth-parents
there was now silence,edgeworth-parents
the silence was followed by a universal buzz of applause,edgeworth-parents
miss somers looked at her brother from time to time as she wrote and sir arthur as soon as the old man had finished took him aside and asked him some questions which brought the whole history of susan s lamb and of attorney case s cruelty to light,edgeworth-parents
the boy ran with the letter to the post office,edgeworth-parents
who can think of writing to me in this world,edgeworth-parents
but it is not april it is may father said susan,edgeworth-parents
your hospitality to me has afforded to me an opportunity of learning some of your family history,edgeworth-parents
if it is never convenient to you to pay it i shall never ask it,edgeworth-parents
i see more of the world under my tattered garb than perhaps i should ever see in a better dress,edgeworth-parents
her mother leaned over her shoulder to read the words but they were interrupted before they had finished the first stanza by another knock at the door,edgeworth-parents
mr price will you come out with me and let me show you a piece of your land through which i want to make a road,edgeworth-parents
you are welcome to it and i leave it to you to find me out another bit of land convenient to me that will be worth neither more nor less or else to make up the value to me some way or other,edgeworth-parents
now by reason a man does not make a mistake on purpose it seems to me to be the fair thing that if a man finds out his mistake he might set it right but attorney case says this is not law and i ve no more to say,edgeworth-parents
i ve no more to say,edgeworth-parents
sir i was the more loath to see it shut into his garden which moreover is large enough of all conscience without it because you must know sir arthur the children in our village are fond of making a little play green of it and they have a custom of meeting on may day at a hawthorn that stands in the middle of it and altogether i was very loath to see em turned out of it by those who have no right,edgeworth-parents
explanations were things of which he had a great dread but fortunately he was upon this occasion a little too late,edgeworth-parents
let it belong to whom it will i give it up to you,edgeworth-parents
then said sir arthur mr price you will observe that i now promise this little green to the children for a play ground and i hope they may gather hawthorn many a may day at this their favourite bush,edgeworth-parents
you have done him no injury said sir arthur coolly,edgeworth-parents
said sir arthur,edgeworth-parents
a fatal error,edgeworth-parents
but you won t take advantage of me surely sir arthur,edgeworth-parents
i am ready at a fair valuation to pay the exact value of your house and land but upon this condition that you quit the parish within one month,edgeworth-parents
said sir arthur to mr price as they walked home towards the cottage,edgeworth-parents
you are very good very good indeed sir to speak in this sort of way said the delighted father,edgeworth-parents
i hope sir said price with joy and gratitude glowing in his honest countenance that you ll never have cause to repent your goodness,edgeworth-parents
i have just prevailed upon her mother to tell me what became of it,edgeworth-parents
joy i think has made me quite well,edgeworth-parents
these ladies look as if they would not refuse you anything that is reasonable and i think you look as if you would not ask anything unreasonable,edgeworth-parents
say no more said miss somers your wish is granted,edgeworth-parents
fare ye well,edgeworth-parents
i long so i do to see him in this house again drinking as he did just in this spot a glass of susan s mead to her very good health,edgeworth-parents
rose ran away with it mother but i ll step after her and bring it back to you this minute said susan,edgeworth-parents
many came out of their houses to have the pleasure of hearing the joyful tidings confirmed by susan herself,edgeworth-parents
the white pigeon,edgeworth-parents
amongst these was mr cox an alehouse keeper who did not bear a very good character,edgeworth-parents
and please your honour but i don t know what it is i or mine have done to offend you,edgeworth-parents
no man has belied you mr cox but your nose belies you much if you do not love drinking a little and your black eye and cut chin belie you much if you do not love quarrelling a little,edgeworth-parents
here mr cox put himself into a boxing attitude but observing that mr somerville looked at his threatening gesture with a smile and that several people who had gathered round him as he stood in the street laughed at the proof he gave of his peaceable disposition he changed his attitude and went on to vindicate himself against the charge of drinking,edgeworth-parents
impossible,edgeworth-parents
then your honour won t let me have it,edgeworth-parents
ha,edgeworth-parents
so i think he knows nothing of the matter,edgeworth-parents
he went from room to room with great expressions of admiration and delight,edgeworth-parents
o stay,edgeworth-parents
i am persuaded by your open honest countenance that you are speaking the truth but pray explain this matter to us for you have not made it quite clear,edgeworth-parents
upon this piece of waste ground the children of the village often used to play,edgeworth-parents
yes said the carpenter and in the bow window room below there s plenty of his feathers to be seen for i ve just been down to look,edgeworth-parents
i forgive him all the mischief he has done me tell your friend for your sake,edgeworth-parents
more happy for him to have such a father and mother exclaimed the boy,edgeworth-parents
they are but just come into the town please your honour said the carpenter,edgeworth-parents
he writes a good hand and is quick at casting up accounts for his age,edgeworth-parents
you have saved its life said the woman to whom it belonged and i ll make you a present of it,edgeworth-parents
so brian i see your schooling has not been thrown away upon you you like your book i see when you have no master over you to bid you read said his father when he came in and saw brian reading his book very attentively,edgeworth-parents
if other pigeons have done so before him i think he is as good and i daresay will be as easy to teach as any pigeon in the world,edgeworth-parents
the pigeon will be home long before me father and he will come in at the kitchen window and light upon the dresser then you must untie the little note which i shall have tied under his left wing and you ll know the price of beef directly,edgeworth-parents
whilst these men were talking over their scheme one of them observed that one of their companions was not arrived,edgeworth-parents
accordingly the next day young cox went to brian o neill and tried at first by persuasion and afterwards by threats to prevail upon him to give up the pigeon,edgeworth-parents
but this was false for it was he who during the night time had stolen the white pigeon,edgeworth-parents
the pigeon however had a better memory than they imagined,edgeworth-parents
at this instant the pigeon spread his wings and brian discovered under one of its wings a small and very dirty looking billet,edgeworth-parents
mr summervill is to lye out to nite kip the pigeon untill to morrow,edgeworth-parents
mr somerville in consequence of this fortunate discovery took proper measures for the apprehension of the eight men who had sworn to rob his house,edgeworth-parents
we thank you sir but we ll not take the money i don t like to take the price of blood,edgeworth-parents
o and welcome sir said the boy with a smile and he brought the pigeon to mr somerville when it was dark and nobody saw him,edgeworth-parents
said mr somerville to brian and pull that sign straight for it hangs quite crooked,edgeworth-parents
come down from the ladder and wish your father joy of being master of the new inn called the white pigeon,edgeworth-parents
no my dear what,edgeworth-parents
don t you recollect now,edgeworth-parents
indeed,edgeworth-parents
and can bell eat more upon her birthday than upon any other day,edgeworth-parents
or the new playthings or the nice mince pies,edgeworth-parents
do you like them only because they are new,edgeworth-parents
i want you to judge very much because i am sure i was in the right,edgeworth-parents
her sister laura went with them,edgeworth-parents
you know my godmother when she gave it to you said you would keep it longer than i should keep mine and i know what she thought by her look at the time,edgeworth-parents
and she ll see that she was not mistaken,edgeworth-parents
now it happened that the shop was the corner house of a street and one of the windows looked out into a narrow lane,edgeworth-parents
said laura and very honest too,edgeworth-parents
the little girl came back out of breath to her work but what was her surprise and sorrow to find it spoiled,edgeworth-parents
can t you,edgeworth-parents
at this instant her mother said to rosamond come now my dear if you want this filigree paper buy it,edgeworth-parents
in the meantime she that was called the little miser beckoned to the poor girl and opening the window said pointing to the cushion is it quite spoiled,edgeworth-parents
how much would another cost,edgeworth-parents
oh no,edgeworth-parents
it will never do my dear said her father who had been watching her operations,edgeworth-parents
father,edgeworth-parents
but what is the use of the poor handle said her father if we are not to take hold of it,edgeworth-parents
you think then that i have wasted my time because the basket is of no use but then it is a present for my cousin bell,edgeworth-parents
but bell will like the basket i know though it is of no use,edgeworth-parents
well but i don t think i am at all fond of her,edgeworth-parents
then your reason for giving is because she expects you to give her something,edgeworth-parents
so do i full as well as your godmother but we have not yet quite settled what it is to be generous,edgeworth-parents
rosamond looked down upon the basket and was silent,edgeworth-parents
if you have sense enough to see your own mistakes and can afterwards avoid them you will never be a fool,edgeworth-parents
on her birthday she expected however to be perfectly happy,edgeworth-parents
mamma said it should,edgeworth-parents
the lace however could not be had and bell at length submitted to let the frock be put on,edgeworth-parents
no but if i am asked,edgeworth-parents
till after dinner,edgeworth-parents
become of you indeed,edgeworth-parents
no no i won t indeed said bell but she had learned from her maid a total disregard of truth,edgeworth-parents
we hope that both children and parents will here pause for a moment to reflect,edgeworth-parents
i have brought home the lace madam that was bespoke for the young lady,edgeworth-parents
the little girl gave the lace without reply and the maid desired her to go about her business and not to expect to be paid for that her mistress could not see anybody because she was in a room full of company,edgeworth-parents
i wish mistress would buy her lace at the warehouse as i told her and not of these folks,edgeworth-parents
the little girl departed with a cheerful countenance and bell teazed her maid till she got her to sew the long wished for lace upon her cuffs,edgeworth-parents
but you can t get any if she would for this was made on purpose for me on my birthday and nobody can get a bit more anywhere if they would give the world for it,edgeworth-parents
mamma won t let her if i ask her not,edgeworth-parents
it is pretty for all that and it cost a great deal of money too and nobody shall have any like it if they cried their eyes out,edgeworth-parents
oh,edgeworth-parents
but it is beautiful retorted her mother i chose the pattern myself,edgeworth-parents
don t point said her mother putting down her stubborn finger nor say them like nancy i am sure you misunderstood,edgeworth-parents
no defence or explanation however was to be heard for everybody had now gathered round bell to dry her tears and to comfort her for the mischief she had done to her own cuffs,edgeworth-parents
well this is a charming present indeed,edgeworth-parents
all eyes were fixed upon the wreck,edgeworth-parents
she affected much surprise when she saw what had befallen the basket and declared that she knew nothing of the matter but that she had seen her mistress in the morning put it quite safe into the wardrobe and that for her part she had never touched it or thought of touching it in her born days,edgeworth-parents
afraid of,edgeworth-parents
nancy,edgeworth-parents
don t said the maid,edgeworth-parents
i assure you i am very angry about it rosamond,edgeworth-parents
who,edgeworth-parents
i m sure she must have been meddling with it added the maid,edgeworth-parents
call her in said the lady of the house let us see her directly,edgeworth-parents
whispered rosamond to her sister,edgeworth-parents
said bell s mother i am waiting to see how long you will have the assurance to stand there with that innocent look,edgeworth-parents
you had better confess it at once and mistress perhaps will say no more about it,edgeworth-parents
and pray how came you to see it,edgeworth-parents
the maid frightened pulled the little girl by the sleeve,edgeworth-parents
ma am hesitating miss pulled and by accident i believe i saw ma am miss you know what i saw,edgeworth-parents
and am i to be put to shame on my birthday,edgeworth-parents
o fie,edgeworth-parents
you know i prophesied that your half guinea would be gone the soonest,edgeworth-parents
laura came forward,edgeworth-parents
oh that s the young lady,edgeworth-parents
i ll tell you madam if you please said the little girl,edgeworth-parents
i m sure that s better than wasting half a guinea upon a filigree basket is it not ma am,edgeworth-parents
the thing i like the best of all others father said rosamond half pleased half vexed,edgeworth-parents
eton montem,edgeworth-parents
at eleven o clock the youths being assembled in their habiliments at the college the royal family set off from the castle to see them and after walking round the courtyard they proceeded to salt hill in the following order,edgeworth-parents
among the former lady lade was foremost in the throng only two others dared venture their persons on horseback in such a multitude,edgeworth-parents
after the young gentlemen walked round the carriage ensign vince and the salt bearers proceeded to the summit of the hill but the wind being boisterous he could not exhibit his dexterity in displaying his flag and the space being too small before the carriages from the concourse of spectators the king kindly acquiesced in not having it displayed under such inconvenience,edgeworth-parents
the stadtholder the duke of gordon lord and lady melbourne viscount brome and a numerous train of fashionable nobility were present,edgeworth-parents
mr bradith colonel,edgeworth-parents
mr keity yellow and black velvet helmet trimmed with silver,edgeworth-parents
mr tomkins violet and silver helmet,edgeworth-parents

young noblemen at oxford wear yellow tufts at the tops of their caps,edgeworth-parents
aside to bursal,edgeworth-parents
i can t for the soul of me bring myself to say that bursal s not purse proud and you can,edgeworth-parents
ha,edgeworth-parents
he a choice electioneerer as you say,edgeworth-parents
there was a time my lord to save trouble and a long explanation there was a time when you liked talbots better than spaniels you understand me,edgeworth-parents
see with your own eyes and hear with your own ears and then you ll find me still what i ve been these seven years not your understrapper your hanger on your flatterer but your friend,edgeworth-parents
you are a strange fellow talbot i thought i never could have forgiven you for what you said last night,edgeworth-parents
but whatever it was i m sure it was well meant and i believe it was well said,edgeworth-parents
lord,edgeworth-parents
i m fumbling for oh here it is,edgeworth-parents
it is all i can do to forgive this,edgeworth-parents
oh hang it,edgeworth-parents
say seven fifty seven i mean for i ll lay you a wager you ve forget me and that s a shame for you too for out of the whole posse comitatus entirely now you have not a stauncher friend than poor little rory o ryan,edgeworth-parents

i forgot i was nigh letting the cat out o the bag again,edgeworth-parents
faith and that s very kind of you and if you had always done so you would never have been offended with me my lord,edgeworth-parents
lord j,edgeworth-parents
i don t like to be making disagreeable retrospects if i could any way avoid it nor to be going about the bush especially at this time o day when as mr finsbury s come we ve not so much time to lose as we had,edgeworth-parents
in a huff ay now there it is well when a man s mad to be sure he s mad and that s all that can be said about it,edgeworth-parents
rory holding him,edgeworth-parents
lord j,edgeworth-parents
agh,edgeworth-parents
so my lord to put an end to whatever of the kind you may have felt against poor talbot i ll assure you he s as innocent o that unfortunate song as the babe unborn,edgeworth-parents
not he faith he d send me to coventry or maybe to a worse place did he but know i was condescending to make this bit of explanation unknown to him,edgeworth-parents
but you told me this morning that it was he who wrote it,edgeworth-parents
walking about as if agitated,edgeworth-parents
not a word or syllable good or bad,edgeworth-parents
not if you ll give me leave to speak to your friends in your name,edgeworth-parents
exit rory,edgeworth-parents
well i shall suffer for it more than anybody else for i love talbot since he did not make the song of which i hate to think,edgeworth-parents
i give you infinite credit mr wheeler for this dress,edgeworth-parents
fins,edgeworth-parents

this is the name of a country dance,edgeworth-parents
wheel,edgeworth-parents
you don t wait for me mr finsbury,edgeworth-parents
burs,edgeworth-parents
fins,edgeworth-parents
indubitably sir but the misfortune is he,edgeworth-parents
exit finsbury,edgeworth-parents
if i m not mistaken here comes talbot to answer for himself,edgeworth-parents
come in along with us farmer hearty come in,edgeworth-parents
rory,edgeworth-parents
interrupting,edgeworth-parents
faith now the more short winded a story the better to my fancy,edgeworth-parents
the matter is young gentlemen that there was once upon a time a fine bay hunter,edgeworth-parents
i ll pay for the corn i spoiled,edgeworth-parents
the short of it is young gentlemen this un here in the fine thing em bobs pointing to wheeler is a shabby fellow he went and spoiled master newington s best hunter,edgeworth-parents
rory,edgeworth-parents
holding his sides,edgeworth-parents
omnes,edgeworth-parents
so mr talbot here who is another sort of a gentleman though he has not so fine a coat would not see a man at a loss that could not afford it and not knowing which of em it was that spoiled the horse goes when he finds the other would not pay a farthing and pays all,edgeworth-parents
lord j pray mr o ryan let the farmer go on he has more to say,edgeworth-parents
yet he let another pay there s the shabbiness,edgeworth-parents
aside,edgeworth-parents
several voices join the chorus,edgeworth-parents
rory,edgeworth-parents
talbot for ever huzza,edgeworth-parents
forgive me for my hastiness this morning,edgeworth-parents
lord j i must not say huzza for talbot,edgeworth-parents
violetta looking at a paper which louisa holds,edgeworth-parents
louisa i wish you would let me show it to mamma,edgeworth-parents
louisa,edgeworth-parents
if you please my dear,edgeworth-parents
violet,edgeworth-parents
aloud,edgeworth-parents
she who is she,edgeworth-parents
miss talbot is only playing with you,edgeworth-parents
violet,edgeworth-parents
aside to her mother,edgeworth-parents
lady p the bombay castle,edgeworth-parents
here violetta interrupts to ask her mother for her nosegay lady p gives it to her then goes on speaking,edgeworth-parents
however i found he comforted himself afterwards with a bottle of burgundy but poor miss bursal has been in hysterics ever since,edgeworth-parents
aside,edgeworth-parents
lady p it is to be hoped that the loss may at least check the foolish pride and extravagance of young bursal who as my son tells me,edgeworth-parents
lord j,edgeworth-parents
louisa,edgeworth-parents
huzza,edgeworth-parents
enter rory o ryan and another eton lad carrying talbot in a chair followed by a crowd of eton lads,edgeworth-parents
talbot and truth for ever,edgeworth-parents
there s my sister,edgeworth-parents
give him t other huzza,edgeworth-parents
curtain falls,edgeworth-parents
at length when all the other people who were in the shop had got what they wanted the shopman turned to maurice and what do you want my patient little fellow,edgeworth-parents
where is it,edgeworth-parents
then stir about it,edgeworth-parents
he can wait and i cannot wind and tide wait for no man,edgeworth-parents
well i m glad of it replied the rough faced man who was the captain of a ship,edgeworth-parents
he immediately caught hold of the captain s leg and stopped him,edgeworth-parents
i am really very much obliged to you my little fellow said he,edgeworth-parents
be so kind continued he turning to the shopman as to reach down that china jar for me,edgeworth-parents
yes sir replied maurice very fond of it for my father is a gardener and he lets me help him at his work and he has given me a little garden of my own,edgeworth-parents
arthur was the name of the nurseryman s son,edgeworth-parents
are you in your garden,edgeworth-parents
i am sorry for it said arthur who stood leaning upon his spade in his own garden i am afraid you will be very angry with me,edgeworth-parents
you must all die now,edgeworth-parents
look what i have got for you,edgeworth-parents
i am much happier since my father came to live here and since you and i have been allowed to work and to play together than i ever was before for you must know before we came to live here i had a cousin in the house with me who used to plague me,edgeworth-parents
it would be well for all the world if they could be convinced like arthur that to live in friendship is better than to quarrel,edgeworth-parents
when first he settled near mr grant the gardener he felt inclined to dislike him because he was told that mr grant was a scotchman and he had a prejudice against scotchmen all of whom he believed to be cunning and avaricious because he had once been over reached by a scotch peddler,edgeworth-parents
how came you pray neighbour grant if a man may ask by these wonderful fine raspberries,edgeworth-parents
you are always poring over some book or another when a man comes to see you which is not according to my notions being a plain unlarned englishman bred and born so civil and neighbourly as might be,edgeworth-parents
here s to the health of you and yours not forgetting the seedling larches which i see are coming on finely,edgeworth-parents
the answer which oakly s wife brought to him was that mr grant had not a raspberry plant in the world to give him and that if he had ever so many he would not give one away except to his own son,edgeworth-parents
with maurice grant i say i forbid you from this day and hour forward to have anything to do with him,edgeworth-parents
is there no other boy simpleton think you to play with but this scotchman s son,edgeworth-parents
oh father and shall i never go again to work in his garden and may not he come to mine,edgeworth-parents
arthur promised to obey his father,edgeworth-parents
now the message which grant really sent about the brobdingnag raspberries was somewhat different from that which mr oakly received,edgeworth-parents
oakly when he had once resolved to dislike his neighbour grant could not long remain without finding out fresh causes of complaint,edgeworth-parents
oakly paid his attorney ten golden guineas remarked that it was a great sum for him to pay and that nothing but the love of justice could make him persevere in this lawsuit about a bit of ground which after all said he is not worth twopence,edgeworth-parents
i fancy father said he those things are for you for there is a little note directed to you in maurice s handwriting,edgeworth-parents
but though you are angry with me i am not angry with you,edgeworth-parents
so wishing your brobdingnag raspberries may turn out as well as ours and longing to be all friends again i am with love to dear arthur and self your affectionate neighbour s son maurice grant,edgeworth-parents
what are you reading there,edgeworth-parents
there is a sort of strawberry cultivated at jersey which is almost covered with seaweed in the winter in like manner as many plants in england are with litter from the stable,edgeworth-parents
it is necessary to observe that this experiment has never been actually tried upon raspberry plants,edgeworth-parents
now the reason i tell you this is first that you may know how to manage your raspberries and next because i remember you looked very grave as if you were not pleased with my father mr grant when he told you that the way by which he came by his brobdingnag raspberries was a secret,edgeworth-parents
pray arthur do you know whether your friend maurice was born in england or in scotland,edgeworth-parents
it was given to me by maurice,edgeworth-parents
oh if you would cried arthur clapping his hands how happy we should be,edgeworth-parents
why this is the most cunning letter i ever read,edgeworth-parents
damages,edgeworth-parents
a bribe,edgeworth-parents
one of his own brobdingnag raspberry plants swung by the angry arm of oakly struck off the head of his precious tulip,edgeworth-parents
forgive and forget,edgeworth-parents
arthur s tulip was beautiful,edgeworth-parents
all the flowers of various sorts were ranged upon a terrace at the upper end of the bowling green and amongst all this gay variety the tulip which maurice had given to arthur appeared conspicuously beautiful,edgeworth-parents
so i did said maurice but somebody i suppose by accident broke it,edgeworth-parents
that was me that somebody was me said oakly,edgeworth-parents
mr oakly was mistaken the father would not accept of the tools,edgeworth-parents
said grant with surprise and oakly repeated exactly the message which he received and grant declared that he never sent any such message,edgeworth-parents
there was no holding out against his good nature,edgeworth-parents
oakly laughed at his own folly in having been persuaded to go to law about the plum tree and he in process of time so completely conquered his early prejudice against scotchmen that he and grant became partners in business,edgeworth-parents
mr gresham however did not imagine that a new house alone could make him happy,edgeworth-parents
they had been educated very differently,edgeworth-parents
his father had but a very small fortune and was anxious that his son should early learn that economy ensures independence and sometimes puts it in the power of those who are not very rich to be very generous,edgeworth-parents
exclaimed ben when he read the following words which were written in large characters over the chimney piece in his uncle s spacious kitchen,edgeworth-parents
mr gresham was called away whilst his nephews were looking at the other rooms in the house,edgeworth-parents
said mr gresham,edgeworth-parents
the two parcels were exactly alike both of them well tied up with good whip cord,edgeworth-parents
why how did you get yours undone man,edgeworth-parents
pooh,edgeworth-parents
you can get a bit of whip cord twice as long as that for twopence and who cares for twopence,edgeworth-parents
said mr gresham opening the parlour door as he spoke,edgeworth-parents
and you hal continued mr gresham you may keep your string too if it will be of any use to you,edgeworth-parents
said hal these tops have no strings what shall we do for strings,edgeworth-parents
i ll tell you what i can use the string that goes round my hat,edgeworth-parents
he had scarcely played half an hour before he split it by driving the peg too violently,edgeworth-parents
hal joyfully accepted the invitation,edgeworth-parents
little patty did not know anything about lady di s sons but as she was very good natured and saw that her cousin hal was for some reason or other in a desperate hurry she ran downstairs as fast as she possibly could towards the landing place where the handkerchief lay but alas,edgeworth-parents
here papa said the little girl touching her ankle which she had decently covered with her gown,edgeworth-parents
ben looked for it upon the stairs and he found it sticking in a loop of whip cord which was entangled round one of the bannisters,edgeworth-parents
that s right ben never be ashamed of being good natured to those who are younger and weaker than yourself said his uncle smiling at seeing him produce his whip cord to indulge his little cousin with a game at her favourite cat s cradle,edgeworth-parents
i wish the fortnight was over i shall think of nothing else i know till that happy day comes,edgeworth-parents
cried hal but you shall hear,edgeworth-parents
ben made no reply to this taunt at the moment but the next day when hal s new bow and arrow came home he convinced him that he knew how to use it very well,edgeworth-parents
said mr gresham,edgeworth-parents
you uncle,edgeworth-parents
take care how you do that said mr gresham for perhaps the lady was not mistaken,edgeworth-parents
my dear uncle but i assure you said hal earnestly there s no judging about the matter because really upon my word lady diana said distinctly that her sons were to have uniforms white faced with green and a green and white cockade in their hats,edgeworth-parents
i think said ben that he means to give me one if it is necessary or as he said if i think it is necessary,edgeworth-parents
we shall hear said ben with a degree of composure which hal could by no means comprehend when a uniform was in question,edgeworth-parents
all that can be done my dear boys in these difficult cases is to judge for yourselves which opinions and which people are the most reasonable,edgeworth-parents
hal s thoughts were however at present too full of the uniform to allow his judgment to act with perfect impartiality,edgeworth-parents
i must buy some of those good things for i have got some halfpence in my pocket,edgeworth-parents
i m not hungry said ben,edgeworth-parents
i wish i had more halfpence for you my good man said he but i ve only twopence,edgeworth-parents
hal next offered some of his cakes to his uncle and cousin but they thanked him and refused to eat any because they said they were not hungry so he ate and ate as he walked along till at last he stopped and said this bun tastes so bad after the queen cakes i can t bear it,edgeworth-parents
well there is the cake for you,edgeworth-parents
however with all my heart let us take a coach for ben asked me to show him the cathedral yesterday and i believe i should find it rather too much for me to walk so far though i am not sick with eating good things,edgeworth-parents
there was a dulness and melancholy kind of stupidity in hal s countenance as he pronounced these words like one wakening from a dream which made both his uncle and his cousin burst out a laughing,edgeworth-parents
hal s head was too full of the uniform to take any notice of the painted window which immediately caught ben s embarrassed attention,edgeworth-parents
we shall be late indeed said hal surely you ve looked long enough ben at this blue and red window,edgeworth-parents
hark,edgeworth-parents
and continued the lad who showed the cathedral he has lived here these many many winters,edgeworth-parents
the lad crumbled the bun and called to the robin who fluttered and chirped and seemed rejoiced at the sight of the bread but yet he did not come down from his pinnacle on the organ,edgeworth-parents
it s not his fault now,edgeworth-parents
where does your mother live,edgeworth-parents
said ben when they went out of the cathedral,edgeworth-parents
i ve often seen terrible looking tumble down places as we drove through the town in mamma s carriage but then i did not know who lived in them and i never saw the inside of any of them,edgeworth-parents
ben though he was all this time silent was as sorry as his talkative cousin for all these poor people,edgeworth-parents
uncle said ben stopping mr gresham before he got out of the carriage i don t think a uniform is at all necessary for me,edgeworth-parents
oh no said ben laughing i shall not change my mind,edgeworth-parents
it is right is it,edgeworth-parents
we sha n t want greatcoats yet,edgeworth-parents
now i will lay out this money for you just as you please,edgeworth-parents
certainly said his uncle,edgeworth-parents
to all this conclusive conditional reasoning which depended upon the word perhaps three times repeated mr gresham made no reply but he immediately bought the uniform for hal and desired that it should be sent to lady diana sweepstakes son s tailor to be made up,edgeworth-parents
gresham bought the coat and after it was paid for five and twenty shillings of ben s three guineas remained,edgeworth-parents
no uncle you only said a bow,edgeworth-parents
but go on how shall i dispose of these five and twenty shillings for you,edgeworth-parents
your best reward is in your own mind child and you want no other or i m mistaken,edgeworth-parents
you must take me with you said his pleased uncle i like to see people made happy as well as you do,edgeworth-parents
but i don t understand cousin hal said little patty why you call this bow a famous bow,edgeworth-parents
it means it is a word that people say it is the fashion to say it it means it means famous,edgeworth-parents
in short what does it signify talking any longer patty about the matter,edgeworth-parents
the long expected lst of september at length arrived,edgeworth-parents
said ben i shall be glad of my good great coat to day for i ve a notion it will be rather cold upon the downs especially when we are standing still as we must whilst all the people are shooting,edgeworth-parents
how do you do,edgeworth-parents
my ankle is entirely well and i m glad of that or else i should not be able to walk so far as the downs,edgeworth-parents
look at the sewing,edgeworth-parents
i observe for instance that you are a grateful little girl and that you are glad to be of use to those who have been kind to you and for this i forgive you the long stitch,edgeworth-parents
now is it not very extraordinary said hal to himself that they should go on so long talking about an old pair of gloves without saying scarcely a word about my new uniform,edgeworth-parents
mr stephen the butler here interrupted the hurrying young gentleman in his calculations,edgeworth-parents
here he comes oh ben he is dressed in the new coat you gave him whispered hal who was really a good natured boy though extravagant,edgeworth-parents
he made as little distinction as possible between his bows to the two cousins,edgeworth-parents
if you ll be pleased to take em they re better than they look for they bound higher than your head,edgeworth-parents
but now a thundering double rap at the door was heard,edgeworth-parents
i know that is just what was settled the day i dined at lady diana s and lady diana and a great party of gentlemen are to ride,edgeworth-parents
off with you then mr,edgeworth-parents
if you ll give me leave sir said the poor bristol lad i shall have plenty of time and i ll run down to the well walk after the young gentleman and take him his bow and arrows,edgeworth-parents
parties of gentlemen and ladies and a motley crowd of spectators were seen moving backwards and forwards under the rocks on the opposite side of the water,edgeworth-parents
they were now all in readiness,edgeworth-parents
hal had despatched a messenger for his forgotten bow but the messenger returned not,edgeworth-parents
it is that good natured poor fellow from bristol i protest that has brought it me i m sure i don t deserve it from him said hal to himself when he saw the lad with the black patch on his eye running quite out of breath towards him with his bow and arrows,edgeworth-parents
hal stepped proudly and felt as if the eyes of the whole universe were upon his epaulettes or upon the facings of his uniform whilst all the time he was considered only as part of a show,edgeworth-parents
now as we have before observed it was a sharp and windy day and though lady diana sweepstakes was actually speaking to him and looking at him he could not prevent his nose from wanting to be blowed he pulled out his handkerchief and out rolled the new ball which had been given to him just before he left home and which according to his usual careless habits he had stuffed into his pockets in his hurry,edgeworth-parents
the hat was too large for his head without this band a sudden gust of wind blew it off,edgeworth-parents
in the meantime the wind blew the hat down the hill and hal ran after it amidst the laughter of his kind friends the young sweepstakes and the rest of the little regiment,edgeworth-parents
his companions who had halted upon the top of the hill stood laughing spectators of his misfortune,edgeworth-parents
he was unwilling to give up his uniform it was rubbed and rubbed and a spot here and there was washed out and he kept continually repeating when it s dry it will all brush off when it s dry it will all brush off won t it,edgeworth-parents
nobody said he will take notice of my coat behind i daresay,edgeworth-parents
oh yes sir the butler said they had been gone to the downs a matter of a good half hour or more,edgeworth-parents
at length he reached the appointed spot,edgeworth-parents
oh let me in,edgeworth-parents
they were amongst the most unmerciful of the laughers,edgeworth-parents
don t stand there in the middle of the circle or you ll have an arrow in your eyes just now i ve a notion,edgeworth-parents
come back come behind these people said ben and put on my great coat here it is for you,edgeworth-parents
come come cried young sweepstakes i m within one inch of the mark who ll go nearer,edgeworth-parents
this young gentleman had good reasons for being so strict in these laws as he had observed that none of his companions had such an excellent bow as he had provided for himself,edgeworth-parents
he little knew how easily acquaintance who call themselves friends can change when their interest comes in the slightest degree in competition with their friendship,edgeworth-parents
but just as he pronounced the word luck and as he bent his bow the string broke in two and the bow fell from his hands,edgeworth-parents
you may shoot with your own bow if you choose it or you may not just as you think proper but you must not lend it sir,edgeworth-parents
ben before he ventured his last arrow prudently examined the string of his bow and as he pulled it to try its strength it cracked,edgeworth-parents
yes said ben as he fastened it to his bow i put it into my pocket to day on purpose because i thought i might happen to want it,edgeworth-parents
there could be no doubt,edgeworth-parents
it is a good thing to have two strings to one s bow,edgeworth-parents
old man,edgeworth-parents
you can t see him so go about your business i say,edgeworth-parents
only an old man miss with a complaint for my master,edgeworth-parents

just,edgeworth-parents

tell this story i don t know whether it tells well for me but i ll never be positive any more that s poz,edgeworth-parents
sensible of the extreme importance of early impressions and of the powerful influence of external circumstances in forming the characters and the manners they were now anxious that the variety of new ideas and new objects which would strike the minds of their children should appear in a just point of view,edgeworth-parents
during the first fortnight they scarcely saw or heard anything of one of the families who lodged on the same floor with them,edgeworth-parents
from this circumstance and from the benevolent countenance of the old gentleman they concluded that he was very fond of his sister and that they were certainly very happy except that they never spoke and could be seen only for a moment,edgeworth-parents
mrs theresa tattle at home,edgeworth-parents
she regularly consulted the subscriptions to the circulating libraries and the lists at the ball and the pump rooms so that with a memory unencumbered with literature and free from all domestic cares she contrived to retain a most astonishing and correct list of births deaths and marriages together with all the anecdotes amusing instructive or scandalous which are necessary to the conversation of a water drinking place and essential to the character of a very pleasant woman,edgeworth-parents
marianne sometimes passed very slowly by this door,edgeworth-parents
mr montague declining to sit down and make this lady understand a system of education only to give her something to say and showing unaccountable indifference about the attacks with which he was threatened mrs tattle next addressed herself to mrs montague prophesying in a most serious whisper that the charming miss marianne would shortly and inevitably grow quite crooked if she were not immediately provided with a back board a french dancing master and a pair of stocks,edgeworth-parents
neither was this universal adviser more successful in an attempt to introduce a tutor to frederick who she apprehended must want some one to perfect him in the latin and greek and dead languages of which she observed it would be impertinent for a woman to talk only she might venture to repeat what she had heard said by good authority that a competency of the dead tongues could be had nowhere but at a public school or else from a private tutor who had been abroad after the advantage of a classical education finished in one of the universities with a good family without which introduction it was idle to think of reaping solid advantages from any continental tour all which requisites from personal knowledge she could aver to be concentrated in the gentleman she had the honour to recommend as having been tutor to a young nobleman who had now no further occasion for him having unfortunately for himself and his family been killed in an untimely duel,edgeworth-parents
sophy whose taste had been cultivated at the same time with her powers of reasoning was not liable to fall into these errors,edgeworth-parents
said mrs tattle to herself if i had such a tall daughter and so unformed before my eyes from morning to night it would certainly break my poor heart,edgeworth-parents
people must think children are very silly or else they can never have reflected upon the nature of belief in their own minds if they imagine that children will believe the words that are said to them by way of moral when the countenance manner and every concomitant circumstance tell them a different tale,edgeworth-parents
instead of observing characters and manners that he might judge of them and form his own he now watched every person he saw that he might detect some foible or catch some singularity in their gesture or pronunciation which he might successfully mimic,edgeworth-parents
they did not choose to exact any promise from them which they might be tempted to break and therefore they only said at parting if mrs theresa tattle should ask you to come to her do as you think proper,edgeworth-parents
mrs theresa hopes they will all come at six or before not forgetting miss sophy if she will condescend to be of the party,edgeworth-parents
yes i know that said frederick,edgeworth-parents
no cried frederick could would should might and ought are all the same thing in the latin grammar all of em signs of the potential mood you know,edgeworth-parents
then why have two words for the same thing,edgeworth-parents
i was not disputing i was reasoning,edgeworth-parents
cried frederick exulting now we shall see a philosopheress in a passion i d give sixpence half price for a harlequin entertainment to see sophy in a passion,edgeworth-parents
cried frederick pointing to the colour which rose in her cheeks almost to her temples rising,edgeworth-parents
blood,edgeworth-parents
leave the thermometer to itself a little while,edgeworth-parents
see,edgeworth-parents
i m sure sophy found out how to tie that difficult knot which papa showed us yesterday long before you did though you are a man,edgeworth-parents
very well let her reason away said the provoking wit,edgeworth-parents
well,edgeworth-parents
said little marianne laughing,edgeworth-parents
well i say you ll never learn how to make a good pudding,edgeworth-parents
yes but you d never do it exactly and mind the spoonfuls right by the recipe like a cook,edgeworth-parents
i m sure sophy would make a much better pudding if exactness only were wanting,edgeworth-parents
why now look at her with her books and her drawings and all this apparatus,edgeworth-parents
chapter ii,edgeworth-parents
waiting,edgeworth-parents
marianne coloured a little for though she had precipitately followed her brother and though he had quieted her conscience for a moment by saying you know papa and mamma told us to do what we thought best yet she did not feel quite pleased with herself and it was not till after mrs theresa had exhausted all her compliments and half her macaroons that she could restore her spirits to their usual height,edgeworth-parents
now my dear what shall i help you to,edgeworth-parents
well then doctor what will you eat to day,edgeworth-parents
nothing,edgeworth-parents
used ma am used,edgeworth-parents
mar,edgeworth-parents
you might as well tell me to cut the table ma am,edgeworth-parents
mutton truly,edgeworth-parents
it s really very extraordinary mrs carbuncle,edgeworth-parents
patties ma am,edgeworth-parents
but nobody has any sense and i see no water plates anywhere lately,edgeworth-parents
my dear again marianne,edgeworth-parents
mr frederick you ll make me die with laughing,edgeworth-parents
dr carbuncle eats voraciously with his head down to his plate and dropping the sauce he buttons up his coat tight across the breast,edgeworth-parents
now brother suppose that it is after dinner said marianne and show us how the doctor goes to sleep,edgeworth-parents
knowing no better when they married her,edgeworth-parents
mrs theresa tattle has never had the pleasure of hearing you sing she s quite impatient to hear you sing,edgeworth-parents
i ve never sung once except for very particular people this winter,edgeworth-parents
certainly ma am i allow that you use a powerful argument but i assure you now i would do my best to oblige you but i absolutely have forgotten all my english songs,edgeworth-parents
frederick sings after much preluding,edgeworth-parents
she s a particular favourite of mine you must know and i mean to do her a piece of service the first opportunity by saying something or other that shall go round to her relations in northumberland and make them do something for her as well they may for they are all rolling in gold and won t give her a penny,edgeworth-parents
here s a newspaper sir pray let us have counsellor puff,edgeworth-parents
oh you most incomparable mimic,edgeworth-parents
stimulated by these plaudits frederick proceeded to show how colonel epaulette blew his nose flourished his cambric handkerchief bowed to lady diana periwinkle and admired her work saying done by no hands as you may guess but those of fairly fair,edgeworth-parents
they stare so like his without seeming to see anything all the while,edgeworth-parents
that is sir charles to the very life,edgeworth-parents
frederick,edgeworth-parents
what a deep sigh was there,edgeworth-parents
what man in the mask brother,edgeworth-parents
but one can t be surprised at meeting with extraordinary characters amongst that race of people actors by profession you know for they are brought up from the egg to make their fortune or at least their bread by their oddities,edgeworth-parents
i insist upon it said mrs theresa ringing the bell,edgeworth-parents
miss sophy has her books and drawings,edgeworth-parents
the door opened just as mrs tattle was going to ring the bell again for candles and the cowslip wine,edgeworth-parents
but no christopher answered and upon turning round mrs tattle instead of christopher beheld two little black figures which stood perfectly still and silent,edgeworth-parents
the chimney sweepers ma am an please your ladyship,edgeworth-parents
chimney sweepers,edgeworth-parents
yes for christopher,edgeworth-parents
mr eden madam,edgeworth-parents
christopher did you hear anything about it,edgeworth-parents
yes step down do and christopher bring up the cowslip wine and some more macaroons for my little marianne,edgeworth-parents
the other morning ma am early he and the other were down the hill sweeping in paradise row,edgeworth-parents
well said marianne impatiently,edgeworth-parents
so he says ma am and so the old gentleman went in and pulled the boy out of the chimney with much ado ma am,edgeworth-parents
but i finds him stupid and ill mannered like for i offered him a shilling ma am myself to tell about the wig but he put it back in a way that did not become such as he to no lady s butler ma am whereupon i turns to the slim fellow and he s smarterer and more mannerly ma am with a tongue in his head for his betters but he could not resolve me my question either for he was up at the top of the chimney the best part o the time and when he came down mr eden had his wig on but had his arm all bare and bloody ma am,edgeworth-parents
well well,edgeworth-parents
yes indeed said marianne and i m sure i think mr eden was very good,edgeworth-parents
it was at my lady battersby s ma am,edgeworth-parents
this will make an admirable story for my lady battersby the next time i see her,edgeworth-parents
now continued mrs theresa turning to frederick as soon as the servant had left the room now mr frederick montague i have a favour such a favour to ask of you it s a favour which only you can grant you have such talents and would do the thing so admirably and my lady battersby would quite adore you for it,edgeworth-parents
oh ma am said frederick i cannot promise you any such thing indeed,edgeworth-parents
if they do come home i will ask them about it said frederick hesitating for though he by no means wished to accept the invitation he had not yet acquired the necessary power of decidedly saying no,edgeworth-parents
no ma am said frederick but i said i would,edgeworth-parents
to be sure i may madam said frederick colouring from that species of emotion which is justly called false shame and which often conquers real shame to be sure ma am i may do as i please,edgeworth-parents
they hesitate between new motives and old principles,edgeworth-parents
you had very nearly made a most shocking blunder in putting it all upon poor lady battersby,edgeworth-parents
why not my love,edgeworth-parents
how you have made me beg and pray,edgeworth-parents
as to the old quaker who lodges above old ephraim eden my lady battersby and i have so much diversion about him,edgeworth-parents
now you who have so much invention and cleverness i have no invention myself but could you not hit upon some way of seeing him so that you might get him by heart,edgeworth-parents
oh tell it me you charming clever creature,edgeworth-parents
i declare i looked round and thought i heard the squeaking chimney sweeper was in the room,edgeworth-parents
oh it s an admirable invention,edgeworth-parents
oh no do not ring said frederick stopping her hand i don t mean to do it,edgeworth-parents
christopher shut the door,edgeworth-parents
he came down hisself to the kitchen to the sweeps though but wouldn t have as i heard him say his sister waked for no account,edgeworth-parents
christopher who had curiosity as well as his mistress when he returned with the chimney sweeper prolonged his own stay in the room by sweeping the hearth throwing down the tongs and shovel and picking them up again,edgeworth-parents
only just change clothes with the boy only just let me see what a charming chimney sweeper you d make,edgeworth-parents
i think he is in the right not to go up though he can do it so easily to see that gentleman i mean on purpose to mimic and laugh at him afterwards,edgeworth-parents
dear it s easy to be good in such little things and he won t have long to be good to her neither for i don t think she will trouble him long in this world anyhow,edgeworth-parents
die with that beautiful colour in her cheeks,edgeworth-parents
he says unless the waters work a miracle she stands a bad chance and she won t follow my advice and consult the doctor for her health,edgeworth-parents
nay miss marianne i don t commend you now,edgeworth-parents
cried mrs theresa,edgeworth-parents
and so he did and when frederick spoke the voice was so very like that it was scarcely possible that he should have perceived the difference,edgeworth-parents
i won t detain you,edgeworth-parents
they listened again and all was silent,edgeworth-parents
the hall was rather dark but under the lamp a crowd of people all the servants in the house having gathered together,edgeworth-parents
exclaimed mrs theresa,edgeworth-parents
mr and mrs montague will be here before he has done bleeding,edgeworth-parents
can nobody think of anything that will stop blood in a minute,edgeworth-parents
cried marianne catching hold of the words and terrified she ran upstairs crying sophy oh sophy,edgeworth-parents
come down or he ll be dead,edgeworth-parents
i did not know he was a gentleman,edgeworth-parents
i m glad to hear him speak like himself again at anyrate cried mrs theresa,edgeworth-parents
my brother,edgeworth-parents
miss sophy don t be alarmed mrs theresa began but gracious goodness,edgeworth-parents
oh miss eden your beautiful india muslin,edgeworth-parents
will he bleed to death,edgeworth-parents
miss bertha it s nothing but a frolic,edgeworth-parents
i thought it was his eye but i see it s only his nose,edgeworth-parents
make haste for fear your father and mother should drop in upon us,edgeworth-parents
don t betray me,edgeworth-parents
i shall say nothing about you i promise you said frederick with a look of contempt,edgeworth-parents
let him speak he was going to speak the truth,edgeworth-parents
here is a place said he to frederick where thou mayst speak the truth at all times and before everybody,edgeworth-parents
cried he,edgeworth-parents
sir i disguised myself in this dress i came up to your room to night on purpose to see you without your knowing it that i might mimic you,edgeworth-parents
he never guessed who i was,edgeworth-parents
the rest you saw,edgeworth-parents
oh that other hand,edgeworth-parents
and like a man and like a good man i am sure thou wilt said the good quaker shaking frederick s hand affectionately or i am much mistaken friend in that black countenance,edgeworth-parents
what will you do now,edgeworth-parents
frederick,edgeworth-parents
a story never tells so well the second time to be sure said mrs theresa but mr eden will certainly make the best of it,edgeworth-parents
i speak plainly friend for that is best,edgeworth-parents
now indeed mr frederick your papa and mamma have reason to be angry,edgeworth-parents
i protest mrs montague you take it too quietly,edgeworth-parents
he will i am persuaded judge and act for himself more wisely in future,edgeworth-parents
he used to torment everybody with do pray help me,edgeworth-parents
his aim the moment he came to a new school was to get to the head of it or at least to form the strongest party,edgeworth-parents
he went over to archer who considering him as a partisan deserting from the enemy received him with open arms and translated his whole lesson without expressing much contempt for his stupidity,edgeworth-parents
so that this premium now became a matter of the greatest consequence and archer instead of taking the means to secure a judgment in his favour was listening to the opinions of all his companions,edgeworth-parents
cried archer with affected gaiety as soon as the doctor had left the room well i m content with my sentence,edgeworth-parents
at this archer grew more and more angry and when fisher was proceeding to speak nonsense for him pushed forward into the circle to de grey crying i wish mr fisher you would let me fight my own battles,edgeworth-parents
come then,edgeworth-parents
echoed a multitude of voices,edgeworth-parents
when at length the acclamations had spent themselves he walked across the stage with a knowing air and looking round contemptuously,edgeworth-parents
who would be a servant of the public,edgeworth-parents
one observed that the green curtain was full of holes and would not draw up,edgeworth-parents
when he had done his auditors looked round sighed and wished that archer had been their manager,edgeworth-parents
i have done my best to please you but if anybody else can please you better i shall be glad of it,edgeworth-parents
no no pulling down,edgeworth-parents
down with it,edgeworth-parents
de grey looked on superior,edgeworth-parents
in this moment of silence there was heard something like a voice,edgeworth-parents
everybody looked round to see where the voice came from,edgeworth-parents
at length she fixed her eyes on de grey,edgeworth-parents
i what do i want,edgeworth-parents
had you ever your fortune told sir in your life,edgeworth-parents
for you will make your own fortune and the fortune of all that belong to you,edgeworth-parents
good luck to them,edgeworth-parents
happy he who had sixpence for he bid fair to be a judge upon the bench,edgeworth-parents
they hope to win when they cannot earn and as they can never be convinced by those who speak sense it is no wonder they are always persuaded by those who talk nonsense,edgeworth-parents
everybody else drew back and left him to whisper his question in the gipsy s ear,edgeworth-parents
the gipsy paused for information,edgeworth-parents
but how could you know it was dr middleton s name,edgeworth-parents
i lost it a week ago,edgeworth-parents
i must be gone,edgeworth-parents
he found all the world at supper but no entreaties could prevail upon him to disclose his secret,edgeworth-parents
his friends had imprudently supplied him with more money than is usually trusted to boys of his age,edgeworth-parents
was now his question,edgeworth-parents
put it to the vote,edgeworth-parents
amongst the archers was a class not very remarkable for their mental qualifications but who by their bodily activity and by the peculiar advantages annexed to their way of life rendered themselves of the highest consequence especially to the rich and enterprising,edgeworth-parents
since his father s death fisher had become a boarder at dr middleton s but his frequent visits to his aunt barbara afforded him opportunities of going into the town,edgeworth-parents
to which the carpenter readily assented and added that gentlemen of spirit never looked to the expense but always to the effect,edgeworth-parents
archer was obliged in the midst of his various occupations to perform the part of grammar and dictionary for twenty different people,edgeworth-parents
mr archer return to your place,edgeworth-parents
you will be so good as to dismiss him,edgeworth-parents
said townsend all our diversion is over,edgeworth-parents
he would stand by them if they would stand by him he declared with a loud voice against the whole world and dr middleton himself with little premiums at his right hand,edgeworth-parents
this you see is a stroke at me and my party and i won t bear it,edgeworth-parents
before i came here you reigned alone now your reign is over mr de grey,edgeworth-parents
i won t be governed by any man s reasons that he won t tell me cried archer,edgeworth-parents
why not,edgeworth-parents
don t be in a passion archer,edgeworth-parents
i ll go through with what i ve begun,edgeworth-parents
no before i came i say nobody dared oppose you but i dare and i tell you to your face take care of me a warm friend and a bitter enemy is my motto,edgeworth-parents
no you are my enemy,edgeworth-parents
you called me a greybeard but my name is de grey said he still laughing,edgeworth-parents
at the door archer was stopped by mr chip,edgeworth-parents
not much over sir but if you ll please to look into it you ll see tis for a few things you ordered,edgeworth-parents
cried he but i can t stay to talk about it now,edgeworth-parents
well master archer said he there s no refusing you nothing,edgeworth-parents
i know the way to manage everybody,edgeworth-parents
archers archers to the archers tree,edgeworth-parents
then we are all archers and we will stand by one another,edgeworth-parents
they all gave their honour to be secret and faithful as he called it and he went on,edgeworth-parents
did you ever try to push him back,edgeworth-parents
replied archer and is not he a schoolmaster,edgeworth-parents
impossible,edgeworth-parents
i see you are all greybeards,edgeworth-parents
we won t be slaves,edgeworth-parents
a disorderly privilege says the doctor which in his time prevailed in the principal seminaries of education,edgeworth-parents
it would have taken up too much time to examine what the right was,edgeworth-parents
the arrangement of the affair was left to their new manager to whom they all pledged implicit obedience,edgeworth-parents
whom do you mean,edgeworth-parents
no but you don t take me said fisher you don t take me,edgeworth-parents
do you know said he laying hold of archer s button i m in the secret,edgeworth-parents
with these instructions archer put his watch into the solemn dupe s hand and left him to count the seconds till the moment of his appointment whilst he ran off himself to prepare the oracle,edgeworth-parents
there s nobody near us,edgeworth-parents
lost,edgeworth-parents
pray in our barring out shall we be starved,edgeworth-parents
i must take care of that first,edgeworth-parents
my mouth waters for the buns and have em i must now,edgeworth-parents
he had within the last two hours got all their bars ready to fasten the doors and window shutters of the schoolroom he had with the assistance of two of the day scholars who were of the party sent into the town for provisions at his own expense which would make a handsome supper for that night he had also negotiated with some cousins of his who lived in the town for a constant supply in future,edgeworth-parents
we shall be in the dark man,edgeworth-parents
exclaimed archer you are a pretty fellow at a dead lift,edgeworth-parents
money man,edgeworth-parents
i don t know what you are at,edgeworth-parents
he returned but not until a considerable time afterwards,edgeworth-parents
i ve got the candles whispered fisher as he passed by archer to his place,edgeworth-parents
was not that clever,edgeworth-parents
a fourth was to take charge of the candle as soon as lighted and all the rest were to run to their bars which were secreted in a room then to fix them to the common fastening bars of the window in the manner in which they had been previously instructed by the manager,edgeworth-parents
the clock began to strike nine,edgeworth-parents
a light was struck and each ran to his post,edgeworth-parents
won t you let me out,edgeworth-parents
i should like to show him our fortifications,edgeworth-parents
townsend delighted with the bustle rubbed his hands and capered about the room whilst the preparations for the feast were hurried forward,edgeworth-parents
there s nothing like a fair scramble my boys,edgeworth-parents
no no cried fisher he sha n t sup with us,edgeworth-parents
tell me what s the latin for cold roast beef,edgeworth-parents
hang to morrow,edgeworth-parents
they looked up and beheld the rose of a watering engine whose long neck appeared through a trap door in the ceiling,edgeworth-parents
said archer,edgeworth-parents
the clock added he whispering must have been wrong for it had not done striking when we began,edgeworth-parents
were ye never in the dark before,edgeworth-parents
it s a wonder nobody ever thought of the trap door,edgeworth-parents
the light appeared,edgeworth-parents
lucifer matches were then unknown ed,edgeworth-parents
glass,edgeworth-parents
cried archer eat if you want it,edgeworth-parents
if these are the joys of a barring out cried townsend i d rather be snug in my bed,edgeworth-parents
begin townsend,edgeworth-parents
britons never will be slaves,edgeworth-parents
the voices died away and dropped off one by one,edgeworth-parents
in the night he had resolved the affair of the trap door and a new danger had alarmed him,edgeworth-parents
luckily there were round holes in the top of the window shutters which admitted sufficient light for him to work by,edgeworth-parents
now if i wanted which thank goodness i don t but if i did want to call a cabinet council to my assistance whom could i pitch upon,edgeworth-parents
i might kick him for my football this half hour before i should get him awake,edgeworth-parents
and how did it happen that he should be so ambitious to please and govern this set when for each individual of which it was composed he felt such supreme contempt,edgeworth-parents
accordingly he pulled two or three to waken them,edgeworth-parents
cried townsend i m your man,edgeworth-parents
all hands were now called to clear away the supper things to erect these forms perpendicularly under the trap door and with the assistance of a few braces a chevaux de frise was formed upon which nobody could venture to descend,edgeworth-parents
cried townsend,edgeworth-parents
this ventilator archer had taken down and had contrived it so that it could be easily removed and replaced at pleasure but upon examination it was now perceived that the hole had been newly stopped up by an iron back which it was impossible to penetrate or remove,edgeworth-parents
archer who well knew the effect which the apprehension of a scarcity would have upon his associates did everything that could be done by a bold countenance and reiterated assertions to persuade them that his cousins would certainly come at last and that the supplies were only delayed,edgeworth-parents
cried he with more joy sparkling in his eyes than had ever enlightened them before,edgeworth-parents
i ll give you one whole one for yourself if you will unbar the window for me,edgeworth-parents
so he summoned a council and proposed that everyone should subscribe and trust the subscription to the gipsy to purchase a fresh supply of provisions,edgeworth-parents
what a pity that so much ingenuity should have been employed to no purpose,edgeworth-parents
the morning had been very long and archer had in vain tried to dissuade them from devouring the remainder of the provisions before they were sure of a fresh supply,edgeworth-parents
he now experienced some of the joys of power and the delight of managing unreasonable numbers,edgeworth-parents
did not i set to work for you at sunrise,edgeworth-parents
is not this bun which i hold in my hand my own,edgeworth-parents
you all of you promised to obey me,edgeworth-parents
archer walked up and down unable to command his emotion whilst for the moment the discontented multitude was silenced,edgeworth-parents
you shall be my captain will you,edgeworth-parents
besides it s his own,edgeworth-parents
a few moments ago he had admired his own generosity and though he had felt the injustice of others he had not accused himself of any,edgeworth-parents
pooh,edgeworth-parents
he deserts his party,edgeworth-parents
i ll stick by the archers right or wrong i tell you to the last moment,edgeworth-parents
touch him who dares,edgeworth-parents
others stretching their arms and gaping as they sauntered up and down the room wished for air or food or water,edgeworth-parents
and whether he expected that they should starve themselves for his sake,edgeworth-parents
some he reminded of their promises others he praised for former prowess and others he shamed by the repetition of their high vaunts in the beginning of the business,edgeworth-parents
with all the force which rage could inspire archer struggled and roared to his archers,edgeworth-parents
all alive and kicking,edgeworth-parents
he s loose,edgeworth-parents
can such a thing as you have a party,edgeworth-parents
i have nine fishermen,edgeworth-parents
cried they,edgeworth-parents
you are a mighty good fellow when the sun shines but let a storm come and how you slink away,edgeworth-parents
we want something to eat answered the fishermen,edgeworth-parents
i ve advised my party if they ve a mind not to be starved to give you up for the ringleader as you were and dr middleton will not let us all off i daresay,edgeworth-parents
cried he,edgeworth-parents
breakfast,edgeworth-parents
de grey promised upon his honour that if he would unbar the door nobody should come in with him and no advantage should be taken of them,edgeworth-parents
a hundred questions were asked him at once,edgeworth-parents
does dr middleton know,edgeworth-parents
everyone looked at the empty basket,edgeworth-parents
you would have found it no hard task to have persuaded or convinced us whichever you pleased said townsend if you had appealed to archers fasting but archers feasting are quite other animals,edgeworth-parents
and it would have been just as difficult i promise you to persuade or convince me either that i should give up against my honour before breakfast as after,edgeworth-parents
why don t you remember that dinner time and supper time and breakfast time will come again,edgeworth-parents
i d rather be flogged at once as i have been many s the good time for a less thing,edgeworth-parents
don t address yourself to me interrupted archer struggling with his pride you have no further occasion to try to win me,edgeworth-parents
de grey was going to assure him that he had no intention of joining any party when a sudden change appeared on archer s countenance,edgeworth-parents
cried he looking at de grey with triumph that s a method of holding secret correspondence whilst a prisoner which i learned from richard coeur de lion,edgeworth-parents
cried he going to the ventilator,edgeworth-parents
pull away,edgeworth-parents
make haste pull away,edgeworth-parents
let down quick,edgeworth-parents
fill the bag then,edgeworth-parents
a delightful review was now made of their treasure,edgeworth-parents
and you townsend said archer may look like a wit if you will but you will never be a hero,edgeworth-parents
i don t want to restrain anybody s wit but i cannot say i admire puns,edgeworth-parents
continued he with sudden familiarity what a sight of good things are here,edgeworth-parents
why now we may defy the doctor and the greybeards,edgeworth-parents
he asked impatiently,edgeworth-parents
dr middleton trusted me and now he will repent of his confidence in me,edgeworth-parents
interrupted townsend are heroes allowed to change sides pray,edgeworth-parents
i see what parties are made of,edgeworth-parents
exclaimed archer,edgeworth-parents
well then i ll give up to do what is honourable said archer,edgeworth-parents
but how will he find out what is honourable unless he can reason,edgeworth-parents
but you cannot think anything honourable or the contrary observed de grey without reasoning and as to what you call feeling it s only a quick sort of reasoning,edgeworth-parents
you must however acknowledge replied de grey smiling that no man but a fool thinks it honourable to be in the wrong at last,edgeworth-parents
no replied archer but i should never have thought of heading a barring out if he had not shown partiality and if you had flown into a passion with me openly at once for pulling down your scenery which would have been quite natural and not have gone slily and forbid us the house out of revenge there would have been none of this work,edgeworth-parents
now you are my friend indeed,edgeworth-parents
not quite,edgeworth-parents
not i,edgeworth-parents
said archer and with great eagerness he pulled down the fortifications whilst every hand assisted,edgeworth-parents
they were not yet at liberty,edgeworth-parents
hush,edgeworth-parents
it is no delight to me to see people on their knees,edgeworth-parents
i submit,edgeworth-parents
vengeance never looks to the future but is the expression of anger for an injury that is past,edgeworth-parents
how good,edgeworth-parents
i shall never revenge but it is my duty to punish,edgeworth-parents
your parents at least think so or they would not have intrusted me with the care of your education,edgeworth-parents
name it yourself said dr middleton and show me that you now understand the nature of punishment,edgeworth-parents
this guinea is all that i have left,edgeworth-parents
i give you an opportunity of recovering my confidence by your punctuality,edgeworth-parents
here the boys with one accord ran to the place where they had deposited their last supplies,edgeworth-parents
the gipsies were yesterday removed from the town,edgeworth-parents
the paper appeared to be a bill for candles and a tinder box,edgeworth-parents
to obtain credit for the tinder box and candles he made use of this name said he turning to the other side of the bill and pointing to de grey s name which was written at the end of a copy of one of de grey s exercises,edgeworth-parents
nothing in this whole business gave me half so much pain as i felt for a moment when i suspected that de grey was concerned in it,edgeworth-parents
as for you mr fisher depart you must never return hither again,edgeworth-parents
this task she had undertaken and twenty young persons were put under her care with the perfect confidence of their parents,edgeworth-parents
nothing so much contributed to preserve a spirit of emulation in this little society as a small honorary distinction given annually as a prize of successful application,edgeworth-parents
cecilia was the most intimate friend of leonora but leonora was only the favourite companion of cecilia,edgeworth-parents
in short leonora was the most anxious to avoid what was wrong cecilia the most ambitious to do what was right,edgeworth-parents
seats for the young competitors were raised one above another in a semicircle some yards distant from the table and the judges chairs under canopies of lilacs and laburnums forming another semicircle closed the amphitheatre,edgeworth-parents
the works were examined the preference adjudged and the prize was declared to be the happy cecilia s,edgeworth-parents
mrs villars kissed cecilia s little hand,edgeworth-parents
consider that though you are good you may be better and though wise you may be weak,edgeworth-parents
oh my mandarin,edgeworth-parents
in turning louisa threw down the remains of the mandarin,edgeworth-parents
leonora however preserved her usual consistency,edgeworth-parents
but you could have helped laughing cecilia,edgeworth-parents
i can do no more can i,edgeworth-parents
when she got to the end of the garden she turned round to see if leonora had followed her too but was vexed to see her still sitting on the steps with louisa,edgeworth-parents
her thoughts were discomposed and her mind was running upon something else,edgeworth-parents
they all yielded to the hand which wore the bracelet,edgeworth-parents
cecilia s companions at length recollected that though she had embroidered a tulip and painted a peach better than they yet that they could play as well and keep their tempers better for she was discomposed,edgeworth-parents
are we friends,edgeworth-parents
not confess that you were in the wrong,edgeworth-parents
unjust,edgeworth-parents
and when it was broken could i do more than promise her another was that unjust,edgeworth-parents
how can you compare louisa to me,edgeworth-parents
leonora declined dancing but they prevailed upon her to sing for them,edgeworth-parents
louisa silently let go her companion s hand and quitting the dance ran up to leonora to inquire what was the matter with her,edgeworth-parents
the injury however louisa had already forgotten,edgeworth-parents
no said louisa mysteriously i am not eating them,edgeworth-parents
why should not i call you child,edgeworth-parents
see how unjust you are,edgeworth-parents
how,edgeworth-parents
you don t don t you,edgeworth-parents
said cecilia recollecting herself louisa,edgeworth-parents
and hear me,edgeworth-parents
gone,edgeworth-parents
said she sobbing,edgeworth-parents
oh i don t mind the strawberries indeed but i wanted to have had the pleasure of giving them to you,edgeworth-parents
at this instant the bell summoned them in,edgeworth-parents
leonora,edgeworth-parents
oh no indeed she has not a bad heart,edgeworth-parents
how i love you,edgeworth-parents
so don t stay now,edgeworth-parents
saying these words cecilia threw herself down upon the ground her arm leaned upon a heap of turf which she had raised in the morning and which in the pride and gaiety of her heart she had called her throne,edgeworth-parents
it is i madam,edgeworth-parents
this is perhaps one of the happiest days of your life,edgeworth-parents
you know that when i ask you to tell me anything as your friend i never punish you as your governess therefore you need not be afraid to tell me what is the matter,edgeworth-parents
and i see that they all dislike me and yet i don t know why they should for i take as much pains to please as any of them,edgeworth-parents
then if it had been for the most amiable it would not have been for me,edgeworth-parents
therefore i must judge of what i should do by seeing what others do in the same circumstances,edgeworth-parents
but madam by good natured i mean good tempered it s all the same thing,edgeworth-parents
i wish that mine could,edgeworth-parents
but you must not expect to succeed all at once,edgeworth-parents
hope was too strong a stimulus for her spirits and when fear did take possession of her mind it was attended with total debility,edgeworth-parents
why what put that into your head,edgeworth-parents
and why do they hate it,edgeworth-parents
well then to begin with what you do understand tell me cecilia do you really think it possible to be wicked merely for the love of wickedness,edgeworth-parents
indeed madam i never did until everybody told me so and then i began to be frightened about it,edgeworth-parents
they do not perceive the motive which actuates you and then they say that you have a bad heart,edgeworth-parents
i hope i am sure i never shall,edgeworth-parents
good night to you madam said cecilia and she ran upstairs to bed,edgeworth-parents
perhaps it would not yesterday perhaps it might not to morrow but that is no reason that i should despair of ever deserving it,edgeworth-parents
they formed the most beautiful gradation of colours from the palest auburn to the brightest black,edgeworth-parents
for it is habit which confers ease and without ease even in moral actions there can be no grace,edgeworth-parents
how foolish,edgeworth-parents
cecilia lost more love by general petulance than she could gain by the greatest particular exertions,edgeworth-parents
their quarrel had never been finally adjusted and their different pretensions now retarded all thoughts of a reconciliation,edgeworth-parents
animated with this hope of a double triumph cecilia canvassed with the most zealous activity,edgeworth-parents
this was the fundamental error of her mind it arose in a great measure from her early education,edgeworth-parents
leonora on the contrary who had been educated by her mother in a manner more suited to her sex had a character and virtues more peculiar to a female,edgeworth-parents
the uniform kindness of her manner the consistency and equality of her character had fixed the esteem and passive love of her companions,edgeworth-parents
without determining which species of love is the most flattering to others we can easily decide which is the most agreeable feeling to our minds,edgeworth-parents
in the morning nothing was to be seen but these shells nothing talked of but the long expected event of the evening,edgeworth-parents
they were both assiduous in their care of louisa but leonora s want of exertion to overcome any disagreeable feelings of sensibility often deprived her of presence of mind and prevented her from being so constantly useful as cecilia,edgeworth-parents
then first returning into the hall she found the peddler just unbuckling his box and taking it off his shoulders,edgeworth-parents
have you any china figures,edgeworth-parents
only three shillings ma am,edgeworth-parents
said cecilia eagerly,edgeworth-parents
how beautiful,edgeworth-parents
said she to herself and at last breaking silence did you promise it to the old lady,edgeworth-parents
alas,edgeworth-parents
oh i have it said she taking it up and looking at it with the utmost disgust,edgeworth-parents
no said cecilia hastily blushing a little and stretching out her hand to receive it,edgeworth-parents
then putting the flora deliberately into the case and turning the key with a jerk he let it drop into his pocket when lifting up his box by the leather straps he was preparing to depart,edgeworth-parents
though when i come to look at this mandarin it is not even so good as hers was,edgeworth-parents
here cecilia s hand moved and she was just going to decide oh but stop said she to herself consider leonora gave me this box and it is a keepsake,edgeworth-parents
and have i not a right to do what i please with it,edgeworth-parents
she ran by without seeming to mind any of her companions,edgeworth-parents
in the meantime leonora had gone into the hall to buy a bodkin she had just broken hers,edgeworth-parents
she intended to give it to little louisa,edgeworth-parents
i didn t hear you come in but what have you got there,edgeworth-parents
i am very much obliged to you i always thought that exceedingly pretty and this indeed is as like it as possible,edgeworth-parents
look don t you see a great l at the bottom of it,edgeworth-parents
do go and ask her if she has lost her box do repeated louisa pulling her by the ruffle as she did not seem to listen,edgeworth-parents
and why should he keep it in his pocket and not show it with his other things,edgeworth-parents
i daresay she had lost it,edgeworth-parents
cecilia opened the door came forward smiling as if secure of a good reception and taking the flora out of the case she placed it on the mantlepiece opposite to louisa s bed,edgeworth-parents
said the ingenuous louisa,edgeworth-parents
i should only have done what i was bound to do if i had only given you a mandarin,edgeworth-parents
you shall give it to me entirely and as your keepsake i ll keep it as long as i live,edgeworth-parents
good bye said she running up and kissing her but i ll come again presently then clapping the door after her she went,edgeworth-parents
and i have concealed it too and have been making a parade of my generosity,edgeworth-parents
her father s word to her brother on the occasion she also perfectly recollected,edgeworth-parents
this very evening in a few hours the prize will be decided,edgeworth-parents
here a bell summoned them to dinner,edgeworth-parents
must not this evening be given to the most amiable,edgeworth-parents
cecilia s voice could be distinguished far above the rest,edgeworth-parents
surely she did once love me said leonora but now she is quite changed,edgeworth-parents
let me be just though she has offended me she is wonderfully improved within this last month,edgeworth-parents
come in said louisa i m not asleep,edgeworth-parents
inquired leonora,edgeworth-parents
i know that she is particularly anxious for your preference and i am sure that she deserves it,edgeworth-parents
asked louisa i don t like her for being jealous of you,edgeworth-parents
but dear leonora why should you lose it,edgeworth-parents
will you never come,edgeworth-parents
said the little louisa and the tears started into her eyes,edgeworth-parents
what are you about,edgeworth-parents
remember then that you have promised me said leonora and she left the room,edgeworth-parents
she stood still at last to admire her works,edgeworth-parents
cecilia was left alone,edgeworth-parents
in a few moments goodness,edgeworth-parents
they are gone to seek for her,edgeworth-parents
they most of them ran forwards to cecilia,edgeworth-parents
well,edgeworth-parents
count them caroline,edgeworth-parents
then snatching the bracelet it is yours leonora said she take it and give me back your friendship,edgeworth-parents
you will soon despise me,edgeworth-parents
she had heard all that passed from her window,edgeworth-parents
you have forgotten louisa,edgeworth-parents
mrs villars produced another box,edgeworth-parents
leonora caught it,edgeworth-parents
dear cecilia said leonora you need not tell it me i know it already and i forgive you with all my heart,edgeworth-parents
now i don t love cecilia half so well as i do leonora,edgeworth-parents
if anybody else had told me so i could not have believed them because i remember the box so well but i can t help believing leonora,edgeworth-parents
well said i give me the box and i will carry your shell in it to cecilia,edgeworth-parents
you cannot refuse it i only follow your example,edgeworth-parents
oh yes louisa exclaimed everybody with one voice,edgeworth-parents
they looked up to leonora with respectful and affectionate admiration,edgeworth-parents
remember that many of our sex are capable of great efforts of making what they call great sacrifices to virtue or to friendship but few treat their friends with habitual gentleness or uniformly conduct themselves with prudence and good sense,edgeworth-parents
those who have visited italy give us an agreeable picture of the cheerful industry of the children of all ages in the celebrated city of naples,edgeworth-parents
the children are busied in various ways,edgeworth-parents
other children carry about for sale the water of the sulphurous wells which particularly in the spring season is drunk in great abundance,edgeworth-parents
the fair dealer is always sooner or later seen to prosper,edgeworth-parents
the boy profited much by his father s precepts and more by his example he always heard his father speak the truth and saw that he dealt fairly with everybody,edgeworth-parents
he taught him that to make a good bargain was to deceive as to the value and price of whatever he wanted to dispose of to get as much money as possible from customers by taking advantage of their ignorance or of their confidence,edgeworth-parents
chi compra ha bisogna di cent occhi chi vende n ha assai di uno,edgeworth-parents
what will you do with piedro as he grows up neighbour,edgeworth-parents
he is but a child yet and knows no better replied the fisherman,edgeworth-parents
i speak for your son s sake and not for the sake of my grapes said the gardener and i tell you again the boy will not do well in the world neighbour if you don t look after him in time,edgeworth-parents
e meglio esser fortunato che savio,edgeworth-parents
here take these fish to naples and let us see how you ll sell them for me,edgeworth-parents
do you know i saw him the other day miss selling a melon for his father by turning the bruised side to the customer who was just laying down the money for it and who was a raw servant boy moreover one who would never have guessed there were two sides to a melon if he had not as you say father been told of it,edgeworth-parents
perfectly said the boy who perceived that his father was indifferent as to his honesty provided he sold fish at the highest price possible,edgeworth-parents
fine fresh fish,edgeworth-parents
the servant boy was imposed upon and being a foreigner speaking the italian language but imperfectly and not being expert at reckoning the italian money he was no match for the cunning piedro who cheated him not only as to the freshness but as to the price of the commodity,edgeworth-parents
the panniers were indeed not only filled to the top but piled up with much skill and care so that the load met over the animal s back,edgeworth-parents
not before my father thinks i have done enough but before i think so myself replied francisco,edgeworth-parents
neither did i get what you see by begging or borrowing either said piedro but by using my wits not as you did yesterday when like a novice you showed the bruised side of your melon and so spoiled your market by your wisdom,edgeworth-parents
mine is of a different way of thinking said piedro,edgeworth-parents
stay said francisco you forgot that the booby you took in to day will not be so easily taken in to morrow,edgeworth-parents
and do you mean to serve them all in the same manner,edgeworth-parents
and you have never considered then said francisco that all these people will one after another find you out in time,edgeworth-parents
why now suppose the blockheads after they had been taken in and found it out all joined against me and would buy none of our fish what then,edgeworth-parents
would they be hard to deal with think you,edgeworth-parents
yes for the honest dealer said francisco but for no other for in all of them you ll find as my father says that a good character is the best fortune to set up with,edgeworth-parents
ay stroke the long ears of your ass and look as wise as you please,edgeworth-parents
unless you were honest francisco you would not fill his panniers quite so readily,edgeworth-parents
he left his native country of which he was extremely fond to attend upon his master to whom he was still more attached,edgeworth-parents
they heard his cry of fresh fish,edgeworth-parents
the market was well supplied and he could not get rid of his cargo,edgeworth-parents
how does he know that you deserve it better,edgeworth-parents
il cane scottato dell acqua calda ha paura poi della fredda,edgeworth-parents
is he not well,edgeworth-parents
i ll come to your village,edgeworth-parents
arthur the english servant was as good as his word,edgeworth-parents
it is fair you should have a share of our profits,edgeworth-parents
with these make a fine figure amongst the little neapolitan merchants and all i wish is that you may prosper as well and by the same honest means in managing for yourself as you have done managing for me,edgeworth-parents
it is easy to outwit one person but impossible to outwit all the world said a man who knew the world at least as well as either piedro or his father,edgeworth-parents
where glutton do you find money to pay for these dainties,edgeworth-parents
said his father,edgeworth-parents
this beating did the boy no good it was vengeance not punishment,edgeworth-parents
on the contrary he was hardened to the sense of shame by the loss of reputation,edgeworth-parents
if you would cheat your own father to be sure you will cheat us was continually said to him by these prudent little people,edgeworth-parents
piedro spent a whole winter very unhappily,edgeworth-parents
something like this was the sentiment of our cunning hero when he experienced the evils of a bad reputation and when he saw the numerous advantages which francisco s good character procured,edgeworth-parents
he was a melancholy spectacle,edgeworth-parents
i was very hungry and that s what i am now without anybody s caring anything about it,edgeworth-parents
won t your father be apt to miss them,edgeworth-parents
and to me less than anybody replied piedro in an insinuating tone that am so much obliged to you,edgeworth-parents
if you would but take me along with you amongst them and only just seem my friend for a day or two or so it would quite set me up again for they all like you,edgeworth-parents
partnership,edgeworth-parents
you d find me a very active partner,edgeworth-parents
you shall have what share of the profits you please,edgeworth-parents
say what you please for me,edgeworth-parents
adieu i wish you well with all my heart but i must leave you now or i shall be too late for the market,edgeworth-parents
when he went into the market with his grapes and figs he found that he was not shunned or taunted as usual,edgeworth-parents
his grapes and figs were quickly sold and with the money that he got for them he the next day purchased from a fruit dealer a fresh supply and thus he went on for some time conducting himself with scrupulous honesty so that he acquired some credit among his companions,edgeworth-parents
i make but a few shillings a day and this is but slow work said he to himself,edgeworth-parents
he observed that the younger part of the community were extremely fond of certain coloured sugar plums and of burnt almonds,edgeworth-parents
crowds of children surrounded piedro s board of promise and they all went away the first day amply satisfied,edgeworth-parents
this belief and piedro s popularity continued longer even than he had expected and as he thought his sugar plums had secured their reputation with the generous public he gradually neglected to add burnt almonds gratis,edgeworth-parents
this promises rarely,edgeworth-parents
here s for myself and here s for my sister s share said he laying down his money and now for the burnt almonds gratis my good fellow,edgeworth-parents
what,edgeworth-parents
why must the board tell a lie to day,edgeworth-parents
i never dreamed of injuring you or anyone else said carlo i wish moreover you may not injure yourself,edgeworth-parents
your measure does not fill my box nearly you give us very few sugar plums for our money,edgeworth-parents
an inch every way and yet by my eye and i have no bad one being used to measuring carpenter s work for my father by my eye i should think this would have held more sugar plums,edgeworth-parents
piedro changed colour terribly and seizing hold of the tin box endeavoured to wrest it from the youth who measured so accurately,edgeworth-parents
a discovery that concerns all who have ever bought the sweetest and most admirable sugar plums ever sold in naples,edgeworth-parents
cried several voices,edgeworth-parents
so we have been finely duped indeed cried some of the bystanders looking at one another with a mortified air,edgeworth-parents
said carlo going up to this silent person,edgeworth-parents
he is a neighbour of ours and i pitied him but since he is at his old tricks again there s an end of the matter,edgeworth-parents
exclaimed a number of little merchants crowding round him,edgeworth-parents
the cries of the enraged populace were now most clamorous,edgeworth-parents
break his bench,edgeworth-parents
it was after being much disfigured by various inscriptions expressive of the universal contempt for piedro hung up in a conspicuous part of the market place and the false measure was fastened like a cap upon one of its corners,edgeworth-parents
he examined it carefully and he found carlo s name written upon it and the name of the street where he lived and though it was considerably out of his way he set out immediately to restore the rule which was a very handsome one to its rightful owner,edgeworth-parents
you may guess i should have been sorry enough to have lost it,edgeworth-parents
why yes said francisco since you are so good natured perhaps you d be kind enough to tell me the meaning of some of those lines and figures that i see upon your rule,edgeworth-parents
oh never fear replied carlo laughing,edgeworth-parents
why said carlo you ll find all these things are nothing when you are used to them,edgeworth-parents
besides you ll see my father and he ll show you plenty of rules and compasses as you like such things and then i ll go home with you in the cool of the evening and you shall show me your melons and vines and teach me in time something of gardening,edgeworth-parents
said francisco as he was sitting one morning with his tutor the carpenter,edgeworth-parents
safe companions these for young and old,edgeworth-parents
said her brother carlo and he went up to her and wiped them from her cheeks,edgeworth-parents
said her brother looking at a heap of shells which she held before her in her frock,edgeworth-parents
that was not wise to leave it said carlo,edgeworth-parents
that was the reason i was in such a hurry to get them,edgeworth-parents
oh i forgot did not i tell you that,edgeworth-parents
won t that be better than crying,edgeworth-parents
and is this piece of wood from which the carpenter cut it still to be seen,edgeworth-parents
on their part her companions eagerly untied their faggots to show them to her and exclaimed that they were incapable of taking what did not belong to them that of all persons they should never have thought of taking anything from the good natured little rosetta who was always ready to give to others and to help them in making up their loads,edgeworth-parents
this was at the baker s i think where i went for some rolls for my master,edgeworth-parents
baker,edgeworth-parents
this is my bit of wood i am sure i know it by this notch said rosetta,edgeworth-parents
i hope he is not the boy who sold you the wood mr,edgeworth-parents
piedro being very certain that nobody saw him when he emptied rosetta s basket and imagining that he was suspected only upon the bare assertion of a child like rosetta who might be baffled and frightened out of her story boldly denied the charge and defied any one to prove him guilty,edgeworth-parents
arthur could not especially as he spoke wretched italian make the eager little merchants understand the nature and advantages of an english trial by jury,edgeworth-parents
but all that he could say could not alter facts,edgeworth-parents
thus a third time he deprived himself of the means of earning his bread,edgeworth-parents
piedro knew that it was the custom to pay of course for all that was broken but this he was not inclined to do,edgeworth-parents
he contrived during the course of autumn and winter to make himself a tolerable arithmetician,edgeworth-parents
all that i have done has been done by hard labour,edgeworth-parents
ay that rule said francisco how much i owe to it,edgeworth-parents
when his son had once said to him i spend my time at such a place and in such and such a manner he was as well convinced of its being so as if he had watched and seen him every moment of the day,edgeworth-parents
it was the utmost stretch of arthur s complaisance to pay this visit but in spite of his national prejudices and habitual reserve of temper he was pleased with the reception he met with from the generous carlo and the playful rosetta,edgeworth-parents
though not quite so partial a judge as the enthusiastic carlo this gentleman was both pleased and surprised at the sight of these drawings considering how short a time francisco had applied himself to this art and what slight instructions he had received,edgeworth-parents
we must give those of our young english readers who may not be acquainted with the ancient city of herculaneum some idea of it,edgeworth-parents
about 17oo years ago during the reign of the roman emperor titus there happened a terrible eruption of mount vesuvius and a large city called herculaneum which was situated at about four miles distance from the volcano was overwhelmed by the streams of lava which poured into it filled up the streets and quickly covered over the tops of the houses so that the whole was no more visible,edgeworth-parents
some persons had the curiosity to enter into this hole and after creeping underground for some time they came to the foundations of houses,edgeworth-parents
the workmen as they cleared the passages marked their way with chalk when they came to any turning lest they should lose themselves,edgeworth-parents
columns of red and white marble and flights of steps are seen in different places and out of the ruins of the palaces some very fine statues and pictures have been dug,edgeworth-parents
chapter iii,edgeworth-parents
what an advantage your instruction would be to him said mr lee as he introduced francisco to signor camillo,edgeworth-parents
signor camillo made no difficulties he was pleased with his pupil s appearance and every day he liked him better and better,edgeworth-parents
what,edgeworth-parents
but signor i never saw it said francisco respectfully or perhaps i should have preferred it,edgeworth-parents
i hoped indeed that the time would come when you would have the goodness to show them to me,edgeworth-parents
his confidence in francisco was much increased by this circumstance slight as it may appear,edgeworth-parents
i have obtained leave for you to accompany me said his master and you know i suppose that this is not a permission granted to everyone,edgeworth-parents
there are niches in the walls in several places from which pictures have been dug and these niches are often adorned with elegant masques figures and animals which have been left by the ignorant or careless workmen and which are going fast to destruction,edgeworth-parents
here my dear mother cried francisco pouring the guineas into her lap and here continued he emptying a bag which contained about as much more in small italian coins the profits of trade money he had fairly earned during the two years he sold fruit amongst the little neapolitan merchants this is all yours dearest mother and i hope it will be enough to pay for the brindled cow,edgeworth-parents
it was a delicious evening they left naples just as the sea breeze after the heats of the day was most refreshingly felt,edgeworth-parents
the company who were all pleased with each other and with the gardener s good fruit which he produced in great abundance did not think of separating till late,edgeworth-parents
he never missed an opportunity of showing his friends that he did not forget their former kindness to him,edgeworth-parents
the moon shone full upon his countenance which was very expressive and which varied frequently according to the characters of the persons whose history he was telling according to all the changes of their fortune,edgeworth-parents
the hat was dropped just as francisco and his two friends came under the piazza,edgeworth-parents
this is not my hat it has been changed whilst i was taken up with my story,edgeworth-parents
everybody present examined their hats and showed them to dominicho but his was not amongst them,edgeworth-parents
piedro when he saw himself discovered burst into a loud laugh and throwing down dominicho s hat which he held in his hand behind him cried a pretty set of novices,edgeworth-parents
remember the old proverb no fox so cunning but he comes to the furrier s at last,edgeworth-parents
francisco a word with you if you have done crying at the pitiful story you have been listening to so attentively,edgeworth-parents
you need not be ashamed of being seen in my company now i can tell you for i am as i always told you i should be the richest man of the two,edgeworth-parents
impossible,edgeworth-parents
moreover i am well with my father at home,edgeworth-parents
neither do i sell sugar plums to children nor do i slave myself in a vineyard like some folks but fortune when i least expected it has stood my friend,edgeworth-parents
what say you to all this francisco the honest,edgeworth-parents
,edgeworth-parents
he showed me one of the gold pieces,edgeworth-parents
he that would live in peace and rest must hear and see and say the best,edgeworth-parents
regardless or pretending to be regardless of these suspicions piedro and his father persisted in their assertions,edgeworth-parents
compute the morn and evening of their day,edgeworth-parents
he found the truth of the proverb that credit lost is like a venice glass broken it can t be mended again,edgeworth-parents
she was too much alarmed for the first ten minutes after her accident to think of anything but after some time she perceived that she had lost a valuable diamond cross which she had worn that night at the opera,edgeworth-parents
it was late he waited till the streets were cleared and then knocked softly at the back door of the jew s house,edgeworth-parents
only to ask my way my shortest way stammered piedro,edgeworth-parents
his father could but just see its lustre by the light of a dim lamp which hung over their heads in the gloomy passage in which they stood,edgeworth-parents
go your ways home then said his father it is safe with me,edgeworth-parents
he promised him that he should have half of whatever the jew would give for the diamonds and piedro insisted upon being present at the transaction,edgeworth-parents
it is said that ill gotten wealth is quickly spent and so it proved in this instance,edgeworth-parents
vien presto consumato l ingiustamente acquistato,edgeworth-parents
we turn with pleasure from piedro the cunning to francisco the honest,edgeworth-parents
his servant arthur always considered every generous action of his master s as his own and was particularly pleased whenever this generosity was directed towards francisco,edgeworth-parents
and i like his way he does more than he says,edgeworth-parents
one morning francisco was sent to finish a sketch of the front of an ancient temple amongst the ruins of herculaneum,edgeworth-parents
they retired in hopes of finding a more gentle padrona at some other well in the neighbourhood and the fury when they were out of sight divided the long black hair which hung over her face and turning to one of the spectators appealed to them in a sober voice and asked if she was not right in what she had done,edgeworth-parents
nor in any of the wells of the neighbourhood added one of the workmen who was standing by and he mentioned several in which the water had lately suddenly decreased and a miller affirmed that his mill had stopped for want of water,edgeworth-parents
phil,edgeworth-parents
,edgeworth-parents
francisco s father and mother more prudent than the generality of their neighbours went to the house of a relation at some miles distance from vesuvius and carried with them all their effects,edgeworth-parents
the count de flora and his lady who were at this time in the house ridiculed the fears of arthur and could not be prevailed upon to remove even as far as naples,edgeworth-parents
it is sufficient here to say that in the space of about five hours the wretched inhabitants of torre del greco saw their town utterly destroyed by the streams of burning lava which poured from the mountain,edgeworth-parents
but these unfortunate persons frequently found their houses had been pillaged by robbers who in these moments of general confusion enrich themselves with the spoils of their fellow creatures,edgeworth-parents
the first person he saw was arthur who with a face of terror said to him do you know what has happened,edgeworth-parents
no but it will inevitably be blown up,edgeworth-parents
francisco waited not to hear more but instantly without explaining his intentions to anyone set out for the count s villa and with a bucket of water in his hand crossed the beds of lava with which the house was encompassed when reaching the hall where the rockets and gunpowder were left he plunged them into the water and returned with them in safety over the lava yet warm under his feet,edgeworth-parents
brave young man,edgeworth-parents
bravissimo,edgeworth-parents
he remembered to have seen him before but when or where he could not recollect,edgeworth-parents
repeated francisco smiling i have shed but few tears,edgeworth-parents
the same said the improvisatore the same though in a better dress which i should not have thought would have made so much difference in your eyes though it makes all the difference between man and man in the eyes of the stupid vulgar,edgeworth-parents
my ode was to have been set to music and to have been performed at his villa near torre del greco if these troubles had not intervened,edgeworth-parents
i still amuse myself amongst the populace in my tattered garb late in the evenings and i shall sound your praises through naples in a poem i mean to recite on the late eruption of mount vesuvius,edgeworth-parents
these were his young companions who remembered him as a fruit seller amongst the little merchants,edgeworth-parents
a lad who held by his arm stopped suddenly on hearing the name of francisco which the people were repeating with so much enthusiasm,edgeworth-parents
not one word of the heroic action performed at the villa of the count de flora near torre del greco this morning by signor francisco,edgeworth-parents
what of signor francisco,edgeworth-parents
how pray is he likely to become rich enough to be a signor,edgeworth-parents
this man was one of the villains against whom the honest orator expressed such indignation,edgeworth-parents
,edgeworth-parents
and who is this francisco of whom you seem to stand in so much awe,edgeworth-parents
no said piedro that is not his nature,edgeworth-parents
no tyranny is so dreadful as that which is exercised by villains over their young accomplices who become their slaves,edgeworth-parents
piedro you look pale,edgeworth-parents
piedro when he was alone tried to collect his thoughts all his thoughts were full of horror,edgeworth-parents
excellent kind generous francisco,edgeworth-parents
his wretched father died some weeks before this time in a fit of intoxication,edgeworth-parents
it was at the jew s that he connected himself with this gang of robbers to whom he was now become an absolute slave,edgeworth-parents
at the moment piedro knocked at the back door the front shop was full of customers and the jew s boy whose office it was to attend to these signals let piedro in told him that none of his comrades were yet come and left him in a room by himself,edgeworth-parents
he longed to hear some noise and to mix with the living,edgeworth-parents
i am glad to part with all i have in this line of business,edgeworth-parents
i did not know that i fixed my eyes upon you i was thinking of my fireworks said the poor man simply,edgeworth-parents
a great while ago no wonder you have forgotten me said the man but i can recall the night to your recollection,edgeworth-parents
that lady though i did not know it till lately was the countess de flora,edgeworth-parents
the man s curiosity was excited and his suspicions of piedro were increased every moment by all the dark changes of his countenance,edgeworth-parents
this slight circumstance affected his terrified and superstitious mind more than all the rest,edgeworth-parents
you are going to the count de flora s are not you,edgeworth-parents
his villa is to be attacked this night by four well armed men,edgeworth-parents
the poor man who heard this confession escaped from piedro the moment he loosed his arm,edgeworth-parents
they waited much against arthur s inclination a considerable time for these sbirri,edgeworth-parents
arthur as soon as he perceived the flash of the piece pressed forward through all the apartments followed by the count s servants and the officers of justice,edgeworth-parents
take me to prison,edgeworth-parents
he was ordered to remain twelve months in solitary confinement,edgeworth-parents
now that you are able to go out said francisco s father to him you must come and look at my new house my dear son,edgeworth-parents
arthur would not accept of any present from him,edgeworth-parents
yes added francisco s father i think it is pretty plain that piedro the cunning has not managed quite so well as francisco the honest,edgeworth-parents
young hardy was educated by mr freeman a very excellent master at one of our rural sunday schools,edgeworth-parents
loveit and another boy called tarlton began to play a game of battledore and shuttlecock and a large party stood by to look on for they were the best players at battledore and shuttlecock in the school and this was a trial of skill between them,edgeworth-parents
resounded on all sides,edgeworth-parents
now i dare you all to play another game with me cried tarlton vauntingly and as he spoke he tossed the shuttlecock up with all his force with so much force that it went over the hedge and dropped into a lane which went close beside the field,edgeworth-parents
they stood on the top of the bank peeping over the hedge,edgeworth-parents
said tarlton why now what harm could it do,edgeworth-parents
but upon tarlton s repeating in a more insolent tone i ask you man what you re afraid of,edgeworth-parents
of doing wrong,edgeworth-parents
no matter what you meant why should you interfere with your wisdom and your meanings nobody thought of asking you to stir a step for us but we asked loveit because he s the best fellow in the world,edgeworth-parents
cried tarlton did you ever in your life see anybody look so silly hardy has him quite under his thumb he s so mortally afraid of parson prig that he dare not for the soul of him turn either of his eyes from the tip of his nose look how he squints,edgeworth-parents
whom do they call little panado,edgeworth-parents
no said hardy i can t go back and you d better not,edgeworth-parents
cried everybody eagerly,edgeworth-parents
well then just at the turn of the corner at the end of the lane as i was looking about for the shuttlecock i heard a great rustling somewhere near me and so i looked where it could come from and i saw in a nice little garden on the opposite side of the way a boy about as big as tarlton sitting in a great tree shaking the branches so i called to the boy to beg one but he said he could not give me one for that they were his grandfather s and just at that minute from behind a gooseberry bush up popped the uncle the grandfather poked his head out of the window so i ran off as fast as my legs would carry me though i heard him bawling after me all the way,edgeworth-parents
regardless of this confusion tarlton continued but before i say any more i hope we have no spies amongst us,edgeworth-parents
each boy gave his hand and his promise repeating stand by me and i ll stand by you,edgeworth-parents
you have n t heard it yet you may as well know your text before you begin preaching,edgeworth-parents
and he mechanically stretched out his hand which tarlton shook violently saying ay now that s right,edgeworth-parents
it is certain that weakness of mind is despised both by the good and the bad,edgeworth-parents
it was a moonlight night and after crossing the field and climbing the gate directed by loveit who now resolved to go through the affair with spirit they proceeded down the lane with rash yet fearful steps,edgeworth-parents
once as loveit was climbing the apple tree he thought he heard a door in the cottage open and earnestly begged his companions to desist and return home,edgeworth-parents
ah said he to himself how quietly he sleeps,edgeworth-parents
everyone was astonished that hardy with all his quickness and penetration had not yet discovered their proceedings but loveit could not help suspecting that he was not quite so ignorant as he appeared to be,edgeworth-parents
well said loveit to himself so i am abused after all and called a sneaking fellow for my pains that s rather hard to be sure when i ve got so little by the job,edgeworth-parents
nor was he in the least avaricious for though he was not rich he had enough to live upon because he had been very industrious in his youth and he was always very ready to part with the little he had,edgeworth-parents
let me see oh ay that will do i will borrow farmer kent s dog barker he ll keep them off i ll answer for it,edgeworth-parents
but the moment they had set their foot in the garden the dog started up and shaking the chain as he sprang forward barked with unremitting fury,edgeworth-parents
he ll break his chain and tear us to pieces cried tarlton and struck with terror he immediately threw down the basket he had brought with him and betook himself to flight with the greatest precipitation,edgeworth-parents
oh for god s sake stay for me one minute dear tarlton,edgeworth-parents
why could not you any of you stay one minute to help me,edgeworth-parents
i said tarlton had not i enough to do to take care of myself you blockhead,edgeworth-parents
strange,edgeworth-parents
tarlton was alarmed,edgeworth-parents
loveit gave his hand but gave it rather coldly,edgeworth-parents
well then come you know at the bottom we all love you and would do anything in the world for you,edgeworth-parents
after school in the evening as he was standing silently beside hardy who was ruling a sheet of paper for him tarlton in his brutal manner came up and seizing him by the arm cried come along with me loveit i ve something to say to you,edgeworth-parents
what is it you ve got to say to me,edgeworth-parents
ay we ll talk of that presently not yet when we get out of hearing,edgeworth-parents
yes,edgeworth-parents
what s that,edgeworth-parents
tom the servant boy tom got it for me and i m to give him sixpence,edgeworth-parents
is it poison,edgeworth-parents
nay but stay said tarlton catching hold of his arm stay i was only joking,edgeworth-parents
why you know i might not know for tom told me it s a thing that s often done,edgeworth-parents
i don t want to hear what he ll say cried loveit vehemently the dog will die in agonies in agonies,edgeworth-parents
well there s no harm done now cried tarlton in a hypocritical tone,edgeworth-parents
asked he in an inquiring manner fixing his eyes upon him,edgeworth-parents
oh he has certainly changed his mind,edgeworth-parents
they both went to the top of the stairs to call tom no one answered,edgeworth-parents
what are you doing there,edgeworth-parents
he s gone to do it,edgeworth-parents
how cruel,edgeworth-parents
returned hardy in that commanding tone which in moments of danger strong minds feel themselves entitled to assume towards weak ones,edgeworth-parents
they ll never forgive me,edgeworth-parents
i will not betray you trust to me said hardy and he left the room and loveit stood in amazement while in the meantime hardy in hopes of overtaking tom before the fate of the poor dog was decided ran with all possible speed across the meadow then down the lane,edgeworth-parents
what do you want,edgeworth-parents
sir upon my word i haven t,edgeworth-parents
the dog now alarmed by the voices began to bark outrageously,edgeworth-parents
never did hero retire with more satisfaction from a field of battle,edgeworth-parents
hardy obeyed without reply hardy,edgeworth-parents
will you please to do me the favour sir if it is not too much trouble to empty your pockets,edgeworth-parents
what next,edgeworth-parents
cried mr william power letting it drop out of his fingers you wretch,edgeworth-parents
cried he shaking him by the shoulder impatiently,edgeworth-parents
very well sir,edgeworth-parents
as i do now sir said hardy unmoved,edgeworth-parents
better and better,edgeworth-parents
come along with me young gentleman your time for pardon is past,edgeworth-parents
the conversation which had passed between hardy and mr power at the head of the stairs had been anxiously listened to but only a word or two here and there had been distinctly overheard,edgeworth-parents
how could you do so,edgeworth-parents
what a scrape you have brought us into loveit it s all your fault,edgeworth-parents
now for it,edgeworth-parents
they knelt down to prayers and the moment they rose mr william power laying his hand upon the table cried stand still gentlemen if you please,edgeworth-parents
i hope he has not told of me cried they,edgeworth-parents
his eye fell upon no one not even upon loveit who pulled him by the coat as he passed everyone felt almost afraid to breathe,edgeworth-parents
but i have something more to say to you sir then and a great deal more i promise you before i have done with you and then seizing him in a fury he was just going to give him a severe flogging when the schoolroom door opened and mr trueman appeared followed by an old man whom loveit immediately knew,edgeworth-parents
i told him you d not believe your own eyes,edgeworth-parents
i sir,edgeworth-parents
i am not a thief,edgeworth-parents
no sir i do not,edgeworth-parents
lord bless him,edgeworth-parents
no he cannot impose upon me i have a proof he is little prepared for said mr trueman producing the blue handkerchief in which the meat had been wrapped,edgeworth-parents
no sir,edgeworth-parents
i will begin with the eldest of you i will begin with hardy and flog you with my own hands till this handkerchief is owned,edgeworth-parents
hardy looked with a steady eye at the cane,edgeworth-parents
t,edgeworth-parents
said he appealing to hardy whose word he knew must be believed,edgeworth-parents
it s very hard i m to be flogged more than they,edgeworth-parents
if i had any hopes of him said mr trueman as he shut the door after him if i had any hopes of him i would have punished him but i have none,edgeworth-parents
not because you ask it said mr trueman to the guilty penitents though i should be glad to oblige you it wouldn t be just but there pointing to hardy there is one who has merited a reward the highest i can give him is that of pardoning his companions,edgeworth-parents
i will water it and take care of it with my own hands for your sake as long as i am able,edgeworth-parents
paul et virginie,edgeworth-parents
she was very kind to these poor children and worked hard at her spinning wheel and at her knitting to support herself and them,edgeworth-parents
the little boy and girl loved to stand beside the good natured old woman s spinning wheel when she was spinning and to talk to her,edgeworth-parents
the people who are in the carriages give you a halfpenny or a penny for doing this don t they,edgeworth-parents
and could not we bring them all to you,edgeworth-parents
a great many carriages happened to go by this day and the little girl received a great many halfpence,edgeworth-parents
it does not hurt me much grandmother and i ve thought of a good thing for to morrow,edgeworth-parents
look grandmamma look at my scotcher,edgeworth-parents
and i wish that as many chaises may go by to morrow as there did to day and that we may bring you as many halfpence grandmother said the little girl,edgeworth-parents
whispered little anne,edgeworth-parents
many carriages went by this day and paul and anne received a great many halfpence from the travellers,edgeworth-parents
paul had taken the halfpence out of his hat and he had put them into a hole in the high bank by the roadside and anne said she would not meddle with them and that she would wait till her brother liked to count them and paul said if you will stay and watch here i will go and gather some blackberries for you in the hedge in yonder field,edgeworth-parents
have not i waited long enough for to day paul,edgeworth-parents
paul as soon as they went up the hill followed with his scotcher first he scotched the wheels of one carriage then of another and anne was so much delighted with observing how well the scotcher stopped the wheels and how much better it was than stones that she forgot to go and hold her brother s hat to the travellers for halfpence till she was roused by the voice of a little rosy girl who was looking out of the window of one of the chaises,edgeworth-parents
but oh brother look at this,edgeworth-parents
i ll run to the fruit stall and ask the woman shall i,edgeworth-parents
why not so well as my grandmother perhaps but anne i can tell you that you must not talk yourself anne but you must listen to me quietly or else you won t understand what i am going to tell you for i can assure you that i don t think i quite understood it myself anne the first time my grandmother told it to me though i stood stock still listening my best,edgeworth-parents
but we could give some of them to my grandmother said anne,edgeworth-parents
something that she said she wanted very much last winter when she was so ill with the rheumatism something that she said yesterday when you were making her bed she wished she might be able to buy before next winter,edgeworth-parents
but paul how shall we buy a blanket,edgeworth-parents
you have seen a great many things at dunstable brother,edgeworth-parents
and you ll bring the blanket to me and i shall make the bed very neatly that will be all right all happy,edgeworth-parents
it will not be all right i m afraid for there is one thing we have neither of us thought of but that we ought to think about,edgeworth-parents
it was given to us and grandmother said all that was given to us to day was to be our own,edgeworth-parents
now if she gave you the guinea she must have given it to you by mistake,edgeworth-parents
paul thought this was excellent advice and he was not a silly boy who did not like to follow good advice,edgeworth-parents
those who threw it you gave it you by mistake i warrant and what i would have you do is to go to dunstable and try if you can at either of the inns find out the person who gave it to you,edgeworth-parents
i remember it was a dark green chaise with red wheels and i remember i read the innkeeper s name upon the chaise john nelson,edgeworth-parents
so anne and i will go to both the inns in dunstable and try to find out this chaise john nelson s,edgeworth-parents
cow,edgeworth-parents
there was a great noise and bustle,edgeworth-parents
said a waiter who almost ran over paul as he was crossing the yard in a great hurry to get some empty bottles from the bottle rack,edgeworth-parents
said one of the postillions,edgeworth-parents
no said paul we should like to give it back ourselves,edgeworth-parents
a man who was pushing his way in and carried in his hand a string of dead larks hung to a pole impatient at being stopped kicked down the straw basket and all its contents were thrown out,edgeworth-parents
we ll help you to pick them up if you will let us cried paul and anne and they immediately ran to her assistance,edgeworth-parents
i and my master came in that chaise,edgeworth-parents
pray mrs landlady cried this gentleman s servant addressing himself to the landlady who just then came out of a room where some company were at supper pray mrs landlady please to let me have roasted larks for my supper,edgeworth-parents
no bad hit was a sentence which the servant pronounced several times,edgeworth-parents
joe,edgeworth-parents
a trifle ma am said the basket woman,edgeworth-parents
the children gathered round her large pannier as it opened but they did not touch any of her things,edgeworth-parents
for powdering slippers miss interrupted the basket woman,edgeworth-parents
ah the guinea that you threw by mistake into the little girl s hat as we were coming up chalk hill,edgeworth-parents
a little boy and girl have just been here inquiring for a gentleman who gave them a guinea instead of a halfpenny by mistake and not five minutes ago i saw the boy give the guinea to a gentleman s servant who is there without and who said his master desired it should be returned to him,edgeworth-parents
paul and anne were speedily summoned and brought back by their friend the basket woman and anne the moment she saw the gentleman knew that he was the very person who smiled upon her who admired her brother s scotcher and who threw a handful of halfpence into the hat but she could not be certain she said that she received the guinea from him she only thought it most likely that she did,edgeworth-parents
i mean the master of the servant who received a guinea from this child,edgeworth-parents
the servant confounded and half intoxicated could only stammer out that he had more guineas than one about him and that he really did not know which it was,edgeworth-parents
in the same moment anne and paul exclaimed the thing we wish for the most in the world is a blanket for our grandmother,edgeworth-parents
we like to have something to do always if we could sir said paul but we are forced to be idle sometimes because grandmother has not always things for us to do that we can do well,edgeworth-parents
very much,edgeworth-parents
if i find that they are i will do something more for you,edgeworth-parents
your grandmother will sleep well upon this good blanket i hope said the gentleman as he gave it into paul s opened arms,edgeworth-parents

i could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this dark complexioned harpooneer,melville-moby_dick
i seed her reported in the offing this morning a three years voyage and a full ship,melville-moby_dick
no wonder then that they made a straight wake for the whale s mouth the bar when the wrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round,melville-moby_dick
he stood full six feet in height with noble shoulders and a chest like a coffer dam,melville-moby_dick
in a few minutes however he was missed by his shipmates and being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they raised a cry of bulkington,melville-moby_dick
no man prefers to sleep two in a bed,melville-moby_dick
to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin,melville-moby_dick
suppose now he should tumble in upon me at midnight how could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming,melville-moby_dick
but wait a bit skrimshander i ve got a carpenter s plane there in the bar wait i say and i ll make ye snug enough,melville-moby_dick
i now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too short but that could be mended with a chair,melville-moby_dick
it seemed no bad idea but upon second thoughts i dismissed it,melville-moby_dick
but though the other boarders kept coming in by ones twos and threes and going to bed yet no sign of my harpooneer,melville-moby_dick
no he answered generally he s an early bird airley to bed and airley to rise yes he s the bird what catches the worm,melville-moby_dick
that s precisely it said the landlord and i told him he couldn t sell it here the market s overstocked,melville-moby_dick
may be not taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick but i rayther guess you ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a slanderin his head,melville-moby_dick
landlord said i going up to him as cool as mt,melville-moby_dick
i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him,melville-moby_dick
this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling me but at the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators,melville-moby_dick
why afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it,melville-moby_dick
i considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and i was ushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast,melville-moby_dick
i then glanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four walls and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale,melville-moby_dick
i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an indian moccasin,melville-moby_dick
i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck,melville-moby_dick
whether that mattress was stuffed with corn cobs or broken crockery there is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time,melville-moby_dick
i was all eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bag s mouth,melville-moby_dick
yes it s just as i thought he s a terrible bedfellow he s been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is just from the surgeon,melville-moby_dick
i concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure,melville-moby_dick
however i had never been in the south seas and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin,melville-moby_dick
there was no hair on his head none to speak of at least nothing but a small scalp knot twisted up on his forehead,melville-moby_dick
ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger i confess i was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night,melville-moby_dick
it was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south seas and so landed in this christian country,melville-moby_dick
but there was no time for shuddering for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen,melville-moby_dick
the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty so that i thought this fire place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol,melville-moby_dick
all these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee who seemed to be praying in a sing song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner,melville-moby_dick
the next moment the light was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang into bed with me,melville-moby_dick
he at last said you no speak e dam me i kill e and so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark,melville-moby_dick
coffin,melville-moby_dick
again growled the cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire,melville-moby_dick
queequeg look here you sabbee me i sabbee you this man sleepe you you sabbee,melville-moby_dick
for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean comely looking cannibal,melville-moby_dick
it s dangerous,melville-moby_dick
chapter 4,melville-moby_dick
indeed partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke i could hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hues together and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that queequeg was hugging me,melville-moby_dick
i had been cutting up some caper or other i think it was trying to crawl up the chimney as i had seen a little sweep do a few days previous and my stepmother who somehow or other was all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperless my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed though it was only two o clock in the afternoon of the 21st june the longest day in the year in our hemisphere,melville-moby_dick
the small of my back ached to think of it,melville-moby_dick
at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly waking from it half steeped in dreams i opened my eyes and the before sun lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness,melville-moby_dick
nay to this very hour i often puzzle myself with it,melville-moby_dick
but his only answer was a snore,melville-moby_dick
at length by dint of much wriggling and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in extracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed stiff as a pike staff looking at me and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him,melville-moby_dick
nevertheless a man like queequeg you don t see every day he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding,melville-moby_dick
his education was not yet completed,melville-moby_dick
he complied and then proceeded to wash himself,melville-moby_dick
afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept,melville-moby_dick
i cherished no malice towards him though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow,melville-moby_dick
they were nearly all whalemen chief mates and second mates and third mates and sea carpenters and sea coopers and sea blacksmiths and harpooneers and ship keepers a brown and brawny company with bosky beards an unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns,melville-moby_dick
but who could show a cheek like queequeg,melville-moby_dick
not always though ledyard the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor,melville-moby_dick
yes here were a set of sea dogs many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas entire strangers to them and duelled them dead without winking and yet here they sat at a social breakfast table all of the same calling all of kindred tastes looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains,melville-moby_dick
but that was certainly very coolly done by him and every one knows that in most people s estimation to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly,melville-moby_dick
if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of new bedford,melville-moby_dick
in these last mentioned haunts you see only sailors but in new bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners savages outright many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh,melville-moby_dick
many are as green as the green mountains whence they came,melville-moby_dick
here comes another with a sou wester and a bombazine cloak,melville-moby_dick
how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale when thou art driven straps buttons and all down the throat of the tempest,melville-moby_dick
as it is parts of her back country are enough to frighten one they look so bony,melville-moby_dick
whence came they,melville-moby_dick
can herr alexander perform a feat like that,melville-moby_dick
so omnipotent is art which in many a district of new bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation s final day,melville-moby_dick
the chapel,melville-moby_dick
wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin i fought my way against the stubborn storm,melville-moby_dick
three of them ran something like the following but i do not pretend to quote,melville-moby_dick
this marble is here placed by their surviving shipmates,melville-moby_dick
affected by the solemnity of the scene there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance,melville-moby_dick
what bitter blanks in those black bordered marbles which cover no ashes,melville-moby_dick
all these things are not without their meanings,melville-moby_dick
delightful inducements to embark fine chance for promotion it seems aye a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet,melville-moby_dick
methinks that in looking at things spiritual we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air,melville-moby_dick
the pulpit,melville-moby_dick
no one having previously heard his history could for the first time behold father mapple without the utmost interest because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led,melville-moby_dick
halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man ropes father mapple cast a look upwards and then with a truly sailor like but still reverential dexterity hand over hand mounted the steps as if ascending the main top of his vessel,melville-moby_dick
father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage,melville-moby_dick
between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers,melville-moby_dick
its panelled front was in the likeness of a ship s bluff bows and the holy bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work fashioned after a ship s fiddle headed beak,melville-moby_dick
chapter 9,melville-moby_dick
midships,melville-moby_dick
the ribs and terrors in the whale arched over me a dismal gloom while all god s sun lit waves rolled by and lift me deepening down to doom,melville-moby_dick
nearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the howling of the storm,melville-moby_dick
what a noble thing is that canticle in the fish s belly,melville-moby_dick
as sinful men it is a lesson to us all because it is a story of the sin hard heartedness suddenly awakened fears the swift punishment repentance prayers and finally the deliverance and joy of jonah,melville-moby_dick
he thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where god does not reign but only the captains of this earth,melville-moby_dick
and where is cadiz shipmates,melville-moby_dick
oh,melville-moby_dick
at last after much dodging search he finds the tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo and as he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the stranger s evil eye,melville-moby_dick
he reads and looks from jonah to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round jonah prepared to lay their hands upon him,melville-moby_dick
cries the captain at his busy desk hurriedly making out his papers for the customs who s there,melville-moby_dick
i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon sail ye sir,melville-moby_dick
ha,melville-moby_dick
and taken with the context this is full of meaning,melville-moby_dick
then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold,melville-moby_dick
thou lookest like it says the captain there s thy room,melville-moby_dick
then in that contracted hole sunk too beneath the ship s water line jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels wards,melville-moby_dick
oh,melville-moby_dick
that ship my friends was the first of recorded smugglers,melville-moby_dick
he sees no black sky and raging sea feels not the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him,melville-moby_dick
but at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks,melville-moby_dick
the sailors mark him more and more certain grow their suspicions of him and at last fully to test the truth by referring the whole matter to high heaven they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them,melville-moby_dick
what people,melville-moby_dick
aye well mightest thou fear the lord god then,melville-moby_dick
he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shoots to all his ivory teeth like so many white bolts upon his prison,melville-moby_dick
he leaves all his deliverance to god contenting himself with this that spite of all his pains and pangs he will still look towards his holy temple,melville-moby_dick
while he was speaking these words the howling of the shrieking slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who when describing jonah s sea storm seemed tossed by a storm himself,melville-moby_dick
i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that jonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more to me for i am a greater sinner than ye,melville-moby_dick
yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet out of the belly of hell when the whale grounded upon the ocean s utmost bones even then god heard the engulphed repenting prophet when he cried,melville-moby_dick
this shipmates this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot of the living god who slights it,melville-moby_dick
woe to him who in this world courts not dishonour,melville-moby_dick
on the starboard hand of every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight than the bottom of the woe is deep,melville-moby_dick
delight top gallant delight is to him who acknowledges no law or lord but the lord his god and is only a patriot to heaven,melville-moby_dick
he said no more but slowly waving a benediction covered his face with his hands and so remained kneeling till all the people had departed and he was left alone in the place,melville-moby_dick
but being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth page as i fancied stopping a moment looking vacantly around him and giving utterance to a long drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment,melville-moby_dick
through all his unearthly tattooings i thought i saw the traces of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eyes fiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils,melville-moby_dick
it had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows which were likewise very projecting like two long promontories thickly wooded on top,melville-moby_dick
at first they are overawing their calm self collectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom,melville-moby_dick
surely this was a touch of fine philosophy though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that,melville-moby_dick
no more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world,melville-moby_dick
i ll try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy,melville-moby_dick
thus i soon engaged his interest and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town,melville-moby_dick
in a countryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply,melville-moby_dick
he then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removed the paper fireboard,melville-moby_dick
thought i,melville-moby_dick
now queequeg is my fellow man,melville-moby_dick
but we did not go to sleep without some little chat,melville-moby_dick
nightgown,melville-moby_dick
nothing exists in itself,melville-moby_dick
then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal,melville-moby_dick
be it said that though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them,melville-moby_dick
whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes i know not but he now spoke of his native island and eager to hear his history i begged him to go on and tell it,melville-moby_dick
queequeg was a native of rokovoko an island far away to the west and south,melville-moby_dick
a sag harbor ship visited his father s bay and queequeg sought a passage to christian lands,melville-moby_dick
hiding his canoe still afloat among these thickets with its prow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the ship was gliding by like a flash he darted out gained her side with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up the chains and throwing himself at full length upon the deck grappled a ring bolt there and swore not to let it go though hacked in pieces,melville-moby_dick
but like czar peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen,melville-moby_dick
thought he it s a wicked world in all meridians i ll die a pagan,melville-moby_dick
but by and by he said he would return as soon as he felt himself baptized again,melville-moby_dick
upon this i told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my intention to sail out of nantucket as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from,melville-moby_dick
wheelbarrow,melville-moby_dick
but we heeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs,melville-moby_dick
it was in sag harbor,melville-moby_dick
upon this he told me another story,melville-moby_dick
seeing himself placed next the priest and noting the ceremony and thinking himself being captain of a ship as having plain precedence over a mere island king especially in the king s own house the captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl taking it i suppose for a huge finger glass,melville-moby_dick
huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves and side by side the world wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch all betokening that new cruises were on the start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only begins a second and a second ended only begins a third and so on for ever and for aye,melville-moby_dick
his dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed teeth,melville-moby_dick
queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back,melville-moby_dick
yelled the bumpkin running towards that officer capting capting here s the devil,melville-moby_dick
he say said i that you came near kill e that man there pointing to the still shivering greenhorn,melville-moby_dick
the prodigious strain upon the main sail had parted the weather sheet and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck,melville-moby_dick
the schooner was run into the wind and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat queequeg stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap,melville-moby_dick
a few minutes more and he rose again one arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form,melville-moby_dick
was there ever such unconsciousness,melville-moby_dick
nantucket,melville-moby_dick
look at it a mere hillock and elbow of sand all beach without a background,melville-moby_dick
thus goes the legend,melville-moby_dick
what wonder then that these nantucketers born on a beach should take to the sea for a livelihood,melville-moby_dick
for the sea is his he owns it as emperors own empires other seamen having but a right of way through it,melville-moby_dick
for years he knows not the land so that when he comes to it at last it smells like another world more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman,melville-moby_dick
the landlord of the spouter inn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of the try pots whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all nantucket and moreover he had assured us that cousin hosea as he called him was famous for his chowders,melville-moby_dick
the horns of the cross trees were sawed off on the other side so that this old top mast looked not a little like a gallows,melville-moby_dick
and a pair of prodigious black pots too,melville-moby_dick
there s mrs,melville-moby_dick
said i with much politeness,melville-moby_dick
hussey,melville-moby_dick
however a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us,melville-moby_dick
our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage and in particular queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him and the chowder being surpassingly excellent we despatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of mrs hussey s clam and cod announcement i thought i would try a little experiment,melville-moby_dick
but look queequeg ain t that a live eel in your bowl,melville-moby_dick
mrs hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey had his account books bound in superior old shark skin,melville-moby_dick
because it s dangerous says she,melville-moby_dick
chapter 16,melville-moby_dick
now this plan of queequeg s or rather yojo s touching the selection of our craft i did not like that plan at all,melville-moby_dick
devil dam i do not know the origin of tit bit is obvious pequod you will no doubt remember was the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians now extinct as the ancient medes,melville-moby_dick
her venerable bows looked bearded,melville-moby_dick
she was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory,melville-moby_dick
scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported there a tiller and that tiller was in one mass curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe,melville-moby_dick
it seemed only a temporary erection used in port,melville-moby_dick
he was seated on an old fashioned oaken chair wriggling all over with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed,melville-moby_dick
supposing it be the captain of the pequod what dost thou want of him,melville-moby_dick
no sir i never have,melville-moby_dick
talk not that lingo to me,melville-moby_dick
man what makes thee want to go a whaling eh it looks a little suspicious don t it eh hast not been a pirate hast thou didst not rob thy last captain didst thou dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea,melville-moby_dick
well sir i want to see what whaling is,melville-moby_dick
aye aye i thought so,melville-moby_dick
it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted out for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew,melville-moby_dick
was the other one lost by a whale,melville-moby_dick
sure ye ve been to sea before now sure of that,melville-moby_dick
i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel inclined for it,melville-moby_dick
i am sir if it should be positively indispensable to do so not to be got rid of that is which i don t take to be the fact,melville-moby_dick
well then just step forward there and take a peep over the weather bow and then back to me and tell me what ye see there,melville-moby_dick
well what s the report,melville-moby_dick
can t ye see the world where you stand,melville-moby_dick
seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure,melville-moby_dick
they are fighting quakers they are quakers with a vengeance,melville-moby_dick
be sure of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease,melville-moby_dick
though refusing from conscientious scruples to bear arms against land invaders yet himself had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed yet had he in his straight bodied coat spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore,melville-moby_dick
they told me in nantucket though it certainly seems a curious story that when he sailed the old categut whaleman his crew upon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out,melville-moby_dick
his own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character,melville-moby_dick
bildad cried captain peleg at it again bildad eh,melville-moby_dick
dost thee,melville-moby_dick
he ll do said bildad eyeing me and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible,melville-moby_dick
i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages but all hands including the captain received certain shares of the profits called lays and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship s company,melville-moby_dick
upon the whole i thought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have been surprised had i been offered the 200th considering i was of a broad shouldered make,melville-moby_dick
thou knowest best was the sepulchral reply the seven hundred and seventy seventh wouldn t be too much would it where moth and rust do corrupt but lay,melville-moby_dick
why blast your eyes bildad cried peleg thou dost not want to swindle this young man,melville-moby_dick
bildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said captain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship widows and orphans many of them and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans,melville-moby_dick
captain peleg said bildad steadily thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water or ten fathoms i can t tell but as thou art still an impenitent man captain peleg i greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit captain peleg,melville-moby_dick
flukes and flames,melville-moby_dick
but to my astonishment he sat down again on the transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing,melville-moby_dick
bildad thou used to be good at sharpening a lance mend that pen will ye,melville-moby_dick
captain peleg said i i have a friend with me who wants to ship too shall i bring him down to morrow,melville-moby_dick
oh,melville-moby_dick
well bring him along then,melville-moby_dick
and what dost thou want of captain ahab,melville-moby_dick
in fact he ain t sick but no he isn t well either,melville-moby_dick
mark ye be forewarned ahab s above the common ahab s been in colleges as well as mong the cannibals been used to deeper wonders than the waves fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales,melville-moby_dick
and a very vile one,melville-moby_dick
captain ahab did not name himself,melville-moby_dick
it s a lie,melville-moby_dick
so good bye to thee and wrong not captain ahab because he happens to have a wicked name,melville-moby_dick
and somehow at the time i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i don t know what unless it was the cruel loss of his leg,melville-moby_dick
the ramadan,melville-moby_dick
all our arguing with him would not avail let him be i say and heaven have mercy on us all presbyterians and pagans alike for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and sadly need mending,melville-moby_dick
why don t you speak,melville-moby_dick
i looked through the key hole but the door opening into an odd corner of the room the key hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one,melville-moby_dick
all still,melville-moby_dick
la,melville-moby_dick
la,melville-moby_dick
and with these cries she ran towards the kitchen i following,melville-moby_dick
he s had a stroke depend upon it,melville-moby_dick
look here said the landlady quickly putting down the vinegar cruet so as to have one hand free look here are you talking about prying open any of my doors,melville-moby_dick
unconsciously clapping the vinegar cruet to one side of her nose she ruminated for an instant then exclaimed no,melville-moby_dick
has the poor lad a sister,melville-moby_dick
you young man avast there,melville-moby_dick
putting her hand in her side pocket here s a key that ll fit i guess let s see,melville-moby_dick
there sat queequeg altogether cool and self collected right in the middle of the room squatting on his hams and holding yojo on top of his head,melville-moby_dick
but all we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost felt like pushing him over so as to change his position for it was almost intolerable it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained especially as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours going too without his regular meals,melville-moby_dick
it must be so yes it s part of his creed i suppose well then let him rest he ll get up sooner or later no doubt,melville-moby_dick
i began to grow vexed with him it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room holding a piece of wood on his head,melville-moby_dick
but previous to turning in i took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him as it promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on,melville-moby_dick
but as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joints but with a cheerful look limped towards me where i lay pressed his forehead again against mine and said his ramadan was over,melville-moby_dick
i then went on beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions and coming down to the various religions of the present time during which time i labored to show queequeg that all these lents ramadans and prolonged ham squattings in cold cheerless rooms were stark nonsense bad for the health useless for the soul opposed in short to the obvious laws of hygiene and common sense,melville-moby_dick
i then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take it in,melville-moby_dick
after all i do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon queequeg,melville-moby_dick
his mark,melville-moby_dick
yes said captain bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head from behind peleg s out of the wigwam,melville-moby_dick
first congregational church cried bildad what,melville-moby_dick
no said peleg and he hasn t been baptized right either or it would have washed some of that devil s blue off his face,melville-moby_dick
young man said bildad sternly thou art skylarking with me explain thyself thou young hittite,melville-moby_dick
splice thou mean st splice hands cried peleg drawing nearer,melville-moby_dick
tell quohog to step along,melville-moby_dick
without saying a word queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whale boats hanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his harpoon cried out in some such way as this,melville-moby_dick
now said queequeg quietly hauling in the line spos ee him whale e eye why dad whale dead,melville-moby_dick
so down we went into the cabin and to my great joy queequeg was soon enrolled among the same ship s company to which i myself belonged,melville-moby_dick
quohog,melville-moby_dick
steer clear of the fiery pit,melville-moby_dick
he got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he shrinked and sheered away from whales for fear of after claps in case he got stove and went to davy jones,melville-moby_dick
tell me when this same pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on japan that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab did st thou not think of death and the judgment then,melville-moby_dick
what,melville-moby_dick
life was what captain ahab and i was thinking of and how to save all hands how to rig jury masts how to get into the nearest port that was what i was thinking of,melville-moby_dick
the prophet,melville-moby_dick
have ye shipped in her,melville-moby_dick
anything down there about your souls,melville-moby_dick
what are you jabbering about shipmate,melville-moby_dick
cried the stranger,melville-moby_dick
what,melville-moby_dick
he s sick they say but is getting better and will be all right again before long,melville-moby_dick
what did they tell you about him,melville-moby_dick
step and growl growl and go that s the word with captain ahab,melville-moby_dick
no i don t think ye did how could ye,melville-moby_dick
my friend said i what all this gibberish of yours is about i don t know and i don t much care for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head,melville-moby_dick
names down on the papers,melville-moby_dick
and it s said very well and i like to hear a chap talk up that way you are just the man for him the likes of ye,melville-moby_dick
it is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him,melville-moby_dick
elijah,melville-moby_dick
he did and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine,melville-moby_dick
chapter 20,melville-moby_dick
on the day following queequeg s signing the articles word was given at all the inns where the ship s company were stopping that their chests must be on board before night for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing,melville-moby_dick
just so with whaling which necessitates a three years housekeeping upon the wide ocean far from all grocers costermongers doctors bakers and bankers,melville-moby_dick
but as before hinted for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things both large and small,melville-moby_dick
but it was startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming on board as she did the last day with a long oil ladle in one hand and a still longer whaling lance in the other,melville-moby_dick
to these questions they would answer that he was getting better and better and was expected aboard every day meantime the two captains peleg and bildad could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage,melville-moby_dick
at last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail,melville-moby_dick
there are some sailors running ahead there if i see right said i to queequeg it can t be shadows she s off by sunrise i guess come on,melville-moby_dick
hands off will you said i,melville-moby_dick
no no no i wasn t aware of that said elijah slowly and wonderingly looking from me to queequeg with the most unaccountable glances,melville-moby_dick
he s cracked queequeg said i come on,melville-moby_dick
struck by this plain matter of fact question i answered saying yes i thought i did see four or five men but it was too dim to be sure,melville-moby_dick
morning to ye,melville-moby_dick
good bye to ye,melville-moby_dick
going forward to the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open,melville-moby_dick
said i looking dubiously at the sleeper,melville-moby_dick
queequeg don t sit there said i,melville-moby_dick
very benevolent countenance then but how hard he breathes he s heaving himself get off queequeg you are heavy it s grinding the face of the poor,melville-moby_dick
i sat at the feet,melville-moby_dick
what s that for queequeg,melville-moby_dick
he breathed with a sort of muffledness then seemed troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then sat up and rubbed his eyes,melville-moby_dick
she sails to day,melville-moby_dick
holloa,melville-moby_dick
soon the crew came on board in twos and threes the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were actively engaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board,melville-moby_dick
now mr starbuck are you sure everything is right,melville-moby_dick
how now,melville-moby_dick
and all this seemed natural enough especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table having a farewell merry making with their shore friends before they quit the ship for good with the pilot,melville-moby_dick
strike the tent there,melville-moby_dick
was the next command and the crew sprang for the handspikes,melville-moby_dick
i almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily i paused on my handspike and told queequeg to do the same thinking of the perils we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot,melville-moby_dick
spring thou sheep head spring and break thy backbone,melville-moby_dick
and so saying he moved along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while imperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody,melville-moby_dick
lank bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon as the old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the shivering frost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady notes were heard,melville-moby_dick
spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket there was yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store and meads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer,melville-moby_dick
as for peleg himself he took it more like a philosopher but for all his philosophy there was a tear twinkling in his eye when the lantern came too near,melville-moby_dick
stand by to come close alongside now,melville-moby_dick
i hope ye ll have fine weather now so that captain ahab may soon be moving among ye a pleasant sun is all he needs and ye ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go,melville-moby_dick
mr starbuck mind that cooper don t waste the spare staves,melville-moby_dick
if ye touch at the islands mr flask beware of fornication,melville-moby_dick
and with that peleg hurried him over the side and both dropt into the boat,melville-moby_dick
when on that shivering winter s night the pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves who should i see standing at her helm but bulkington,melville-moby_dick
the port would fain give succor the port is pitiful in the port is safety comfort hearthstone supper warm blankets friends all that s kind to our mortalities,melville-moby_dick
but as in landlessness alone resides highest truth shoreless indefinite as god so better is it to perish in that howling infinite than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee even if that were safety,melville-moby_dick
take heart take heart o bulkington,melville-moby_dick
as queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit therefore i am all anxiety to convince ye ye landsmen of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales,melville-moby_dick
butchers we are that is true,melville-moby_dick
for what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of god,melville-moby_dick
why did louis xvi,melville-moby_dick
how comes all this if there be not something puissant in whaling,melville-moby_dick
let a handful suffice,melville-moby_dick
for in their succourless empty handedness they in the heathenish sharked waters and by the beaches of unrecorded javelin islands battled with virgin wonders and terrors that cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared,melville-moby_dick
until the whale fishery rounded cape horn no commerce but colonial scarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between europe and the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacific coast,melville-moby_dick
moreover in the infancy of the first australian settlement the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters,melville-moby_dick
the whale no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler,melville-moby_dick
and who pronounced our glowing eulogy in parliament,melville-moby_dick
the grandmother of benjamin franklin was mary morrel afterwards by marriage mary folger one of the old settlers of nantucket and the ancestress to a long line of folgers and harpooneers all kith and kin to noble benjamin this day darting the barbed iron from one side of the world to the other,melville-moby_dick
,melville-moby_dick
,melville-moby_dick
cetus is a constellation in the south,melville-moby_dick
i account that man more honourable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns,melville-moby_dick
in behalf of the dignity of whaling i would fain advance naught but substantiated facts,melville-moby_dick
certain i am however that a king s head is solemnly oiled at his coronation even as a head of salad,melville-moby_dick
but the only thing to be considered here is this what kind of oil is used at coronations,melville-moby_dick
chapter 26,melville-moby_dick
he must have been born in some time of general drought and famine or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous,melville-moby_dick
his pure tight skin was an excellent fit and closely wrapped up in it and embalmed with inner health and strength like a revivified egyptian this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come and to endure always as now for be it polar snow or torrid sun like a patent chronometer his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates,melville-moby_dick
outward portents and inward presentiments were his,melville-moby_dick
but we shall ere long see what that word careful precisely means when used by a man like stubb or almost any other whale hunter,melville-moby_dick
what doom was his own father s,melville-moby_dick
but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete abasement of poor starbuck s fortitude scarce might i have the heart to write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose the fall of valour in the soul,melville-moby_dick
thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike that democratic dignity which on all hands radiates without end from god himself,melville-moby_dick
bear me out in it thou great democratic god,melville-moby_dick
stubb was the second mate,melville-moby_dick
when close to the whale in the very death lock of the fight he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off handedly as a whistling tinker his hammer,melville-moby_dick
what perhaps with other things made stubb such an easy going unfearing man so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlars all bowed to the ground with their packs what helped to bring about that almost impious good humor of his that thing must have been his pipe,melville-moby_dick
i say this continual smoking must have been one cause at least of his peculiar disposition for every one knows that this earthly air whether ashore or afloat is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it and as in time of the cholera some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths so likewise against all mortal tribulations stubb s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent,melville-moby_dick
as a carpenter s nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails so mankind may be similarly divided,melville-moby_dick
in that grand order of battle in which captain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales these three headsmen were as captains of companies,melville-moby_dick
next was tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerly promontory of martha s vineyard where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men which has long supplied the neighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers,melville-moby_dick
tashtego was stubb the second mate s squire,melville-moby_dick
there was a corporeal humility in looking up at him and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress,melville-moby_dick
no small number of these whaling seamen belong to the azores where the outward bound nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores,melville-moby_dick
yet now federated along one keel what a set these isolatoes were,melville-moby_dick
on the grim pequod s forecastle ye shall ere long see him beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternal time when sent for to the great quarter deck on high he was bid strike in with angels and beat his tambourine in glory called a coward here hailed a hero there,melville-moby_dick
yes their supreme lord and dictator was there though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin,melville-moby_dick
for though the harpooneers with the great body of the crew were a far more barbaric heathenish and motley set than any of the tame merchant ship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with still i ascribed this and rightly ascribed it to the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation in which i had so abandonedly embarked,melville-moby_dick
reality outran apprehension captain ahab stood upon his quarter deck,melville-moby_dick
it resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it and without wrenching a single twig peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running off into the soil leaving the tree still greenly alive but branded,melville-moby_dick
nevertheless the old sea traditions the immemorial credulities popularly invested this old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment,melville-moby_dick
he has a quiver of em,melville-moby_dick
not a word he spoke nor did his officers say aught to him though by all their minutest gestures and expressions they plainly showed the uneasy if not painful consciousness of being under a troubled master eye,melville-moby_dick
and by and by it came to pass that he was almost continually in the air but as yet for all that he said or perceptibly did on the at last sunny deck he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast,melville-moby_dick

for sleeping man twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights,melville-moby_dick
among sea commanders the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the night cloaked deck,melville-moby_dick
but once the mood was on him too deep for common regardings and as with heavy lumber like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast stubb the old second mate came up from below with a certain unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that if captain ahab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could say nay but there might be some way of muffling the noise hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow and the insertion into it of the ivory heel,melville-moby_dick
below to thy nightly grave where such as ye sleep between shrouds to use ye to the filling one at last down dog and kennel,melville-moby_dick
then be called ten times a donkey and a mule and an ass and begone or i ll clear the world of thee,melville-moby_dick
yes that was the thought coming up in me but it would be the first time i ever did pray,melville-moby_dick
he aint in his bed now either more than three hours out of the twenty four and he don t sleep then,melville-moby_dick
he s full of riddles i wonder what he goes into the after hold for every night as dough boy tells me he suspects what s that for i should like to know,melville-moby_dick
and now that i think of it that s about the first thing babies do and that s a sort of queer too,melville-moby_dick
didn t he call me a dog,melville-moby_dick
it flashed like a bleached bone,melville-moby_dick
how,melville-moby_dick
lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck he sat and smoked,melville-moby_dick
how now he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube this smoking no longer soothes,melville-moby_dick
this thing that is meant for sereneness to send up mild white vapours among mild white hairs not among torn iron grey locks like mine,melville-moby_dick
chapter 31,melville-moby_dick
and then presto,melville-moby_dick
and there s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump,melville-moby_dick
besides thinks i look at it once why the end of it the foot part what a small sort of end it is whereas if a broad footed farmer kicked me there s a devilish broad insult,melville-moby_dick
says he,melville-moby_dick
what am i about,melville-moby_dick
says i on second thoughts i guess i won t kick you old fellow,melville-moby_dick
look ye here says he let s argue the insult,melville-moby_dick
well then says he wise stubb what have you to complain of,melville-moby_dick
listen wise stubb,melville-moby_dick
i snored rolled over and there i was in my hammock,melville-moby_dick
d ye see ahab standing there sideways looking over the stern,melville-moby_dick
mast head there,melville-moby_dick
ain t there a small drop of something queer about that eh,melville-moby_dick
but mum he comes this way,melville-moby_dick
it is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera that i would now fain put before you,melville-moby_dick
it is not my intention were it in my power to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal sperm whale says surgeon beale a d 1839,melville-moby_dick
thus speak of the whale the great cuvier and john hunter and lesson those lights of zoology and anatomy,melville-moby_dick
but to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written the above cited extracts will show,melville-moby_dick
and here be it said that the greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas,melville-moby_dick
this is charing cross hear ye,melville-moby_dick
as yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic lives not complete in any literature,melville-moby_dick
i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species or in this place at least to much of any description,melville-moby_dick
what am i that i should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan,melville-moby_dick
there are some preliminaries to settle,melville-moby_dick
i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley coffin of nantucket both messmates of mine in a certain voyage and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient,melville-moby_dick
but in brief they are these lungs and warm blood whereas all other fish are lungless and cold blooded,melville-moby_dick
a walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is not a fish because he is amphibious,melville-moby_dick
hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground plan of cetology,melville-moby_dick

the hump backed whale v the razor back whale vi,melville-moby_dick
he is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globe the most formidable of all whales to encounter the most majestic in aspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce he being the only creature from which that valuable substance spermaceti is obtained,melville-moby_dick
it was the idea also that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses,melville-moby_dick
book i,melville-moby_dick
there is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised,melville-moby_dick
but they precisely agree in all their grand features nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction,melville-moby_dick
fin back under this head i reckon a monster which by the various names of fin back tall spout and long john has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the atlantic in the new york packet tracks,melville-moby_dick
even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible this isolated fin will at times be seen plainly projecting from the surface,melville-moby_dick
very shy always going solitary unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming as to defy all present pursuit from man this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cain of his race bearing for his mark that style upon his back,melville-moby_dick
how then,melville-moby_dick
in various sorts of whales they form such irregular combinations or in the case of any one of them detached such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis,melville-moby_dick
and if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated,melville-moby_dick
book i,melville-moby_dick
at any rate the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one,melville-moby_dick
folio chapter v,melville-moby_dick
let him go,melville-moby_dick
he is seldom seen at least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance,melville-moby_dick
thus ends book i,melville-moby_dick
why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain,melville-moby_dick
but possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan most naturalists have recognised him for one,melville-moby_dick
octavo chapter ii,melville-moby_dick
his voracity is well known and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards he carries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face,melville-moby_dick
though their blubber is very thin some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil,melville-moby_dick
strictly speaking this horn is but a lengthened tusk growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal,melville-moby_dick
but you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct,melville-moby_dick
it was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn,melville-moby_dick
his oil is very superior clear and fine but there is little of it and he is seldom hunted,melville-moby_dick
from what i have seen of him at a distance i should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus,melville-moby_dick
exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale on the ground of its indistinctness,melville-moby_dick
he mounts the folio whale s back and as he swims he works his passage by flogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process,melville-moby_dick
duodecimo,melville-moby_dick
the algerine porpoise,melville-moby_dick
a spouting fish with a horizontal tail,melville-moby_dick
i call him thus because he always swims in hilarious shoals which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a fourth of july crowd,melville-moby_dick
if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish then heaven help ye the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye,melville-moby_dick
porpoise meat is good eating you know,melville-moby_dick
duodecimo chapter ii,melville-moby_dick
provoke him and he will buckle to a shark,melville-moby_dick
the only english name by which he has hitherto been designated is that of the fishers right whale porpoise from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio,melville-moby_dick
the white comprises part of his head and the whole of his mouth which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal bag,melville-moby_dick
but there are a rabble of uncertain fugitive half fabulous whales which as an american whaleman i know by reputation but not personally,melville-moby_dick
finally it was stated at the outset that this system would not be here and at once perfected,melville-moby_dick
this whole book is but a draught nay but the draught of a draught,melville-moby_dick
the large importance attached to the harpooneer s vocation is evinced by the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery two centuries and more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain but was divided between him and an officer called the specksynder,melville-moby_dick
nevertheless as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat but under certain circumstances night watches on a whaling ground the command of the ship s deck is also his therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior though always by them familiarly regarded as their social equal,melville-moby_dick
indeed many are the nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple and not the shabbiest of pilot cloth,melville-moby_dick
this it is that for ever keeps god s true princes of the empire from the world s hustings and leaves the highest honours that this air can give to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass,melville-moby_dick
oh ahab,melville-moby_dick
from his complete inattention to the tidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial,melville-moby_dick
but ere stepping into the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and then independent hilarious little flask enters king ahab s presence in the character of abjectus or the slave,melville-moby_dick
to have been belshazzar king of babylon and to have been belshazzar not haughtily but courteously therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur,melville-moby_dick
over his ivory inlaid table ahab presided like a mute maned sea lion on the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs,melville-moby_dick
no,melville-moby_dick
his were the shinbones of the saline beef his would have been the drumsticks,melville-moby_dick
whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him on account of its clotting his clear sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on so long a voyage in such marketless waters butter was at a premium and therefore was not for him a subaltern however it was flask alas,melville-moby_dick
for hereby flask s dinner was badly jammed in point of time,melville-moby_dick
peace and satisfaction thought flask have for ever departed from my stomach,melville-moby_dick
after their departure taking place in inverted order to their arrival the canvas cloth was cleared or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward,melville-moby_dick
they dined like lords they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loading with spices,melville-moby_dick
and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages dough boy s whole life was one continual lip quiver,melville-moby_dick
but doubtless this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds,melville-moby_dick
how could he forget that in his island days queequeg for one must certainly have been guilty of some murderous convivial indiscretions,melville-moby_dick
in good time though to his great delight the three salt sea warriors would rise and depart to his credulous fable mongering ears all their martial bones jingling in them at every step like moorish scimetars in scabbards,melville-moby_dick
nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin was no companionship socially ahab was inaccessible,melville-moby_dick
the mast head,melville-moby_dick
i take it that the earliest standers of mast heads were the old egyptians because in all my researches i find none prior to them,melville-moby_dick
there is napoleon who upon the top of the column of vendome stands with arms folded some one hundred and fifty feet in the air careless now who rules the decks below whether louis philippe louis blanc or louis the devil,melville-moby_dick
the worthy obed tells us that in the early times of the whale fishery ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game the people of that island erected lofty spars along the sea coast to which the look outs ascended by means of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs in a hen house,melville-moby_dick
there you stand a hundred feet above the silent decks striding along the deep as if the masts were gigantic stilts while beneath you and between your legs as it were swim the hugest monsters of the sea even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at old rhodes,melville-moby_dick
and it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling such as pertains to a bed a hammock a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves,melville-moby_dick
concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mast heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits called crow s nests in which the look outs of a greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas,melville-moby_dick
on the after side or side next the stern of the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for umbrellas comforters and coats,melville-moby_dick
but if we southern whale fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as captain sleet and his greenlandmen were yet that disadvantage is greatly counter balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float,melville-moby_dick
beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye given to unseasonable meditativeness and who offers to ship with the phaedon instead of bowditch in his head,melville-moby_dick
roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll,melville-moby_dick
why thou monkey said a harpooneer to one of these lads we ve been cruising now hard upon three years and thou hast not raised a whale yet,melville-moby_dick
but while this sleep this dream is on ye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and your identity comes back in horror,melville-moby_dick
the quarter deck,melville-moby_dick
did you fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also you would see still stranger foot prints the foot prints of his one unsleeping ever pacing thought,melville-moby_dick
twill soon be out,melville-moby_dick
said the mate astonished at an order seldom or never given on ship board except in some extraordinary case,melville-moby_dick
with bent head and half slouched hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men till stubb cautiously whispered to flask that ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat,melville-moby_dick
was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed voices,melville-moby_dick
and what tune is it ye pull to men,melville-moby_dick
look ye,melville-moby_dick
while the mate was getting the hammer ahab without speaking was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket as if to heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him,melville-moby_dick
it s a white whale i say resumed ahab as he threw down the topmaul a white whale,melville-moby_dick
shouted ahab,melville-moby_dick
and he have one two three oh,melville-moby_dick
men it is moby dick ye have seen moby dick moby dick,melville-moby_dick
aye aye he shouted with a terrific loud animal sob like that of a heart stricken moose aye aye,melville-moby_dick
to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out,melville-moby_dick
god bless ye he seemed to half sob and half shout,melville-moby_dick
art not game for moby dick,melville-moby_dick
hoot,melville-moby_dick
vengeance on a dumb brute,melville-moby_dick
all visible objects man are but as pasteboard masks,melville-moby_dick
sometimes i think there s naught beyond,melville-moby_dick
for could the sun do that then could i do the other since there is ever a sort of fair play herein jealousy presiding over all creations,melville-moby_dick
more intolerable than fiends glarings is a doltish stare,melville-moby_dick
let it go,melville-moby_dick
are they not one and all with ahab in this matter of the whale,melville-moby_dick
stand up amid the general hurricane thy one tost sapling cannot starbuck,melville-moby_dick
from this one poor hunt then the best lance out of all nantucket surely he will not hang back when every foremast hand has clutched a whetstone,melville-moby_dick
thy silence then that voices thee,melville-moby_dick
but in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of the mate ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh from the hold nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts as for a moment their hearts sank in,melville-moby_dick
yet not so much predictions from without as verifications of the foregoing things within,melville-moby_dick
receiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harpooneers he ordered them to produce their weapons,melville-moby_dick
he cried handing the heavy charged flagon to the nearest seaman,melville-moby_dick
it spiralizes in ye forks out at the serpent snapping eye,melville-moby_dick
steward refill,melville-moby_dick
bad pennies come not sooner,melville-moby_dick
well done,melville-moby_dick
stubb and flask looked sideways from him the honest eye of starbuck fell downright,melville-moby_dick
perchance ye need it not,melville-moby_dick
oh my sweet cardinals,melville-moby_dick
stab me not with that keen steel,melville-moby_dick
the irons,melville-moby_dick
bestow them ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league,melville-moby_dick
drink ye harpooneers,melville-moby_dick
once more and finally the replenished pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew when waving his free hand to them they all dispersed and ahab retired within his cabin,melville-moby_dick
the envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track let them but first i pass,melville-moby_dick
is then the crown too heavy that i wear,melville-moby_dick
dry heat upon my brow,melville-moby_dick
gifted with the high perception i lack the low enjoying power damned most subtly and most malignantly,melville-moby_dick
i thought to find one stubborn at the least but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels and they revolve,melville-moby_dick
they think me mad starbuck does but i m demoniac i am madness maddened,melville-moby_dick
now then be the prophet and the fulfiller one,melville-moby_dick
come forth from behind your cotton bags,melville-moby_dick
man has ye there,melville-moby_dick
chapter 38,melville-moby_dick
but he drilled deep down and blasted all my reason out of me,melville-moby_dick
oh,melville-moby_dick
the hated whale has the round watery world to swim in as the small gold fish has its glassy globe,melville-moby_dick
oh god,melville-moby_dick

but there they go all cursing and here i don t,melville-moby_dick
white squalls,melville-moby_dick
and only this evening it makes me jingle all over like my tambourine that anaconda of an old man swore em in to hunt him,melville-moby_dick
a wild mystical sympathetical feeling was in me ahab s quenchless feud seemed mine,melville-moby_dick
it was hardly to be doubted that several vessels reported to have encountered at such or such a time or on such or such a meridian a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity which whale after doing great mischief to his assailants had completely escaped them to some minds it was not an unfair presumption i say that the whale in question must have been no other than moby dick,melville-moby_dick
nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters,melville-moby_dick
no wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the white whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints and half formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies which eventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears,melville-moby_dick
nor is the pre eminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended than on board of those prows which stem him,melville-moby_dick
so that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him not a few of the fishermen recalled in reference to moby dick the earlier days of the sperm whale fishery when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the sperm whale was not for mortal man,melville-moby_dick
nor credulous as such minds must have been was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability,melville-moby_dick
so that here in the real living experience of living men the prodigies related in old times of the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near syracuse whose waters were believed to have come from the holy land by an underground passage these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen,melville-moby_dick
the rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with the same shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinctive appellation of the white whale a name indeed literally justified by his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea leaving a milky way wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden gleamings,melville-moby_dick
but though similar disasters however little bruited ashore were by no means unusual in the fishery yet in most instances such seemed the white whale s infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death that he caused was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent,melville-moby_dick
no turbaned turk no hired venetian or malay could have smote him with more seeming malice,melville-moby_dick
he piled upon the whale s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down and then as if his chest had been a mortar he burst his hot heart s shell upon it,melville-moby_dick
in a strait jacket he swung to the mad rockings of the gales,melville-moby_dick
but as in his narrow flowing monomania not one jot of ahab s broad madness had been left behind so in that broad madness not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished,melville-moby_dick
winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where we here stand however grand and wonderful now quit it and take your way ye nobler sadder souls to those vast roman halls of thermes where far beneath the fantastic towers of man s upper earth his root of grandeur his whole awful essence sits in bearded state an antique buried beneath antiquities and throned on torsoes,melville-moby_dick
aye he did beget ye ye young exiled royalties and from your grim sire only will the old state secret come,melville-moby_dick
the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause,melville-moby_dick
but be all this as it may certain it is that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and all engrossing object of hunting the white whale,melville-moby_dick
such a crew so officered seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge,melville-moby_dick
for one i gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all a rush to encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill,melville-moby_dick
it was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me,melville-moby_dick
that ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terrific to the dumb gloating of their aspect,melville-moby_dick
as for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature when beheld in his ordinary moods strangely tallies with the same quality in the polar quadruped,melville-moby_dick
not coleridge first threw that spell but god s great unflattering laureate nature,melville-moby_dick
at intervals it arched forth its vast archangel wings as if to embrace some holy ark,melville-moby_dick
long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage,melville-moby_dick
never had heard that name before is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore,melville-moby_dick
yet in saying this i do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet,melville-moby_dick
but i doubt not that leathern tally meant for man was taken off in heaven when the white fowl flew to join the wing folding the invoking and adoring cherubim,melville-moby_dick
a most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western world which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when adam walked majestic as a god bluff browed and fearless as this mighty steed,melville-moby_dick
it is that whiteness which invests him a thing expressed by the name he bears,melville-moby_dick
nor in some historic instances has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary,melville-moby_dick
nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms all ghosts rising in a milk white fog yea while these terrors seize us let us add that even the king of terrors when personified by the evangelist rides on his pallid horse,melville-moby_dick
let us try,melville-moby_dick
or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings which will not wholly account for it that makes the white tower of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled american than those other storied structures its neighbors the byward tower or even the bloody,melville-moby_dick
for lima has taken the white veil and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe,melville-moby_dick
yet where is the mariner who will tell thee sir it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me,melville-moby_dick
tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valley of vermont far removed from all beasts of prey why is it that upon the sunniest day if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him so that he cannot even see it but only smells its wild animal muskiness why will he start snort and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright,melville-moby_dick
though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints yet with me as with the colt somewhere those things must exist,melville-moby_dick
and when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers that all other earthly hues every stately or lovely emblazoning the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods yea and the gilded velvets of butterflies and the butterfly cheeks of young girls all these are but subtile deceits not actually inherent in substances but only laid on from without so that all deified nature absolutely paints like the harlot whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel house within and when we proceed further and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues the great principle of light for ever remains white or colourless in itself and if operating without medium upon matter would touch all objects even tulips and roses with its own blank tinge pondering all this the palsied universe lies before us a leper and like wilful travellers in lapland who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him,melville-moby_dick
hist,melville-moby_dick
from hand to hand the buckets went in the deepest silence only broken by the occasional flap of a sail and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel,melville-moby_dick
what noise d ye mean,melville-moby_dick
caramba,melville-moby_dick
aye you are the chap ain t ye that heard the hum of the old quakeress s knitting needles fifty miles at sea from nantucket you re the chap,melville-moby_dick
the bucket,melville-moby_dick
at intervals he would refer to piles of old log books beside him wherein were set down the seasons and places in which on various former voyages of various ships sperm whales had been captured or seen,melville-moby_dick
now to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet,melville-moby_dick
since the above was written the statement is happily borne out by an official circular issued by lieutenant maury of the national observatory washington april 16th 1851,melville-moby_dick
the sum is that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for,melville-moby_dick
in general the same remark only within a less wide limit applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured aged sperm whales,melville-moby_dick
that particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrase the season on the line,melville-moby_dick
no possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards double cape horn and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial pacific in time to cruise there,melville-moby_dick
but granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary whale even if encountered should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter even as a white bearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of constantinople,melville-moby_dick
and here his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength,melville-moby_dick
yet these perhaps instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness or fright at his own resolve were but the plainest tokens of its intensity,melville-moby_dick
therefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes when what seemed ahab rushed from his room was for the time but a vacated thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light to be sure but without an object to colour and therefore a blankness in itself,melville-moby_dick
i care not to perform this part of my task methodically but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman and from these citations i take it the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself,melville-moby_dick
i say i myself have known three instances similar to this that is in two of them i saw the whales struck and upon the second attack saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them afterwards taken from the dead fish,melville-moby_dick
why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil,melville-moby_dick
thou famed leviathan scarred like an iceberg who so long did st lurk in the oriental straits of that name whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of ombay,melville-moby_dick

i do not know where i can find a better place than just here to make mention of one or two other things which to me seem important as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe,melville-moby_dick
do you suppose that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps caught by the whale line off the coast of new guinea is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan do you suppose that that poor fellow s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read to morrow at your breakfast,melville-moby_dick
not a gallon you burn but at least one drop of man s blood was spilled for it,melville-moby_dick
one day she saw spouts lowered her boats and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales,melville-moby_dick
being returned home at last captain pollard once more sailed for the pacific in command of another ship but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers for the second time his ship was utterly lost and forthwith forswearing the sea he has never tempted it since,melville-moby_dick
his aspect was most horrible and such as indicated resentment and fury,melville-moby_dick
in another place p 45 he speaks of the mysterious and mortal attack of the animal,melville-moby_dick
very good but there is more coming,melville-moby_dick
was not saul of tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright,melville-moby_dick
by the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail and the next day we were out in the open sea on our way to ochotsh,melville-moby_dick
the masts reeled and the sails fell altogether while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck concluding that we had struck upon some rock instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity,melville-moby_dick
he substantiates every word,melville-moby_dick
and indeed the shock was so sudden and violent that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock but when the amazement was a little over we cast the lead and sounded but found no ground,melville-moby_dick
but i should not much wonder if in the darkness of that early hour of the morning the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath,melville-moby_dick
but i must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration a remarkable and most significant one by which you will not fail to see that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day but that these marvels like all marvels are mere repetitions of the ages so that for the millionth time we say amen with solomon verily there is nothing new under the sun,melville-moby_dick
a fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid,melville-moby_dick
for a long time i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it,melville-moby_dick
in the propontis as far as i can learn none of that peculiar substance called brit is to be found the aliment of the right whale,melville-moby_dick
though consumed with the hot fire of his purpose ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of moby dick though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman s ways altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage,melville-moby_dick
he knew for example that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over starbuck yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation,melville-moby_dick
for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable they live in the varying outer weather and they inhale its fickleness and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and passion in the end it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash,melville-moby_dick
for even the high lifted and chivalric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre without committing burglaries picking pockets and gaining other pious perquisites by the way,melville-moby_dick
having impulsively it is probable and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the pequod s voyage ahab was now entirely conscious that in so doing he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his crew if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all further obedience to him and even violently wrest from him the command,melville-moby_dick
this vigilance was not long without reward,melville-moby_dick
so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self,melville-moby_dick
meantime queequeg s impulsive indifferent sword sometimes hitting the woof slantingly or crookedly or strongly or weakly as the case might be and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric this savage s sword thought i which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof this easy indifferent sword must be chance aye chance free will and necessity nowise incompatible all interweavingly working together,melville-moby_dick
to be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas from hundreds of whalemen s look outs perched as high in the air but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from tashtego the indian s,melville-moby_dick
there,melville-moby_dick
a school of them,melville-moby_dick
was now the cry from tashtego and the whales disappeared,melville-moby_dick
dough boy hurried below glanced at the watch and reported the exact minute to ahab,melville-moby_dick
the sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down the line tubs were fixed in their places the cranes were thrust out the mainyard was backed and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs,melville-moby_dick
chapter 48,melville-moby_dick
a rumpled chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff,melville-moby_dick
lower away then d ye hear,melville-moby_dick
but with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart fedallah and his crew the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command,melville-moby_dick
lay back,melville-moby_dick
oh i don t mind em sir said archy i knew it all before now,melville-moby_dick
flask,melville-moby_dick
tut,melville-moby_dick
three cheers men all hearts alive,melville-moby_dick
that s it that s it,melville-moby_dick
pull will ye,melville-moby_dick
here,melville-moby_dick
start her marling spikes,melville-moby_dick
besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself so loungingly managed his steering oar and so broadly gaped open mouthed at times that the mere sight of such a yawning commander by sheer force of contrast acted like a charm upon the crew,melville-moby_dick
a word with ye sir if ye please,melville-moby_dick
strong strong boys,melville-moby_dick
spring my men spring,melville-moby_dick
aye aye i thought as much soliloquized stubb when the boats diverged as soon as i clapt eye on em i thought so,melville-moby_dick
can t be helped,melville-moby_dick
now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship s company but archy s fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them though indeed not credited then this had in some small measure prepared them for the event,melville-moby_dick
as for fedallah who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jacket and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon while at the other end of the boat ahab with one arm like a fencer s thrown half backward into the air as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him,melville-moby_dick
every man look out along his oars,melville-moby_dick
not very far distant flask s boat was also lying breathlessly still its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead a stout sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform,melville-moby_dick
upon this daggoo with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way swiftly slid aft and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty shoulders for a pedestal,melville-moby_dick
and here was flask now standing daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by,melville-moby_dick
the bearer looked nobler than the rider,melville-moby_dick
he withdrew it from his hatband where he always wore it aslant like a feather,melville-moby_dick
seen in advance of all the other indications the puffs of vapour they spouted seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders,melville-moby_dick
only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers now harsh with command now soft with entreaty,melville-moby_dick
lay me on lay me on,melville-moby_dick
and so shouting he pulled his hat from his head and stamped up and down on it then picking it up flirted it far off upon the sea and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie,melville-moby_dick
pudding for supper you know merry s the word,melville-moby_dick
crack all your backbones and bite your knives in two that s all,melville-moby_dick
the repeated specific allusions of flask to that whale as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat s bow with its tail these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life like that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder,melville-moby_dick
the dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud shadows flung upon the sea,melville-moby_dick
give way men whispered starbuck drawing still further aft the sheet of his sail there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall comes,melville-moby_dick
though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that the imminent instant had come they heard too an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter,melville-moby_dick
a short rushing sound leaped out of the boat it was the darted iron of queequeg,melville-moby_dick
swimming round it we picked up the floating oars and lashing them across the gunwale tumbled back to our places,melville-moby_dick
the rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat,melville-moby_dick
wet drenched through and shivering cold despairing of ship or boat we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on,melville-moby_dick
affrighted we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length,melville-moby_dick
chapter 49,melville-moby_dick
and as for small difficulties and worryings prospects of sudden disaster peril of life and limb all these and death itself seem to him only sly good natured hits and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker,melville-moby_dick
mr stubb said i turning to that worthy who buttoned up in his oil jacket was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain mr stubb i think i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chief mate mr starbuck is by far the most careful and prudent,melville-moby_dick
will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery mr flask for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back foremost into death s jaws,melville-moby_dick
ha ha,melville-moby_dick
it may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion,melville-moby_dick
i looked round me tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault,melville-moby_dick
who would have thought it flask,melville-moby_dick
if his leg were off at the hip now it would be a different thing,melville-moby_dick
but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect,melville-moby_dick
nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter,melville-moby_dick
besides now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks bits of wreck oars whaleboats canoes blown off japanese junks and what not that beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle,melville-moby_dick
chapter 51,melville-moby_dick
fedallah first descried this jet,melville-moby_dick
there she blows,melville-moby_dick
then with every mast head manned the piled up craft rolled down before the wind,melville-moby_dick
but though the ship so swiftly sped and though from every eye like arrows the eager glances shot yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night,melville-moby_dick
mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight or starlight as the case might be disappearing again for one whole day or two days or three and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on,melville-moby_dick
close to our bows strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea ravens,melville-moby_dick
but calm snow white and unvarying still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky still beckoning us on from before the solitary jet would at times be descried,melville-moby_dick
meantime the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist and the better to guard against the leaping waves each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail in which he swung as in a loosened belt,melville-moby_dick
on the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of,melville-moby_dick
terrible old man,melville-moby_dick
as she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at the fore mast head i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheries a whaler at sea and long absent from home,melville-moby_dick
they seemed clad in the skins of beasts so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising,melville-moby_dick
meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between,melville-moby_dick
and this time three years if i am not at home tell them to address them to,melville-moby_dick
there seemed but little in the words but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced,melville-moby_dick
only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started where those that we left behind secure were all the time before us,melville-moby_dick
the ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this the wind and sea betokened storms,melville-moby_dick
and especially would this seem to be a matter of course in the case of vessels owned in one seaport and whose captains officers and not a few of the men are personally known to each other and consequently have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about,melville-moby_dick
besides they would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable chat,melville-moby_dick
but where this superiority in the english whalemen does really consist it would be hard to say seeing that the yankees in one day collectively kill more whales than all the english collectively in ten years,melville-moby_dick
as touching slave ships meeting why they are in such a prodigious hurry they run away from each other as soon as possible,melville-moby_dick
what does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather,melville-moby_dick
and besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashion he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude,melville-moby_dick
nevertheless this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankees,melville-moby_dick
there is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten here,melville-moby_dick
and as for a tiller the whale boat never admits of any such effeminacy and therefore as in gamming a complete boat s crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and the captain having no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree,melville-moby_dick
then again it would never do in plain sight of the world s riveted eyes it would never do i say for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands indeed as token of his entire buoyant self command he generally carries his hands in his trowsers pockets but perhaps being generally very large heavy hands he carries them there for ballast,melville-moby_dick
the cape of good hope and all the watery region round about there is much like some noted four corners of a great highway where you meet more travellers than in any other part,melville-moby_dick
this latter circumstance with its own particular accompaniments forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated never reached the ears of captain ahab or his mates,melville-moby_dick
the ancient whale cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast head still used by whalemen in hunting the famous gallipagos terrapin,melville-moby_dick
one morning upon handling the pumps according to daily usage it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common,melville-moby_dick
in truth well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes the town ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality had it not been for the brutal overbearing of radney the mate a vineyarder and the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and desperado from buffalo,melville-moby_dick
now gentlemen in square sail brigs and three masted ships well nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far manilla this lakeman in the land locked heart of our america had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean,melville-moby_dick
yet was this nantucketer a man with some good hearted traits and this lakeman a mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by inflexible firmness only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave s right thus treated this steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile,melville-moby_dick
it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters some really landless latitude that her captain begins to feel a little anxious,melville-moby_dick
so when they were working that evening at the pumps there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water clear as any mountain spring gentlemen that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper holes,melville-moby_dick
espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest the lakeman affected not to notice him but unawed went on with his gay banterings,melville-moby_dick
the fact is boys that sword fish only began the job he s come back again with a gang of ship carpenters saw fish and file fish and what not and the whole posse of em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom making improvements i suppose,melville-moby_dick
i wonder if he d give a poor devil like me the model of his nose,melville-moby_dick
aye aye sir said steelkilt merry as a cricket,melville-moby_dick
intolerably striding along the deck the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks and also a shovel and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large,melville-moby_dick
i mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men,melville-moby_dick
and then without at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers who not being billeted at the pumps had done little or nothing all day,melville-moby_dick
and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor the lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer,melville-moby_dick
retreating not the thousandth part of an inch stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance steelkilt clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt would murder him,melville-moby_dick
canallers,melville-moby_dick
you must have heard of it,melville-moby_dick
for three hundred and sixty miles gentlemen through the entire breadth of the state of new york through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages through long dismal uninhabited swamps and affluent cultivated fields unrivalled for fertility by billiard room and bar room through the holy of holies of great forests on roman arches over indian rivers through sun and shade by happy hearts or broken through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble mohawk counties and especially by rows of snow white chapels whose spires stand almost like milestones flows one continual stream of venetianly corrupt and often lawless life,melville-moby_dick
well for our northern friend dame isabella s inquisition wanes in lima laughed don sebastian,melville-moby_dick
in the name of all us limeese i but desire to express to you sir sailor that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present lima for distant venice in your corrupt comparison,melville-moby_dick
mark st,melville-moby_dick
like mark antony for days and days along his green turfed flowery nile he indolently floats openly toying with his red cheeked cleopatra ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck,melville-moby_dick
in sum gentlemen what the wildness of this canal life is is emphatically evinced by this that our wild whale fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates and that scarce any race of mankind except sydney men are so much distrusted by our whaling captains,melville-moby_dick
no need to travel,melville-moby_dick
but sliding down the ropes like baleful comets the two canallers rushed into the uproar and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle,melville-moby_dick
roared the captain now menacing them with a pistol in each hand just brought to him by the steward,melville-moby_dick
demanded their ringleader,melville-moby_dick
and he once more raised a pistol,melville-moby_dick
what say ye men,melville-moby_dick
captain by god look to yourself say the word don t be a fool forget it all we are ready to turn to treat us decently and we re your men but we won t be flogged,melville-moby_dick
roared the captain,melville-moby_dick
cried the ringleader to his men,melville-moby_dick
but the hours of darkness passed in peace the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship,melville-moby_dick
emboldened by this the captain reiterated his demand to the rest but steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged,melville-moby_dick
shut us up again will ye,melville-moby_dick
that was the last night he should spend in that den,melville-moby_dick
upon hearing the frantic project of their leader each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the same piece of treachery namely to be foremost in breaking out in order to be the first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit,melville-moby_dick
damn ye cried the captain pacing to and fro before them the vultures would not touch ye ye villains,melville-moby_dick
take that gag from his mouth and let us hear what he can say for himself,melville-moby_dick
but i must and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke,melville-moby_dick
you are a coward,melville-moby_dick
the three men were then cut down all hands were turned to and sullenly worked by the moody seamen the iron pumps clanged as before,melville-moby_dick
but in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage they all agreed to another thing namely not to sing out for whales in case any should be discovered,melville-moby_dick
during the night radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter deck and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there a little above the ship s side,melville-moby_dick
what are you making there,melville-moby_dick
yes rather oddish said the lakeman holding it at arm s length before him but i think it will answer,melville-moby_dick
said a sailor,melville-moby_dick
twenty four hours after his trick at the silent helm nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman s hand that fatal hour was then to come and in the fore ordaining soul of steelkilt the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse with his forehead crushed in,melville-moby_dick
there she rolls,melville-moby_dick
dominic,melville-moby_dick
how,melville-moby_dick
the chicha,melville-moby_dick
the white whale the white whale,melville-moby_dick
after a stiff pull their harpooneer got fast and spear in hand radney sprang to the bow,melville-moby_dick
he struck out through the spray and for an instant was dimly seen through that veil wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of moby dick,melville-moby_dick
but at some distance moby dick rose again with some tatters of radney s red woollen shirt caught in the teeth that had destroyed him,melville-moby_dick
but to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated both by night and by day and so extreme was the hard work they underwent that upon the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel,melville-moby_dick
with one foot on each prow of the yoked war canoes the lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock he would bury him in bubbles and foam,melville-moby_dick
demanded steelkilt no lies,melville-moby_dick
cross your arms sir throw back your head,melville-moby_dick
adios senor,melville-moby_dick
some ten days after the french ships sailed the whale boat arrived and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized tahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea,melville-moby_dick
i am don,melville-moby_dick
also bear with all of us sir sailor for we all join in don sebastian s suit cried the company with exceeding interest,melville-moby_dick
will you be so good as to bring the priest also don,melville-moby_dick
this is the priest he brings you the evangelists said don sebastian gravely returning with a tall and solemn figure,melville-moby_dick
chapter 55,melville-moby_dick
it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest hindoo egyptian and grecian sculptures,melville-moby_dick
the hindoo whale referred to occurs in a separate department of the wall depicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly known as the matse avatar,melville-moby_dick
where did guido get the model of such a strange creature as that,melville-moby_dick
what shall be said of these,melville-moby_dick
in the title page of the original edition of the advancement of learning you will find some curious whales,melville-moby_dick
then again there is an imposing quarto written by one captain colnett a post captain in the english navy entitled a voyage round cape horn into the south seas for the purpose of extending the spermaceti whale fisheries,melville-moby_dick
nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for the benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of mistake,melville-moby_dick
all these are not only incorrect but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland whale that is to say the right whale even scoresby a long experienced man as touching that species declares not to have its counterpart in nature,melville-moby_dick
of course he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage such men seldom have but whence he derived that picture who can tell,melville-moby_dick
whales with dromedary humps and very savage breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts that is whaleboats full of mariners their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint,melville-moby_dick
the living whale in his full majesty and significance is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight like a launched line of battle ship and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations,melville-moby_dick
though jeremy bentham s skeleton which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors correctly conveys the idea of a burly browed utilitarian old gentleman with all jeremy s other leading personal characteristics yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan s articulated bones,melville-moby_dick
but all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering as the human fingers in an artificial covering,melville-moby_dick
and the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is by going a whaling yourself but by so doing you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him,melville-moby_dick
but i pass that matter by,melville-moby_dick
his frontispiece boats attacking sperm whales though no doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men is admirably correct and life like in its general effect,melville-moby_dick
but taken for all in all by far the finest though in some details not the most correct presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found are two large french engravings well executed and taken from paintings by one garnery,melville-moby_dick
the half emptied line tub floats on the whitened sea the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene,melville-moby_dick
and all the while the thick lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle wheels of an ocean steamer,melville-moby_dick
go and gaze upon all the paintings of europe and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas as in that triumphal hall at versailles where the beholder fights his way pell mell through the consecutive great battles of france where every sword seems a flash of the northern lights and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by like a charge of crowned centaurs,melville-moby_dick
even scoresby the justly renowned right whaleman after giving us a stiff full length of the greenland whale and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks chopping knives and grapnels and with the microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety six fac similes of magnified arctic snow crystals,melville-moby_dick
it is a quiet noon scene among the isles of the pacific a french whaler anchored inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sails of the ship and the long leaves of the palms in the background both drooping together in the breezeless air,melville-moby_dick
chapter 57,melville-moby_dick
but the time of his justification has now come,melville-moby_dick
but in general they toil with their jack knives alone and with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor they will turn you out anything you please in the way of a mariner s fancy,melville-moby_dick
now one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours is his wonderful patience of industry,melville-moby_dick
wooden whales or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble south sea war wood are frequently met with in the forecastles of american whalers,melville-moby_dick
on the spires of some old fashioned churches you will see sheet iron whales placed there for weather cocks but they are so elevated and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with hands off,melville-moby_dick
nor when expandingly lifted by your subject can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens and boats in pursuit of them as when long filled with thoughts of war the eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds,melville-moby_dick
brit,melville-moby_dick
,melville-moby_dick
and even when recognised at last their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct in all parts with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse,melville-moby_dick
the first boat we read of floated on an ocean that with portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow,melville-moby_dick
but not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it but it is also a fiend to its own off spring worse than the persian host who murdered his own guests sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned,melville-moby_dick
consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks,melville-moby_dick
push not off from that isle thou canst never return,melville-moby_dick
but one transparent blue morning when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea however unattended with any stagnant calm when the long burnished sun glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them enjoining some secrecy when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by daggoo from the main mast head,melville-moby_dick
thought daggoo,melville-moby_dick
the white whale the white whale,melville-moby_dick
soon it went down and while with oars suspended we were awaiting its reappearance lo,melville-moby_dick
as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk with a wild voice exclaimed almost rather had i seen moby dick and fought him than to have seen thee thou white ghost,melville-moby_dick
whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object certain it is that a glimpse of it being so very unusual that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness,melville-moby_dick
there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid,melville-moby_dick
the line,melville-moby_dick
the whale line is only two thirds of an inch in thickness,melville-moby_dick
as the least tangle or kink in the coiling would in running out infallibly take somebody s arm leg or entire body off the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub,melville-moby_dick
both ends of the line are exposed the lower end terminating in an eye splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything,melville-moby_dick
before lowering the boat for the chase the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub and passing round the loggerhead there is again carried forward the entire length of the boat resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man s oar so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing and also passing between the men as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill prevents it from slipping out,melville-moby_dick
yet habit strange thing,melville-moby_dick
again as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm is perhaps more awful than the storm itself for indeed the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm and contains it in itself as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder and the ball and the explosion so the graceful repose of the line as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair,melville-moby_dick
chapter 61,melville-moby_dick
for this part of the indian ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground that is it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises dolphins flying fish and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters than those off the rio de la plata or the in shore ground off peru,melville-moby_dick
the waves too nodded their indolent crests and across the wide trance of the sea east nodded to west and the sun over all,melville-moby_dick
but that pipe poor whale was thy last,melville-moby_dick
and obeying his own order he dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes,melville-moby_dick
was the cry an announcement immediately followed by stubb s producing his match and igniting his pipe for now a respite was granted,melville-moby_dick
and still puffing at his pipe stubb cheered on his crew to the assault,melville-moby_dick
though apparently the most massive it is by far the most buoyant part about him,melville-moby_dick
start her now give em the long and strong stroke tashtego,melville-moby_dick
screamed the gay header in reply raising some old war whoop to the skies as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager indian gave,melville-moby_dick
ka la,melville-moby_dick
like desperadoes they tugged and they strained till the welcome cry was heard stand up tashtego give it to him,melville-moby_dick
an instant before stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead whence by reason of its increased rapid circlings a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe,melville-moby_dick
cried stubb to the tub oarsman him seated by the tub who snatching off his hat dashed sea water into it,melville-moby_dick
your hat however is the most convenient,melville-moby_dick
haul in haul in,melville-moby_dick
his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake,melville-moby_dick
pull up close to,melville-moby_dick
and now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out into view surging from side to side spasmodically dilating and contracting his spout hole with sharp cracking agonized respirations,melville-moby_dick
and withdrawing his own from his mouth stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water and for a moment stood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made,melville-moby_dick
now it needs a strong nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in what is called a long dart the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet,melville-moby_dick
no wonder taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body that out of fifty fair chances for a dart not five are successful no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood vessels in the boat no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels no wonder that to many ship owners whaling is but a losing concern for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted,melville-moby_dick
i know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them,melville-moby_dick
so in productive subjects grow the chapters,melville-moby_dick
but these two harpoons each by its own cord are both connected with the line the object being this to dart them both if possible one instantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the coming drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold,melville-moby_dick
but this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties,melville-moby_dick
all these particulars are faithfully narrated here as they will not fail to elucidate several most important however intricate passages in scenes hereafter to be painted,melville-moby_dick
and now as we eighteen men with our thirty six arms and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert sluggish corpse in the sea and it seemed hardly to budge at all except at long intervals good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved,melville-moby_dick
very soon you would have thought from the sound on the pequod s decks that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck and thrust rattling out of the port holes,melville-moby_dick
the strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside is by the flukes or tail and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other excepting the side fins its flexibility even in death causes it to sink low beneath the surface so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat in order to put the chain round it,melville-moby_dick
one small helping cause of all this liveliness in stubb was soon made strangely manifest,melville-moby_dick
here be it known that though these wild fishermen do not as a general thing and according to the great military maxim make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage yet now and then you find some of these nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale designated by stubb comprising the tapering extremity of the body,melville-moby_dick
peering over the side you could just see them as before you heard them wallowing in the sullen black waters and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head,melville-moby_dick
if you have never seen that sight then suspend your decision about the propriety of devil worship and the expediency of conciliating the devil,melville-moby_dick
cook said stubb rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth don t you think this steak is rather overdone,melville-moby_dick
cook go and talk to em tell em they are welcome to help themselves civilly and in moderation but they must keep quiet,melville-moby_dick
fellow critters i se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare,melville-moby_dick
cook here interposed stubb accompanying the word with a sudden slap on the shoulder cook,melville-moby_dick
no cook go on go on,melville-moby_dick
how you tink to hear spose you keep up such a dam slappin and bitin dare,melville-moby_dick
you is sharks sartin but if you gobern de shark in you why den you be angel for all angel is not ing more dan de shark well goberned,melville-moby_dick
i know some o you has berry brig mout brigger dan oders but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid but to bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks dat can t get into de scrouge to help demselves,melville-moby_dick
upon this fleece holding both hands over the fishy mob raised his shrill voice and cried,melville-moby_dick
well said stubb helping himself freely meanwhile i shall now go back to the subject of this steak,melville-moby_dick
bout ninety dey say he gloomily muttered,melville-moby_dick
born in a ferry boat,melville-moby_dick
no you didn t cook but i ll tell you what i m coming to cook,melville-moby_dick
faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment the old negro muttered best cooked teak i eber taste joosy berry joosy,melville-moby_dick
said stubb,melville-moby_dick
i mean when you die cook,melville-moby_dick
how,melville-moby_dick
but don t you know the higher you climb the colder it gets,melville-moby_dick
but perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubber s hole cook but no no cook you don t get there except you go the regular way round by the rigging,melville-moby_dick
hold your hat in one hand and clap t other a top of your heart when i m giving my orders cook,melville-moby_dick
hold it there now and pay attention,melville-moby_dick
and now to morrow cook when we are cutting in the fish be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins have them put in pickle,melville-moby_dick
d ye hear,melville-moby_dick
wish by gor,melville-moby_dick
that mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp and like stubb eat him by his own light as you may say this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it,melville-moby_dick
the old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them,melville-moby_dick
zogranda one of their most famous doctors recommends strips of blubber for infants as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing,melville-moby_dick
he is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be delicately good,melville-moby_dick
many a good supper have i thus made,melville-moby_dick
expression,melville-moby_dick
does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal s jaw,melville-moby_dick
and that is adding insult to injury is it,melville-moby_dick
it is only within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronise nothing but steel pens,melville-moby_dick
therefore the common usage is to take in all sail lash the helm a lee and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight with the reservation that until that time anchor watches shall be kept that is two and two for an hour each couple the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well,melville-moby_dick
but in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts the marksmen could not always hit their mark and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe,melville-moby_dick
killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin one of these sharks almost took poor queequeg s hand off when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw,melville-moby_dick
chapter 67,melville-moby_dick
you would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods,melville-moby_dick
when instantly the entire ship careens over on her side every bolt in her starts like the nail heads of an old house in frosty weather she trembles quivers and nods her frighted mast heads to the sky,melville-moby_dick
into this hole the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber in order to prepare for what follows,melville-moby_dick
chapter 68,melville-moby_dick
the question is what and where is the skin of the whale,melville-moby_dick
i have several such dried bits which i use for marks in my whale books,melville-moby_dick
but no more of this,melville-moby_dick
but these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned but seem to be seen through it as if they were engraved upon the body itself,melville-moby_dick
like those mystic rocks too the mystic marked whale remains undecipherable,melville-moby_dick
a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale,melville-moby_dick
what would become of a greenland whale say in those shuddering icy seas of the north if unsupplied with his cosy surtout,melville-moby_dick
but more surprising is it to know as has been proved by experiment that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than that of a borneo negro in summer,melville-moby_dick
do thou too live in this world without being of it,melville-moby_dick
of erections how few are domed like st peter s,melville-moby_dick
let the carcase go astern,melville-moby_dick
the vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the ship and every rod that it so floats what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls augment the murderous din,melville-moby_dick
in life but few of them would have helped the whale i ween if peradventure he had needed it but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce,melville-moby_dick
espied by some timid man of war or blundering discovery vessel from afar when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun and the white spray heaving high against it straightway the whale s unharming corpse with trembling fingers is set down in the log shoals rocks and breakers hereabouts beware,melville-moby_dick
are you a believer in ghosts my friend,melville-moby_dick
now the beheading of the sperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves and not without reason,melville-moby_dick
when first severed the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped,melville-moby_dick
when this last task was accomplished it was noon and the seamen went below to their dinner,melville-moby_dick
it was a black and hooded head and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm it seemed the sphynx s in the desert,melville-moby_dick
thou hast been where bell or diver never went hast slept by many a sailor s side where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down,melville-moby_dick
sail ho,melville-moby_dick
three points on the starboard bow sir and bringing down her breeze to us,melville-moby_dick
not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter but has its cunning duplicate in mind,melville-moby_dick
but as she was so far to windward and shooting by apparently making a passage to some other ground the pequod could not hope to reach her,melville-moby_dick
squaring her yards she bore down ranged abeam under the pequod s lee and lowered a boat it soon drew nigh but as the side ladder was being rigged by starbuck s order to accommodate the visiting captain the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary,melville-moby_dick
subject to this and other the like interruptions now and then a conversation was sustained between the two parties but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort,melville-moby_dick
so soon as this figure had been first descried stubb had exclaimed that s he,melville-moby_dick
he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeuna shakers where he had been a great prophet in their cracked secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trap door announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial which he carried in his vest pocket but which instead of containing gunpowder was supposed to be charged with laudanum,melville-moby_dick
the unflinching earnestness with which he declared these things the dark daring play of his sleepless excited imagination and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium united to invest this gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew with an atmosphere of sacredness,melville-moby_dick
nor would they permit gabriel to be any way maltreated say or do what he would so that it came to pass that gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship,melville-moby_dick
but it is time to return to the pequod,melville-moby_dick
gabriel,melville-moby_dick
think think of thy whale boat stoven and sunk,melville-moby_dick
when this interlude was over captain mayhew began a dark story concerning moby dick not however without frequent interruptions from gabriel whenever his name was mentioned and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him,melville-moby_dick
meantime gabriel ascending to the main royal mast head was tossing one arm in frantic gestures and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity,melville-moby_dick
it is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accidents in the sperm whale fishery this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any,melville-moby_dick
the vial,melville-moby_dick
to which ahab answered aye,melville-moby_dick
thus most letters never reach their mark and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three years or more,melville-moby_dick
cried ahab,melville-moby_dick
poor fellow,melville-moby_dick
yelled ahab,melville-moby_dick
then gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the pequod,melville-moby_dick
now hands are wanted here and then again hands are wanted there,melville-moby_dick
but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole,melville-moby_dick
on the occasion in question queequeg figured in the highland costume a shirt and socks in which to my eyes at least he appeared to uncommon advantage and no one had a better chance to observe him as will presently be seen,melville-moby_dick
for before we proceed further it must be said that the monkey rope was fast at both ends fast to queequeg s broad canvas belt and fast to my narrow leather one,melville-moby_dick
therefore i saw that here was a sort of interregnum in providence for its even handed equity never could have so gross an injustice,melville-moby_dick
nor could i possibly forget that do what i would i only had the management of one end of it,melville-moby_dick
but this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to,melville-moby_dick
accordingly besides the monkey rope with which i now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark he was provided with still another protection,melville-moby_dick
well well my dear comrade and twin brother thought i as i drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea what matters it after all,melville-moby_dick
for now as with blue lips and blood shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side the steward advances and with a benevolent consolatory glance hands him what,melville-moby_dick
ginger,melville-moby_dick
ginger,melville-moby_dick
firewood lucifer matches tinder gunpowder what the devil is ginger i say that you offer this cup to our poor queequeg here,melville-moby_dick
and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a half drowned man,melville-moby_dick
ginger jub,melville-moby_dick
it is the captain s orders grog for the harpooneer on a whale,melville-moby_dick
when stubb reappeared he came with a dark flask in one hand and a sort of tea caddy in the other,melville-moby_dick
but we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it,melville-moby_dick
tall spouts were seen to leeward and two boats stubb s and flask s were detached in pursuit,melville-moby_dick
cut cut,melville-moby_dick
and they stuck to it till they did gain it when instantly a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel as the strained line scraping beneath the ship suddenly rose to view under her bows snapping and quivering and so flinging off its drippings that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water while the whale beyond also rose to sight and once more the boats were free to fly,melville-moby_dick
i wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard said stubb not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so ignoble a leviathan,melville-moby_dick
but i sometimes think he ll charm the ship to no good at last,melville-moby_dick
flask i take that fedallah to be the devil in disguise,melville-moby_dick
now that i think of it he s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots,melville-moby_dick
striking up a swap or a bargain i suppose,melville-moby_dick
i don t know flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wicked one i tell ye,melville-moby_dick
says the old governor,melville-moby_dick
i think i remember some such story as you were telling said flask when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship but i can t remember where,melville-moby_dick
no never saw such a book heard of it though,melville-moby_dick
and if the devil has a latch key to get into the admiral s cabin don t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole,melville-moby_dick
pointing to the ship well that s the figure one now take all the hoops in the pequod s hold and string along in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well that wouldn t begin to be fedallah s age,melville-moby_dick
but he d crawl back,melville-moby_dick
who s afraid of him except the old governor who daresn t catch him and put him in double darbies as he deserves but lets him go about kidnapping people aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devil kidnapped he d roast for him,melville-moby_dick
but i am going now to keep a sharp look out on him and if i see anything very suspicious going on i ll just take him by the nape of his neck and say look here beelzebub you don t do it and if he makes any fuss by the lord i ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail take it to the capstan and give him such a wrenching and heaving that his tail will come short off at the stump do you see and then i rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion he ll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs,melville-moby_dick
mean or not mean here we are at the ship,melville-moby_dick
as before the pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale s head now by the counterpoise of both heads she regained her even keel though sorely strained you may well believe,melville-moby_dick
in disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the ship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cut off whole but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown piece,melville-moby_dick
as the crew toiled on laplandish speculations were bandied among them concerning all these passing things,melville-moby_dick
they are the only whales regularly hunted by man,melville-moby_dick
there is more character in the sperm whale s head,melville-moby_dick
far back on the side of the head and low down near the angle of either whale s jaw if you narrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which you would fancy to be a young colt s eye so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head,melville-moby_dick
in a word you would have two backs so to speak but at the same time also two fronts side fronts for what is it that makes the front of a man what indeed but his eyes,melville-moby_dick
this peculiarity of the whale s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes,melville-moby_dick
but if you now come to separate these two objects and surround each by a circle of profound darkness then in order to see one of them in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness,melville-moby_dick
it may be but an idle whim but it has always seemed to me that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats the timidity and liability to queer frights so common to such whales i think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them,melville-moby_dick
with respect to their ears this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right,melville-moby_dick
subtilize it,melville-moby_dick
but come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff box with the hinge at one end instead of one side,melville-moby_dick
in most cases this lower jaw being easily unhinged by a practised artist is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles including canes umbrella stocks and handles to riding whips,melville-moby_dick
chapter 75,melville-moby_dick
and in this same last or shoe that old woman of the nursery tale with the swarming brood might very comfortably be lodged she and all her progeny,melville-moby_dick
but if this whale be a king he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem,melville-moby_dick
the fissure is about a foot across,melville-moby_dick
is this the road that jonah went,melville-moby_dick
at any rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable,melville-moby_dick
as every one knows these same hogs bristles fins whiskers blinds or whatever you please furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances,melville-moby_dick
seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about would you not think you were inside of the great haarlem organ and gazing upon its thousand pipes,melville-moby_dick
to sum up then in the right whale s there is no great well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandible of a lower jaw like the sperm whale s,melville-moby_dick
it is the same he died with only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away,melville-moby_dick
this right whale i take to have been a stoic the sperm whale a platonian who might have taken up spinoza in his latter years,melville-moby_dick
here is a vital point for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling but not the less true events perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history,melville-moby_dick
so that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad,melville-moby_dick
it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were paved with horses hoofs,melville-moby_dick
no they hold there a large round wad of tow and cork enveloped in the thickest and toughest of ox hide,melville-moby_dick
now mark,melville-moby_dick
what befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess s veil at lais,melville-moby_dick
regarding the sperm whale s head as a solid oblong you may on an inclined plane sideways divide it into two quoins whereof the lower is the bony structure forming the cranium and jaws and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale,melville-moby_dick
a quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of both sides,melville-moby_dick
nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature,melville-moby_dick
as in decapitating the whale the operator s instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine he has therefore to be uncommonly heedful lest a careless untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents,melville-moby_dick
nimble as a cat tashtego mounts aloft and without altering his erect posture runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard arm to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted tun,melville-moby_dick
a short handled sharp spade being sent up to him he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the tun,melville-moby_dick
carefully lowered from its height the full freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand and quickly emptied into a large tub,melville-moby_dick
poor tashtego like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well dropped head foremost down into this great tun of heidelburgh and with a horrible oily gurgling went clean out of sight,melville-moby_dick
meantime there was a terrible tumult,melville-moby_dick
yelled the seamen to daggoo but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles so that if the head should drop he would still remain suspended the negro having cleared the foul line rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it and so be hoisted out,melville-moby_dick
cried a voice like the bursting of a rocket,melville-moby_dick
some hands now jumped into a boat alongside and pushed a little off from the ship,melville-moby_dick
both it is both,melville-moby_dick
he averred that upon first thrusting in for him a leg was presented but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be and might occasion great trouble he had thrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave and toss had wrought a somerset upon the indian so that with the next trial he came forth in the good old way head foremost,melville-moby_dick
but peradventure it may be sagaciously urged how is this,melville-moby_dick
yes it was a running delivery so it was,melville-moby_dick
the prairie,melville-moby_dick
therefore though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer in the application of these two semi sciences to the whale i will do my endeavor,melville-moby_dick
for as in landscape gardening a spire cupola monument or tower of some sort is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated open work belfry of the nose,melville-moby_dick
as on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly boat your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled,melville-moby_dick
in the repose of the pasture the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it,melville-moby_dick
few are the foreheads which like shakespeare s or melancthon s rise so high and descend so low that the eyes themselves seem clear eternal tideless mountain lakes and all above them in the forehead s wrinkles you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink as the highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer,melville-moby_dick
but how,melville-moby_dick
and this reminds me that had the great sperm whale been known to the young orient world he would have been deified by their child magian thoughts,melville-moby_dick
physiognomy like every other human science is but a passing fable,melville-moby_dick
the nut,melville-moby_dick
at the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass while under the long floor of this crater in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depth reposes the mere handful of this monster s brain,melville-moby_dick
as for his true brain you can then see no indications of it nor feel any,melville-moby_dick
but if from the comparative dimensions of the whale s proper brain you deem it incapable of being adequately charted then i have another idea for you,melville-moby_dick
now i consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal,melville-moby_dick
apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale,melville-moby_dick
under all these circumstances would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale s spine phrenologically,melville-moby_dick
and that the great monster is indomitable you will yet have reason to know,melville-moby_dick
for some reason the jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects,melville-moby_dick
not that said stubb no no it s a coffee pot mr starbuck he s coming off to make us our coffee is the yarman don t you see that big tin can there alongside of him that s his boiling water,melville-moby_dick
however curious it may seem for an oil ship to be borrowing oil on the whale ground and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to newcastle yet sometimes such a thing really happens and in the present case captain derick de deer did indubitably conduct a lamp feeder as flask did declare,melville-moby_dick
aware of their danger they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness,melville-moby_dick
his spout was short slow and laborious coming forth with a choking sort of gush and spending itself in torn shreds followed by strange subterranean commotions in him which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity causing the waters behind him to upbubble,melville-moby_dick
it s the first foul wind i ever knew to blow from astern but look did ever whale yaw so before,melville-moby_dick
mind he don t sling thee with it cried starbuck,melville-moby_dick
as for derick he seemed quite confident that this would be the case and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lamp feeder at the other boats,melville-moby_dick
i tell ye what it is men cried stubb to his crew it s against my religion to get mad but i d like to eat that villainous yarman pull won t ye,melville-moby_dick
who s that been dropping an anchor overboard we don t budge an inch we re becalmed,melville-moby_dick
oh,melville-moby_dick
such a sogger,melville-moby_dick
the unmannerly dutch dogger,melville-moby_dick
i say pull like god dam cried the indian,melville-moby_dick
sail over him,melville-moby_dick
it was a terrific most pitiable and maddening sight,melville-moby_dick
seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the pequod s boats the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his game derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart ere the last chance would for ever escape,melville-moby_dick
hurrah,melville-moby_dick
hurrah,melville-moby_dick
giving a sudden gasp he tumultuously sounded,melville-moby_dick
because owing to the enormous surface of him in a full grown sperm whale something less than 2000 square feet the pressure of the water is immense,melville-moby_dick
not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows,melville-moby_dick
is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly said canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons,melville-moby_dick
oh,melville-moby_dick
stand by men he stirs cried starbuck as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards to them as by magnetic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that every oarsman felt them in his seat,melville-moby_dick
the lines of which hardly an instant before not one hand s breadth could have been gained were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats and soon the whale broke water within two ship s lengths of the hunters,melville-moby_dick
even now when the boats pulled upon this whale and perilously drew over his swaying flukes and the lances were darted into him they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound which kept continually playing while the natural spout hole in his head was only at intervals however rapid sending its affrighted moisture into the air,melville-moby_dick
as strange misgrown masses gather in the knot holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate so from the points which the whale s eyes had once occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiable to see,melville-moby_dick
avast,melville-moby_dick
for by this time so spent was he by loss of blood that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made lay panting on his side impotently flapped with his stumped fin then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up the white secrets of his belly lay like a log and died,melville-moby_dick
by very heedful management when the ship drew nigh the whale was transferred to her side and was strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke chains for it was plain that unless artificially upheld the body would at once sink to the bottom,melville-moby_dick
and when,melville-moby_dick
meantime everything in the pequod was aslant,melville-moby_dick
hold on hold on won t ye,melville-moby_dick
aye aye cried queequeg and seizing the carpenter s heavy hatchet he leaned out of a porthole and steel to iron began slashing at the largest fluke chains,melville-moby_dick
if the only whales that thus sank were old meagre and broken hearted creatures their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him,melville-moby_dick
this difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free,melville-moby_dick
in the shore whaling on soundings among the bays of new zealand when a right whale gives token of sinking they fasten buoys to him with plenty of rope so that when the body has gone down they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again,melville-moby_dick
oh,melville-moby_dick
the more i dive into this matter of whaling and push my researches up to the very spring head of it so much the more am i impressed with its great honourableness and antiquity and especially when i find so many great demi gods and heroes prophets of all sorts who one way or other have shed distinction upon it i am transported with the reflection that i myself belong though but subordinately to so emblazoned a fraternity,melville-moby_dick
and let no man doubt this arkite story for in the ancient joppa now jaffa on the syrian coast in one of the pagan temples there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale which the city s legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slew,melville-moby_dick
besides it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st george but encountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep,melville-moby_dick
and therefore let not the knights of that honourable company none of whom i venture to say have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron let them never eye a nantucketer with disdain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to st george s decoration than they,melville-moby_dick
but by the best contradictory authorities this grecian story of hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale and vice versa certainly they are very similar,melville-moby_dick
when brahma or the god of gods saith the shaster resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions he gave birth to vishnoo to preside over the work but the vedas or mystical books whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo before beginning the creation and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects these vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters so vishnoo became incarnate in a whale and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths rescued the sacred volumes,melville-moby_dick
what club but the whaleman s can head off like that,melville-moby_dick
but then there were some sceptical greeks and romans who standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale and arion and the dolphin and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts for all that,melville-moby_dick
for truly the right whale s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist tables and comfortably seat all the players,melville-moby_dick
nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a life preserver an inflated bag of wind which the endangered prophet swam to and so was saved from a watery doom,melville-moby_dick
but was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of nineveh,melville-moby_dick
but all these foolish arguments of old sag harbor only evinced his foolish pride of reason a thing still more reprehensible in him seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea,melville-moby_dick
and some three centuries ago an english traveller in old harris s voyages speaks of a turkish mosque built in honour of jonah in which mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil,melville-moby_dick
queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau disappeared took more than customary pains in that occupation crawling under its bottom where it hung over the side and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the craft s bald keel,melville-moby_dick
by great exertion tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron but the stricken whale without at all sounding still continued his horizontal flight with added fleetness,melville-moby_dick
of all the wondrous devices and dexterities the sleights of hand and countless subtleties to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced none exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling,melville-moby_dick
but before going further it is important to mention here that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it is seldom done and when done is still less frequently successful on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance which in effect become serious drawbacks,melville-moby_dick
then holding the lance full before his waistband s middle he levels it at the whale when covering him with it he steadily depresses the butt end in his hand thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm fifteen feet in the air,melville-moby_dick
cried stubb,melville-moby_dick
again and again to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart is repeated the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash,melville-moby_dick
let us then look at this matter along with some interesting items contingent,melville-moby_dick
no he breathes through his spiracle alone and this is on the top of his head,melville-moby_dick
how is this,melville-moby_dick
if unmolested upon rising to the surface the sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings,melville-moby_dick
now why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air ere descending for good,melville-moby_dick
but the sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time,melville-moby_dick
no roses no violets no cologne water in the sea,melville-moby_dick
happy that the world is such an excellent listener,melville-moby_dick
but the sperm whale s food is far beneath the surface and there he cannot spout even if he would,melville-moby_dick
my dear sir in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things,melville-moby_dick
for even when tranquilly swimming through the mid day sea in a calm with his elevated hump sun dried as a dromedary s in the desert even then the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain,melville-moby_dick
and i know one who coming into still closer contact with the spout whether with some scientific object in view or otherwise i cannot say the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm,melville-moby_dick
my hypothesis is this that the spout is nothing but mist,melville-moby_dick
the invariable moisture of my hair while plunged in deep thought after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic of an august noon this seems an additional argument for the above supposition,melville-moby_dick
doubts of all things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly this combination makes neither believer nor infidel but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye,melville-moby_dick
the compact round body of its root expands into two broad firm flat palms or flukes gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness,melville-moby_dick
the fibres in the upper and lower layers are long and horizontal those of the middle one very short and running crosswise between the outside layers,melville-moby_dick
nor does this its amazing strength at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions where infantileness of ease undulates through a titanism of power,melville-moby_dick
when angelo paints even god the father in human form mark what robustness is there,melville-moby_dick
first when used as a fin for progression second when used as a mace in battle third in sweeping fourth in lobtailing fifth in peaking flukes,melville-moby_dick
scroll wise coiled forwards beneath the body and then rapidly sprung backwards it is this which gives that singular darting leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming,melville-moby_dick
no ribs of man or boat can withstand it,melville-moby_dick
this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea and if he feel but a sailor s whisker woe to that sailor whiskers and all,melville-moby_dick
but still you see his power in his play,melville-moby_dick
out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven,melville-moby_dick
as ptolemy philopater testified of the african elephant i then testified of the whale pronouncing him the most devout of all beings,melville-moby_dick
,melville-moby_dick
in an extensive herd so remarkable occasionally are these mystic gestures that i have heard hunters who have declared them akin to free mason signs and symbols that the whale indeed by these methods intelligently conversed with the world,melville-moby_dick
thou shalt see my back parts my tail he seems to say but my face shall not be seen,melville-moby_dick
in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of sumatra java bally and timor which with many others form a vast mole or rampart lengthwise connecting asia with australia and dividing the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes,melville-moby_dick
unlike the danes these orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top sails from the endless procession of ships before the wind which for centuries past by night and by day have passed between the islands of sumatra and java freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east,melville-moby_dick
by these means the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost all the known sperm whale cruising grounds of the world previous to descending upon the line in the pacific where ahab though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit firmly counted upon giving battle to moby dick in the sea he was most known to frequent and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it,melville-moby_dick
nay,melville-moby_dick
she has a whole lake s contents bottled in her ample hold,melville-moby_dick
so that did you carry them the news that another flood had come they would only answer well boys here s the ark,melville-moby_dick
to this aggregation of the sperm whale into such immense caravans may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together without being greeted by a single spout and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands,melville-moby_dick
crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them the harpooneers handling their weapons and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats,melville-moby_dick
it seemed formed of detached white vapours rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales only they did not so completely come and go for they constantly hovered without finally disappearing,melville-moby_dick
and when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance and beheld how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end and not only that but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curses when all these conceits had passed through his brain ahab s brow was left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it without being able to drag the firm thing from its place,melville-moby_dick
the compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming were now broken up in one measureless rout and like king porus elephants in the indian battle with alexander they seemed going mad with consternation,melville-moby_dick
though banding together in tens of thousands the lion maned buffaloes of the west have fled before a solitary horseman,melville-moby_dick
in about three minutes time queequeg s harpoon was flung the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces and then running away with us like light steered straight for the heart of the herd,melville-moby_dick
nor were the oarsmen quite idle though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with,melville-moby_dick
cried a second to another which close to our gunwale seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fan like extremity,melville-moby_dick
but sperm whales are not every day encountered while you may then you must kill all you can,melville-moby_dick
they were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball,melville-moby_dick
here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales were heard but not felt,melville-moby_dick
we must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up,melville-moby_dick
like household dogs they came snuffling round us right up to our gunwales and touching them till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them,melville-moby_dick
floating on their sides the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us,melville-moby_dick
line,melville-moby_dick
cried starbuck,melville-moby_dick
we saw young leviathan amours in the deep,melville-moby_dick
when overflowing with mutual esteem the whales salute more hominum,melville-moby_dick
it is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert to seek to hamstring him as it were by sundering or maiming his gigantic tail tendon,melville-moby_dick
so that tormented to madness he was now churning through the water violently flailing with his flexible tail and tossing the keen spade about him wounding and murdering his own comrades,melville-moby_dick
instantly starbuck and queequeg changed places starbuck taking the stern,melville-moby_dick
shove him off you queequeg the whale there prick him hit him,melville-moby_dick
after many similar hair breadth escapes we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles but now crossed by random whales all violently making for one centre,melville-moby_dick
the result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the fishery the more whales the less fish,melville-moby_dick
the previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of sperm whales and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those vast aggregations,melville-moby_dick
in truth this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman swimming about over the watery world surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem,melville-moby_dick
like fashionables they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety,melville-moby_dick
high times indeed if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss though do what the bashaw will he cannot keep the most notorious lothario out of his bed for alas,melville-moby_dick
but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harem s lord then is it very diverting to watch that lord,melville-moby_dick
in good time nevertheless as the ardour of youth declines as years and dumps increase as reflection lends her solemn pauses in short as a general lassitude overtakes the sated turk then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens our ottoman enters upon the impotent repentant admonitory stage of life forswears disbands the harem and grown to an exemplary sulky old soul goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers and warning each young leviathan from his amorous errors,melville-moby_dick
almost universally a lone whale as a solitary leviathan is called proves an ancient one,melville-moby_dick
like a mob of young collegians they are full of fight fun and wickedness tumbling round the world at such a reckless rollicking rate that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at yale or harvard,melville-moby_dick
but strike a member of the harem school and her companions swim around her with every token of concern sometimes lingering so near her and so long as themselves to fall a prey,melville-moby_dick
for example after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and drifting far away to leeward be retaken by a second whaler who in a calm snugly tows it alongside without risk of life or line,melville-moby_dick
they have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses justinian s pandects and the by laws of the chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other people s business,melville-moby_dick
a loose fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it,melville-moby_dick
these are scientific commentaries but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks the coke upon littleton of the fist,melville-moby_dick
and when those defendants were remonstrated with their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs teeth and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done he would now retain their line harpoons and boat which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure,melville-moby_dick
case wherein a gentleman after in vain trying to bridle his wife s viciousness had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life but in the course of years repenting of that step he instituted an action to recover possession of her,melville-moby_dick
a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge might possibly object to it,melville-moby_dick
what to the rapacious landlord is the widow s last mite but a fast fish,melville-moby_dick
what to that redoubted harpooneer john bull is poor ireland but a fast fish,melville-moby_dick
what was america in 1492 but a loose fish in which columbus struck the spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress,melville-moby_dick
all loose fish,melville-moby_dick
what is the great globe itself but a loose fish,melville-moby_dick
bracton l 3 c 3,melville-moby_dick
it seems that some honest mariners of dover or sandwich or some one of the cinque ports had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore,melville-moby_dick
because the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them,melville-moby_dick
but that did in nowise mend the matter or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of blackstone,melville-moby_dick
it is his,melville-moby_dick
i thought to relieve my old bed ridden mother by part of my share of this whale,melville-moby_dick
thinking that viewed in some particular lights the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed under the circumstances a rather hard one an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration,melville-moby_dick
the law itself has already been set forth,melville-moby_dick
a reason for that ye lawyers,melville-moby_dick
an allegorical meaning may lurk here,melville-moby_dick
the pequod meets the rose bud,melville-moby_dick
i will bet something now said stubb that somewhere hereabouts are some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day,melville-moby_dick
so intolerable indeed is it regarded by some that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it,melville-moby_dick
the pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger that stubb vowed he recognised his cutting spade pole entangled in the lines that were knotted round the tail of one of these whales,melville-moby_dick
for what oil he ll get from that drugged whale there wouldn t be fit to burn in a jail no not in a condemned cell,melville-moby_dick
by this time the faint air had become a complete calm so that whether or no the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again,melville-moby_dick
a wooden rose bud eh,melville-moby_dick
yes rejoined a guernsey man from the bulwarks who turned out to be the chief mate,melville-moby_dick
cachalot blanche,melville-moby_dick
upon which ahab retired and stubb returned to the frenchman,melville-moby_dick
i wish it was broken or that i didn t have any nose at all,melville-moby_dick
fine day ain t it,melville-moby_dick
keep cool cool,melville-moby_dick
i know that well enough but d ye see the captain here won t believe it this is his first voyage he was a cologne manufacturer before,melville-moby_dick
but they worked rather slow and talked very fast and seemed in anything but a good humor,melville-moby_dick
stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the captain s round house abaft and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door which was held ajar from within,melville-moby_dick
according to this little plan of theirs the guernsey man under cover of an interpreter s office was to tell the captain what he pleased but as coming from stubb and as for stubb he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview,melville-moby_dick
said he,melville-moby_dick
said the guernsey man to stubb,melville-moby_dick
what now,melville-moby_dick
he wants you to take a glass of wine with him said the interpreter,melville-moby_dick
while the frenchman s boats then were engaged in towing the ship one way stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long tow line,melville-moby_dick
his boat s crew were all in high excitement eagerly helping their chief and looking as anxious as gold hunters,melville-moby_dick
dropping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe windsor soap or rich mottled old cheese very unctuous and savory withal,melville-moby_dick
ambergris,melville-moby_dick
besides amber is a hard transparent brittle odorless substance used for mouth pieces to pipes for beads and ornaments but ambergris is soft waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that it is largely used in perfumery in pastiles precious candles hair powders and pomatum,melville-moby_dick
by some ambergris is supposed to be the cause and by others the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale,melville-moby_dick
and likewise call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk,melville-moby_dick
they hint that all whales always smell bad,melville-moby_dick
i partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland in former times of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg which latter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack in his great work on smells a text book on that subject,melville-moby_dick
nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant when as a general thing he enjoys such high health taking abundance of exercise always out of doors though it is true seldom in the open air,melville-moby_dick
the castaway,melville-moby_dick
but if there happen to be an unduly slender clumsy or timorous wight in the ship that wight is certain to be made a ship keeper,melville-moby_dick
but while hapless dough boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects pip though over tender hearted was at bottom very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer freer relish than any other race,melville-moby_dick
so though in the clear air of day suspended against a blue veined neck the pure watered diamond drop will healthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre he lays it against a gloomy ground and then lights it up not by the sun but by some unnatural gases,melville-moby_dick
now upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and as the fish received the darted iron it gave its customary rap which happened in this instance to be right under poor pip s seat,melville-moby_dick
he was full of the fire of the hunt,melville-moby_dick
in less than half a minute this entire thing happened,melville-moby_dick
the substance was never jump from a boat pip except but all the rest was indefinite as the soundest advice ever is,melville-moby_dick
hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted that though man loved his fellow yet man is a money making animal which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence,melville-moby_dick
it was a beautiful bounteous blue day the spangled sea calm and cool and flatly stretching away all round to the horizon like gold beater s skin hammered out to the extremest,melville-moby_dick
out from the centre of the sea poor pip turned his crisp curling black head to the sun another lonely castaway though the loftiest and the brightest,melville-moby_dick
mark how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea mark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides,melville-moby_dick
by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot such at least they said he was,melville-moby_dick
so man s insanity is heaven s sense and wandering from all mortal reason man comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and frantic and weal or woe feels then uncompromised indifferent as his god,melville-moby_dick
that whale of stubb s so dearly purchased was duly brought to the pequod s side where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed were regularly gone through even to the baling of the heidelburgh tun or case,melville-moby_dick
no wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic,melville-moby_dick
after having my hands in it for only a few minutes my fingers felt like eels and began as it were to serpentine and spiralise,melville-moby_dick
all the morning long i squeezed that sperm till i myself almost melted into it i squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me and i found myself unwittingly squeezing my co laborers hands in it mistaking their hands for the gentle globules,melville-moby_dick
for now since by many prolonged repeated experiences i have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower or at least shift his conceit of attainable felicity not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy but in the wife the heart the bed the table the saddle the fireside the country now that i have perceived all this i am ready to squeeze case eternally,melville-moby_dick
after being severed from the whale the white horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer,melville-moby_dick
it is plums of rubies in pictures of citron,melville-moby_dick
it is called slobgollion an appellation original with the whalemen and even so is the nature of the substance,melville-moby_dick
nippers,melville-moby_dick
but to learn all about these recondite matters your best way is at once to descend into the blubber room and have a long talk with its inmates,melville-moby_dick
the whaling pike is similar to a frigate s boarding weapon of the same name,melville-moby_dick
if he cuts off one of his own toes or one of his assistants would you be very much astonished,melville-moby_dick
not the wondrous cistern in the whale s huge head not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none of these would so surprise you as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone longer than a kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jet black as yojo the ebony idol of queequeg,melville-moby_dick
this done he turns the pelt inside out like a pantaloon leg gives it a good stretching so as almost to double its diameter and at last hangs it well spread in the rigging to dry,melville-moby_dick
arrayed in decent black occupying a conspicuous pulpit intent on bible leaves what a candidate for an archbishopric what a lad for a pope were this mincer,melville-moby_dick
it enjoins him to be careful and cut his work into as thin slices as possible inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated and its quantity considerably increased besides perhaps improving it in quality,melville-moby_dick
it is as if from the open field a brick kiln were transported to her planks,melville-moby_dick
removing this hatch we expose the great try pots two in number and each of several barrels capacity,melville-moby_dick
it is a place also for profound mathematical meditation,melville-moby_dick
by a tunnel inserted at the rear this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates,melville-moby_dick
all ready there,melville-moby_dick
after that no wood is used except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel,melville-moby_dick
for his smoke is horrible to inhale and inhale it you must and not only that but you must live in it for the time,melville-moby_dick
but that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging as with the famed greek fire,melville-moby_dick
with huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots or stirred up the fires beneath till the snaky flames darted curling out of the doors to catch them by the feet,melville-moby_dick
here lounged the watch when not otherwise employed looking into the red heat of the fire till their eyes felt scorched in their heads,melville-moby_dick
the continual sight of the fiend shapes before me capering half in smoke and half in fire these at last begat kindred visions in my soul so soon as i began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm,melville-moby_dick
nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness,melville-moby_dick
what is the matter with me,melville-moby_dick
how glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee,melville-moby_dick
nevertheless the sun hides not virginia s dismal swamp nor rome s accursed campagna nor wide sahara nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon,melville-moby_dick
all is vanity,melville-moby_dick
give not thyself up then to fire lest it invert thee deaden thee as for the time it did me,melville-moby_dick
the lamp,melville-moby_dick
but the whaleman as he seeks the food of light so he lives in light,melville-moby_dick
he goes and hunts for his oil so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game,melville-moby_dick
while still warm the oil like hot punch is received into the six barrel casks and while perhaps the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over end for end and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck like so many land slides till at last man handled and stayed in their course and all round the hoops rap rap go as many hammers as can play upon them for now ex officio every sailor is a cooper,melville-moby_dick
but a day or two after you look about you and prick your ears in this self same ship and were it not for the tell tale boats and try works you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel with a most scrupulously neat commander,melville-moby_dick
the soot is brushed from the lower rigging,melville-moby_dick
they know not the thing you distantly allude to,melville-moby_dick
oh,melville-moby_dick
the metempsychosis,melville-moby_dick
ere now it has been related how ahab was wont to pace his quarter deck taking regular turns at either limit the binnacle and mainmast but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks when most plunged in his mood he was wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him,melville-moby_dick
and though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes yet untouchable and immaculate to any foulness it still preserved its quito glow,melville-moby_dick
here palms alpacas and volcanoes sun s disks and stars ecliptics horns of plenty and rich banners waving are in luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories by passing through those fancy mints so spanishly poetic,melville-moby_dick
before this equatorial coin ahab not unobserved by others was now pausing,melville-moby_dick
aye he enters the sign of storms the equinox,melville-moby_dick
so be it then,melville-moby_dick
i have never marked the coin inspectingly,melville-moby_dick
yet oh the great sun is no fixture and if at midnight we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him we gaze for him in vain,melville-moby_dick
humph,melville-moby_dick
let me read it once,melville-moby_dick
here s the book,melville-moby_dick
well the sun he wheels among em,melville-moby_dick
that s my small experience so far as the massachusetts calendar and bowditch s navigator and daboll s arithmetic go,melville-moby_dick
look you doubloon your zodiac here is the life of man in one round chapter and now i ll read it off straight out of the book,melville-moby_dick
how we suddenly jump as scorpio or the scorpion stings us in the rear we are curing the wound when whang come the arrows all round sagittarius or the archer is amusing himself,melville-moby_dick
oh jolly s the word for aye,melville-moby_dick
i see nothing here but a round thing made of gold and whoever raises a certain whale this round thing belongs to him,melville-moby_dick
but avast here comes our old manxman the old hearse driver he must have been that is before he took to the sea,melville-moby_dick
if the white whale be raised it must be in a month and a day when the sun stands in some one of these signs,melville-moby_dick
the lion is the horse shoe sign the roaring and devouring lion,melville-moby_dick
dodge again,melville-moby_dick
no he don t know what to make of the doubloon he takes it for an old button off some king s trowsers,melville-moby_dick
ho,melville-moby_dick
stand away again and hear him,melville-moby_dick
but what s that he says now hist,melville-moby_dick
well that s funny,melville-moby_dick
caw,melville-moby_dick
there he stands two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers and two more poked into the sleeves of an old jacket,melville-moby_dick
here s the ship s navel this doubloon here and they are all on fire to unscrew it,melville-moby_dick
the white whale he ll nail ye,melville-moby_dick
oh the gold,melville-moby_dick
god goes mong the worlds blackberrying,melville-moby_dick
hey hey hey hey hey jenny jenny,melville-moby_dick
ship ahoy,melville-moby_dick
hast seen the white whale,melville-moby_dick
in less than a minute without quitting his little craft he and his crew were dropped to the water and were soon alongside of the stranger,melville-moby_dick
it has before been hinted perhaps that every little untoward circumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab,melville-moby_dick
this was quickly lowered to ahab who at once comprehending it all slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then giving the word held himself fast and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight by pulling hand over hand upon one of the running parts of the tackle,melville-moby_dick
the white whale said the englishman pointing his ivory arm towards the east and taking a rueful sight along it as if it had been a telescope there i saw him on the line last season,melville-moby_dick
it was the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line began the englishman,melville-moby_dick
cried ahab suddenly letting out his suspended breath,melville-moby_dick
aye i see wanted to part it free the fast fish an old trick i know him,melville-moby_dick
but lord look you sir hearts and souls alive man the next instant in a jiff i was blind as a bat both eyes out all befogged and bedeadened with black foam the whale s tail looming straight up out of it perpendicular in the air like a marble steeple,melville-moby_dick
now bunger boy spin your part of the yarn,melville-moby_dick
samuel enderby is the name of my ship interrupted the one armed captain addressing ahab go on boy,melville-moby_dick
oh ye stars,melville-moby_dick
why don t ye,melville-moby_dick
water,melville-moby_dick
in short it grew black i knew what was threatened and off it came,melville-moby_dick
oh you solemn rogue you you bunger,melville-moby_dick
oh,melville-moby_dick
but could not fasten,melville-moby_dick
do you know gentlemen very gravely and mathematically bowing to each captain in succession do you know gentlemen that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine providence that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a man s arm,melville-moby_dick
no possible way for him to digest that jack knife and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system,melville-moby_dick
glancing at the ivory leg,melville-moby_dick
how long since thou saw st him last,melville-moby_dick
roared ahab dashing him against the bulwarks man the boat,melville-moby_dick
he was heading east i think is your captain crazy,melville-moby_dick
with back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own ahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod,melville-moby_dick
be it distinctly recorded here that the nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm whale and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him,melville-moby_dick
but this is not all,melville-moby_dick
the ship named after him was worthy of the honour being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way,melville-moby_dick
flip,melville-moby_dick
they said it was bull beef others that it was dromedary beef but i do not know for certain how that was,melville-moby_dick
but the forecastle was not very light and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it,melville-moby_dick
nor have i been at all sparing of historical whale research when it has seemed needed,melville-moby_dick
the title was dan coopman wherefore i concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdam cooper in the fishery as every whale ship must carry its cooper,melville-moby_dick
400 000 lbs,melville-moby_dick
of stock fish,melville-moby_dick
2 800 firkins of butter,melville-moby_dick
550 ankers of geneva,melville-moby_dick
i impute it though to their naturally unctuous natures being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid polar seas on the very coasts of that esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil,melville-moby_dick
but this was very far north be it remembered where beer agrees well with the constitution upon the equator in our southern fishery beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast head and boozy in his boat and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford,melville-moby_dick
a bower in the arsacides,melville-moby_dick
did erudite stubb mounted upon your capstan deliver lectures on the anatomy of the cetacea and by help of the windlass hold up a specimen rib for exhibition,melville-moby_dick
i confess that since jonah few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless i have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature,melville-moby_dick
among many other fine qualities my royal friend tranquo being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu had brought together in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices chiselled shells inlaid spears costly paddles aromatic canoes and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders the wonder freighted tribute rendering waves had cast upon his shores,melville-moby_dick
the wood was green as mosses of the icy glen the trees stood high and haughty feeling their living sap the industrious earth beneath was as a weaver s loom with a gorgeous carpet on it whereof the ground vine tendrils formed the warp and woof and the living flowers the figures,melville-moby_dick
what palace may it deck,melville-moby_dick
for even so it is in all material factories,melville-moby_dick
now amid the green life restless loom of that arsacidean wood the great white worshipped skeleton lay lounging a gigantic idler,melville-moby_dick
but more i marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine,melville-moby_dick
from their arrow slit in the skull the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib how now,melville-moby_dick
these admeasurements i now propose to set before you,melville-moby_dick
moreover at a place in yorkshire england burton constable by name a certain sir clifford constable has in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale but of moderate size by no means of the full grown magnitude of my friend king tranquo s,melville-moby_dick
sir clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead,melville-moby_dick
in the first place i wish to lay before you a particular plain statement touching the living bulk of this leviathan whose skeleton we are briefly to exhibit,melville-moby_dick
but as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton as it is by far the most complicated part and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter you must not fail to carry it in your mind or under your arm as we proceed otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view,melville-moby_dick
the ribs were ten on a side,melville-moby_dick
in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams,melville-moby_dick
besides for some way where i now saw but a naked spine all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh muscle blood and bowels,melville-moby_dick
but the spine,melville-moby_dick
they mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a gothic spire forming solid courses of heavy masonry,melville-moby_dick
chapter 104,melville-moby_dick
not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail and the yards he measures about the waist only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop deck of a line of battle ship,melville-moby_dick
fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary,melville-moby_dick
give me a condor s quill,melville-moby_dick
we expand to its bulk,melville-moby_dick
and though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects to justify their taking rank as cetacean fossils,melville-moby_dick
the awe stricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels,melville-moby_dick
when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons skulls tusks jaws ribs and vertebrae all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of sea monsters but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical leviathans their incalculable seniors i am by a flood borne back to that wondrous period ere time itself can be said to have begun for time began with man,melville-moby_dick
methuselah seems a school boy,melville-moby_dick
gliding among them old leviathan swam as of yore was there swimming in that planisphere centuries before solomon was cradled,melville-moby_dick
they keep a whale s rib of an incredible length for a miracle which lying upon the ground with its convex part uppermost makes an arch the head of which cannot be reached by a man upon a camel s back,melville-moby_dick
does the whale s magnitude diminish will he perish,melville-moby_dick
and i have heard on whalemen s authority that sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture,melville-moby_dick
and lacepede the french naturalist in his elaborate history of whales in the very beginning of his work page 3 sets down the right whale at one hundred metres three hundred and twenty eight feet,melville-moby_dick
and if ever i go where pliny is i a whaleman more than he was will make bold to tell him so,melville-moby_dick
but you must look at this matter in every light,melville-moby_dick
because as has been elsewhere noticed those whales influenced by some views to safety now swim the seas in immense caravans so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries yokes and pods and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated unfrequent armies,melville-moby_dick
and as upon the invasion of their valleys the frosty swiss have retreated to their mountains so hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas the whale bone whales can at last resort to their polar citadels and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there come up among icy fields and floes and in a charmed circle of everlasting december bid defiance to all pursuit from man,melville-moby_dick
moreover we are to consider that from the presumed great longevity of whales their probably attaining the age of a century and more therefore at any one period of time several distinct adult generations must be contemporary,melville-moby_dick
chapter 106,melville-moby_dick
and indeed it seemed small matter for wonder that for all his pervading mad recklessness ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood,melville-moby_dick
for thought ahab while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them but at bottom all heartwoes a mystic significance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do their diligent tracings out not belie the obvious deduction,melville-moby_dick
captain peleg s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate though indeed as touching all ahab s deeper part every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light,melville-moby_dick
but be all this as it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire have to do or not with earthly ahab yet in this present matter of his leg he took plain practical procedures he called the carpenter,melville-moby_dick
the carpenter,melville-moby_dick
but besides the application to him of the generic remark above this carpenter of the pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship upon a three or four years voyage in uncivilized and far distant seas,melville-moby_dick
a lost land bird of strange plumage strays on board and is made a captive out of clean shaved rods of right whale bone and cross beams of sperm whale ivory the carpenter makes a pagoda looking cage for it,melville-moby_dick
thus this carpenter was prepared at all points and alike indifferent and without respect in all,melville-moby_dick
yet was this half horrible stolidity in him involving too as it appeared an all ramifying heartlessness yet was it oddly dashed at times with an old crutch like antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of noah s ark,melville-moby_dick
he was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful multum in parvo sheffield contrivances assuming the exterior though a little swelled of a common pocket knife but containing not only blades of various sizes but also screw drivers cork screws tweezers awls pens rulers nail filers countersinkers,melville-moby_dick
but there it was and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more,melville-moby_dick
carpenter standing before his vice bench and by the light of two lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg which joist is firmly fixed in the vice,melville-moby_dick
so we go who file old jaws and shinbones,melville-moby_dick
saw a live tree and you don t get this dust amputate a live bone and you don t get it sneezes,melville-moby_dick
they soak water they do and of course get rheumatic and have to be doctored sneezes with washes and lotions just like live legs,melville-moby_dick
during the ensuing scene the carpenter continues sneezing at times,melville-moby_dick
measured for a leg,melville-moby_dick
this is a cogent vice thou hast here carpenter let me feel its grip once,melville-moby_dick
he must be forging the buckle screw sir now,melville-moby_dick
um m,melville-moby_dick
carpenter when he s through with that buckle tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulder blades there s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack,melville-moby_dick
there take the order and away,melville-moby_dick
no no no i must have a lantern,melville-moby_dick
thrusted light is worse than presented pistols,melville-moby_dick
clay sir,melville-moby_dick
take the hint then and when thou art dead never bury thyself under living people s noses,melville-moby_dick
canst thou not drive that old adam away,melville-moby_dick
look put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was so now here is only one distinct leg to the eye yet two to the soul,melville-moby_dick
how dost thou know that some entire living thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest aye and standing there in thy spite,melville-moby_dick
good lord,melville-moby_dick
oh life,melville-moby_dick
by heavens,melville-moby_dick
stubb knows him best of all and stubb always says he s queer says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer he s queer says stubb he s queer queer queer and keeps dinning it into mr starbuck all the time queer sir queer queer very queer,melville-moby_dick
what was that now about one leg standing in three places and all three places standing in one hell how was that,melville-moby_dick
and here s the heron s leg,melville-moby_dick
halloa there you smut,melville-moby_dick
i almost forgot the little oval slate smoothed ivory where he figures up the latitude,melville-moby_dick
no inconsiderable oil came up with the water the casks below must have sprung a bad leak,melville-moby_dick
now from the south and west the pequod was drawing nigh to formosa and the bashee isles between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the china waters into the pacific,melville-moby_dick
on deck,melville-moby_dick
up burtons and break out,melville-moby_dick
i was speaking of the oil in the hold sir,melville-moby_dick
aye,melville-moby_dick
i ll not have the burtons hoisted,melville-moby_dick
thou art always prating to me starbuck about those miserly owners as if the owners were my conscience,melville-moby_dick
nay sir not yet i do entreat,melville-moby_dick
but mastering his emotion he half calmly rose and as he quitted the cabin paused for an instant and said thou hast outraged not insulted me sir but for that i ask thee not to beware of starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let ahab beware of ahab beware of thyself old man,melville-moby_dick
thou art but too good a fellow starbuck he said lowly to the mate then raising his voice to the crew furl the t gallant sails and close reef the top sails fore and aft back the main yard up burton and break out in the main hold,melville-moby_dick
queequeg in his coffin,melville-moby_dick
top heavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all aristotle in his head,melville-moby_dick
to be short among whalemen the harpooneers are the holders so called,melville-moby_dick
but as all else in him thinned and his cheek bones grew sharper his eyes nevertheless seemed growing fuller and fuller they became of a strange softness of lustre and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die or be weakened,melville-moby_dick
so that let us say it again no dying chaldee or greek had higher and holier thoughts than those whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor queequeg as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest and the ocean s invisible flood tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven,melville-moby_dick
now when this strange circumstance was made known aft the carpenter was at once commanded to do queequeg s bidding whatever it might include,melville-moby_dick
he ll have to die now ejaculated the long island sailor,melville-moby_dick
leaning over in his hammock queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye,melville-moby_dick
the head part turned over with a leather hinge and there lay queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view,melville-moby_dick
where go ye now,melville-moby_dick
rig a dig dig dig,melville-moby_dick
he speaks again but more wildly now,melville-moby_dick
huzza,melville-moby_dick
hark ye if ye find pip tell all the antilles he s a runaway a coward a coward a coward,melville-moby_dick
let em go drown like pip that jumped from a whale boat,melville-moby_dick
but now that he had apparently made every preparation for death now that his coffin was proved a good fit queequeg suddenly rallied soon there seemed no need of the carpenter s box and thereupon when some expressed their delighted surprise he in substance said that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this at a critical moment he had just recalled a little duty ashore which he was leaving undone and therefore had changed his mind about dying he could not die yet he averred,melville-moby_dick
so in good time my queequeg gained strength and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days but eating with a vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his feet threw out his arms and legs gave himself a good stretching yawned a little bit and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoon pronounced himself fit for a fight,melville-moby_dick
chapter 111,melville-moby_dick
to any meditative magian rover this serene pacific once beheld must ever after be the sea of his adoption,melville-moby_dick
but few thoughts of pan stirred ahab s brain as standing like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the bashee isles in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea that sea in which the hated white whale must even then be swimming,melville-moby_dick
the blacksmith,melville-moby_dick
silent slow and solemn bowing over still further his chronically broken back he toiled away as if toil were life itself and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart,melville-moby_dick
the issue was the loss of the extremities of both feet,melville-moby_dick
and darker yet to tell the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his family s heart,melville-moby_dick
oh death why canst thou not sometimes be timely,melville-moby_dick
death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this but death is only a launching into the region of the strange untried it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense remote the wild the watery the unshored therefore to the death longing eyes of such men who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide does the all contributed and all receptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable taking terrors and wonderful new life adventures and from the hearts of infinite pacifics the thousand mermaids sing to them come hither broken hearted here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death here are wonders supernatural without dying for them,melville-moby_dick
hearkening to these voices east and west by early sunrise and by fall of eve the blacksmith s soul responded aye i come,melville-moby_dick
while yet a little distance from the forge moody ahab paused till at last perth withdrawing his iron from the fire began hammering it upon the anvil the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights some of which flew close to ahab,melville-moby_dick
thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly sanely woeful to me,melville-moby_dick
welding an old pike head sir there were seams and dents in it,melville-moby_dick
look ye here then cried ahab passionately advancing and leaning with both hands on perth s shoulders look ye here here can ye smoothe out a seam like this blacksmith sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow if thou could st blacksmith glad enough would i lay my head upon thy anvil and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes,melville-moby_dick
said i not all seams and dents but one,melville-moby_dick
i too want a harpoon made one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part perth something that will stick in a whale like his own fin bone,melville-moby_dick
i know it old man these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers,melville-moby_dick
i ll blow the fire,melville-moby_dick
this done perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one when ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron,melville-moby_dick
that parsee smells fire like a fusee and smells of it himself like a hot musket s powder pan,melville-moby_dick
is not this harpoon for the white whale,melville-moby_dick
take them man i have no need for them for i now neither shave sup nor pray till but here to work,melville-moby_dick
what say ye pagans,melville-moby_dick
ego non baptizo te in nomine patris sed in nomine diaboli,melville-moby_dick
and now for the seizings,melville-moby_dick
thy wretched laugh thy idle but unresting eye all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship and mocked it,melville-moby_dick
at such times under an abated sun afloat all day upon smooth slow heaving swells seated in his boat light as a birch canoe and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves that like hearth stone cats they purr against the gunwale these are the times of dreamy quietude when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the ocean s skin one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it and would not willingly remember that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang,melville-moby_dick
but if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing,melville-moby_dick
there is no steady unretracing progress in this life we do not advance through fixed gradations and at the last one pause through infancy s unconscious spell boyhood s thoughtless faith adolescence doubt the common doom then scepticism then disbelief resting at last in manhood s pondering repose of if,melville-moby_dick
our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them the secret of our paternity lies in their grave and we must there to learn it,melville-moby_dick
i am stubb and stubb has his history but here stubb takes oaths that he has always been jolly,melville-moby_dick
the three men at her mast head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats from the stern a whale boat was suspended bottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain,melville-moby_dick
even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindling wood and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oil butt lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece,melville-moby_dick
you would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed bastille such wild cries they raised as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea,melville-moby_dick
hast seen the white whale,melville-moby_dick
sail on,melville-moby_dick
how wondrous familiar is a fool,melville-moby_dick
and thus while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze the other stubbornly fought against it and so the two vessels parted the crew of the pequod looking with grave lingering glances towards the receding bachelor but the bachelor s men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in,melville-moby_dick
so seemed it with the pequod,melville-moby_dick
he turns and turns him to it how slowly but how steadfastly his homage rendering and invoking brow with his last dying motions,melville-moby_dick
oh thou dark hindoo half of nature who of drowned bones hast builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas thou art an infidel thou queen and too truly speakest to me in the wide slaughtering typhoon and the hushed burial of its after calm,melville-moby_dick
yet dost thou darker half rock me with a prouder if a darker faith,melville-moby_dick
the whale watch,melville-moby_dick
a sound like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of gomorrah ran shuddering through the air,melville-moby_dick
and who are hearsed that die on the sea,melville-moby_dick
such a sight we shall not soon see,melville-moby_dick
well then did i believe all ye say oh my pilot,melville-moby_dick
the grey dawn came on and the slumbering crew arose from the boat s bottom and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship,melville-moby_dick
it was hard upon high noon and ahab seated in the bows of his high hoisted boat was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude,melville-moby_dick
so swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship and with his astrological looking instrument placed to his eye he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian,melville-moby_dick
thou tellest me truly where i am but canst thou cast the least hint where i shall be,melville-moby_dick
then gazing at his quadrant and handling one after the other its numerous cabalistical contrivances he pondered again and muttered foolish toy,melville-moby_dick
curse thee thou vain toy and cursed be all the things that cast man s eyes aloft to that heaven whose live vividness but scorches him as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light o sun,melville-moby_dick
as the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet a sneering triumph that seemed meant for ahab and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself these passed over the mute motionless parsee s face,melville-moby_dick
i have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow full of its tormented flaming life and i have seen it wane at last down down to dumbest dust,melville-moby_dick
and damn me ahab but thou actest right live in the game and die in it,melville-moby_dick
so too it is that in these resplendent japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms the typhoon,melville-moby_dick
but all their pains seemed naught,melville-moby_dick
stubb for one can t fight it,melville-moby_dick
jolly is the gale and a joker is the whale a flourishin his tail such a funny sporty gamy jesty joky hoky poky lad is the ocean oh,melville-moby_dick
and i tell you what it is mr starbuck there s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat,melville-moby_dick
how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else never mind how foolish,melville-moby_dick
in the stern sheets man where he is wont to stand his stand point is stove man,melville-moby_dick
yonder to windward all is blackness of doom but to leeward homeward i see it lightens up there but not with the lightning,melville-moby_dick
now as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast is intended to conduct it into the water,melville-moby_dick
are they overboard,melville-moby_dick
yet i ll contribute to raise rods on the himmalehs and andes that all the world may be secured but out on privileges,melville-moby_dick
the corpusants,melville-moby_dick
blast it,melville-moby_dick
the parted mouth of tashtego revealed his shark white teeth which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants while lit up by the preternatural light queequeg s tattooing burned like satanic blue flames on his body,melville-moby_dick
no no it wasn t i said the corpusants have mercy on us all and i hope they will still,melville-moby_dick
at that moment starbuck caught sight of stubb s face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight,melville-moby_dick
at the base of the mainmast full beneath the doubloon and the flame the parsee was kneeling in ahab s front but with his head bowed away from him while near by from the arched and overhanging rigging where they had just been engaged securing a spar a number of the seamen arrested by the glare now cohered together and hung pendulous like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping orchard twig,melville-moby_dick
hand me those mainmast links there i would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat against it blood against fire,melville-moby_dick
to neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind and e en for hate thou canst but kill and all are killed,melville-moby_dick
but war is pain and hate is woe,melville-moby_dick
nor was it wrung from me nor do i now drop these links,melville-moby_dick
the lightning flashes through my skull mine eye balls ache and ache my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded and rolling on some stunning ground,melville-moby_dick
there burn the flames,melville-moby_dick
what hast thou done with her,melville-moby_dick
through thee thy flaming self my scorched eyes do dimly see it,melville-moby_dick
i leap with thee i burn with thee would fain be welded with thee defyingly i worship thee,melville-moby_dick
as the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent s tongue starbuck grasped ahab by the arm god god is against thee old man forbear,melville-moby_dick
but dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck and snatching the burning harpoon ahab waved it like a torch among them swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope s end,melville-moby_dick
as in the hurricane that sweeps the plain men fly the neighborhood of some lone gigantic elm whose very height and strength but render it so much the more unsafe because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts so at those last words of ahab s many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay,melville-moby_dick
we must send down the main top sail yard sir,melville-moby_dick
sir in god s name sir,melville-moby_dick
the wind rises but it has not got up to my table lands yet,melville-moby_dick
loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds and this brain truck of mine now sails amid the cloud scud,melville-moby_dick
oh take medicine take medicine,melville-moby_dick
and how long ago is it since you said the very contrary,melville-moby_dick
i ve part changed my flesh since that time why not my mind,melville-moby_dick
here are hydrants flask,melville-moby_dick
what are you talking about then,melville-moby_dick
any man with half an eye can be sensible,melville-moby_dick
never mind catch the turn there and pass it,melville-moby_dick
what a hold they have too,melville-moby_dick
thank ye,melville-moby_dick
halloa,melville-moby_dick
midnight aloft thunder and lightning,melville-moby_dick
what s the use of thunder,melville-moby_dick
the musket,melville-moby_dick
the three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed and a storm trysail was set further aft so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again and the course for the present east south east which he was to steer if practicable was once more given to the helmsman,melville-moby_dick
instantly the yards were squared to the lively song of ho,melville-moby_dick
ere knocking at his state room he involuntarily paused before it a moment,melville-moby_dick
he would have shot me once he murmured yes there s the very musket that he pointed at me that one with the studded stock let me touch it lift it,melville-moby_dick
best spill it wait,melville-moby_dick
it s a fair wind that s only fair for that accursed fish the very tube he pointed at me the very one this one i hold it here he would have killed me with the very thing i handle now aye and he would fain kill all his crew,melville-moby_dick
but shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship s company down to doom with him yes it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm my soul swears this ship will if ahab have his way,melville-moby_dick
sleeping,melville-moby_dick
aye and say st the men have vow d thy vow say st all of us are ahabs,melville-moby_dick
only a fool would try it,melville-moby_dick
i stand alone here upon an open sea with two oceans and a whole continent between me and law aye aye tis so is heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a would be murderer in his bed tindering sheets and skin together and would i be a murderer then if and slowly stealthily and half sideways looking he placed the loaded musket s end against the door,melville-moby_dick
boy but if i wake thee not to death old man who can tell to what unsounded deeps starbuck s body this day week may sink with all the crew,melville-moby_dick
oh moby dick i clutch thy heart at last,melville-moby_dick
thou know st what to say,melville-moby_dick
muffled in the full morning light the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks,melville-moby_dick
thou mightest well be taken now for the sea chariot of the sun,melville-moby_dick
but suddenly reined back by some counter thought he hurried towards the helm huskily demanding how the ship was heading,melville-moby_dick
upon this every soul was confounded for the phenomenon just then observed by ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else but its very blinding palpableness must have been the cause,melville-moby_dick
it has happened before,melville-moby_dick
the magnetic energy as developed in the mariner s needle is as all know essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven hence it is not to be much marvelled at that such things should be,melville-moby_dick
meanwhile whatever were his own secret thoughts starbuck said nothing but quietly he issued all requisite orders while stubb and flask who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced,melville-moby_dick
thou poor proud heaven gazer and sun s pilot,melville-moby_dick
quick,melville-moby_dick
but starbuck looked away,melville-moby_dick
the sun is east and that compass swears it,melville-moby_dick
while now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage the log and line had but very seldom been in use,melville-moby_dick
but heedless of all this his mood seized ahab as he happened to glance upon the reel not many hours after the magnet scene and he remembered how his quadrant was no more and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line,melville-moby_dick
the golden hued tahitian and the grizzly manxman,melville-moby_dick
sir i mistrust it this line looks far gone long heat and wet have spoiled it,melville-moby_dick
i hold the spool sir,melville-moby_dick
where wert thou born,melville-moby_dick
in the isle of man hey,melville-moby_dick
up with it,melville-moby_dick
hold hard,melville-moby_dick
haul in here tahitian reel up manxman,melville-moby_dick
these lines run whole and whirling out come in broken and dragging slow,melville-moby_dick
pip jumped from the whale boat,melville-moby_dick
jerk him off we haul in no cowards here,melville-moby_dick
cut it off we haul in no cowards here,melville-moby_dick
away from the quarter deck,melville-moby_dick
lo,melville-moby_dick
that man should be a thing for immortal souls to sieve through,melville-moby_dick
pip,melville-moby_dick
oh ye frozen heavens,melville-moby_dick
come let s down,melville-moby_dick
oh sir let old perth now come and rivet these two hands together the black one with the white for i will not let this go,melville-moby_dick
see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man and man though idiotic and knowing not what he does yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude,melville-moby_dick
but here s the end of the rotten line all dripping too,melville-moby_dick
the life buoy,melville-moby_dick
yet the grey manxman the oldest mariner of all declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea,melville-moby_dick
in the sea under certain circumstances seals have more than once been mistaken for men,melville-moby_dick
but few perhaps thought of that at the time,melville-moby_dick
a life buoy of a coffin,melville-moby_dick
rig it carpenter do not look at me so the coffin i mean,melville-moby_dick
aye,melville-moby_dick
moving his hand as with a pitch pot,melville-moby_dick
he goes off in a huff,melville-moby_dick
and now i m ordered to make a life buoy of it,melville-moby_dick
it s the old woman s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs,melville-moby_dick
but heigh ho,melville-moby_dick
some superstitious old carpenters now would be tied up in the rigging ere they would do the job,melville-moby_dick
we workers in woods make bridal bedsteads and card tables as well as coffins and hearses,melville-moby_dick
but i ve forgotten,melville-moby_dick
chapter 127,melville-moby_dick
not this hand complies with my humor more genially than that boy middle aisle of a church,melville-moby_dick
beware the hatchway,melville-moby_dick
oh,melville-moby_dick
well enough,melville-moby_dick
but i do not mean anything sir,melville-moby_dick
dost thou never,melville-moby_dick
hark to it,melville-moby_dick
faith,melville-moby_dick
art thou a silk worm,melville-moby_dick
he goes aft,melville-moby_dick
he s looking this way come oakum quick,melville-moby_dick
there s a sound,melville-moby_dick
a most malicious wag that fellow,melville-moby_dick
what things real are there but imponderable thoughts,melville-moby_dick
i ll think of that,melville-moby_dick
now then pip we ll talk this over i do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee,melville-moby_dick
at the time the pequod was making good speed through the water but as the broad winged windward stranger shot nigh to her the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst and all life fled from the smitten hull,melville-moby_dick
have ye seen a whale boat adrift,melville-moby_dick
where was he not killed not killed,melville-moby_dick
in the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water and after that nothing more whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers as often happens,melville-moby_dick
the story told the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal his object in boarding the pequod,melville-moby_dick
my boy my own boy is among them,melville-moby_dick
i take back the coat and watch what says ahab,melville-moby_dick
nor does it unfrequently occur that nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them for a protracted three or four years voyage in some other ship than their own so that their first knowledge of a whaleman s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a father s natural but untimely partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern,melville-moby_dick
avast cried ahab touch not a rope yarn then in a voice that prolongingly moulded every word captain gardiner i will not do it,melville-moby_dick
hurriedly turning with averted face he descended into his cabin leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit,melville-moby_dick
she was rachel weeping for her children because they were not,melville-moby_dick
the hour is coming when ahab would not scare thee from him yet would not have thee by him,melville-moby_dick
no no no,melville-moby_dick
they tell me sir that stubb did once desert poor little pip whose drowned bones now show white for all the blackness of his living skin,melville-moby_dick
oh good master master master,melville-moby_dick
thy hand met,melville-moby_dick
now were even poor pip here i could endure it but he s missing,melville-moby_dick
he must be up here let s try the door,melville-moby_dick
here our old sailors say in their black seventy fours great admirals sometimes sit at table and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants,melville-moby_dick
the epaulets all come crowding,melville-moby_dick
well then fill up again captains and let s drink shame upon all cowards,melville-moby_dick
above there i hear ivory oh master,melville-moby_dick
the hat,melville-moby_dick
stubb no more strove to raise a smile starbuck no more strove to check one,melville-moby_dick
and that shadow was always hovering there,melville-moby_dick
he ate in the same open air that is his two only meals breakfast and dinner supper he never touched nor reaped his beard which darkly grew all gnarled as unearthed roots of trees blown over which still grow idly on at naked base though perished in the upper verdure,melville-moby_dick
and yet somehow did ahab in his own proper self as daily hourly and every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinates ahab seemed an independent lord the parsee but his slave,melville-moby_dick
sharp,melville-moby_dick
ahab must have the doubloon,melville-moby_dick
when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging which chances to afford no foothold the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot and sustained there by the rope under these circumstances its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it,melville-moby_dick
but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have marked it much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight,melville-moby_dick
but only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good,melville-moby_dick
as she drew nigh all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams called shears which in some whaling ships cross the quarter deck at the height of eight or nine feet serving to carry the spare unrigged or disabled boats,melville-moby_dick
hast killed him,melville-moby_dick
then god keep thee old man see st thou that pointing to the hammock i bury but one of five stout men who were alive only yesterday but were dead ere night,melville-moby_dick
brace forward,melville-moby_dick
ha,melville-moby_dick
chapter 132,melville-moby_dick
but though thus contrasting within the contrast was only in shades and shadows without those two seemed one it was only the sex as it were that distinguished them,melville-moby_dick
invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us,melville-moby_dick
but the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel for a moment the cankerous thing in his soul,melville-moby_dick
ahab turned,melville-moby_dick
on such a day very much such a sweetness as this i struck my first whale a boy harpooneer of eighteen,melville-moby_dick
for forty years has ahab forsaken the peaceful land for forty years to make war on the horrors of the deep,melville-moby_dick
wife rather a widow with her husband alive,melville-moby_dick
how the richer or better is ahab now,melville-moby_dick
locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes,melville-moby_dick
god crack my heart stave my brain mockery,melville-moby_dick
by the green land by the bright hearth stone,melville-moby_dick
not with the far away home i see in that eye,melville-moby_dick
why should any one give chase to that hated fish,melville-moby_dick
away,melville-moby_dick
i have seen them some summer days in the morning,melville-moby_dick
no more,melville-moby_dick
the boy s face from the window,melville-moby_dick
is it i god or who that lifts this arm,melville-moby_dick
look,melville-moby_dick
but it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky and the air smells now as if it blew from a far away meadow they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the andes starbuck and the mowers are sleeping among the new mown hay,melville-moby_dick
but blanched to a corpse s hue with despair the mate had stolen away,melville-moby_dick
that night in the mid watch when the old man as his wont at intervals stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned and went to his pivot hole he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship s dog will in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle,melville-moby_dick
call all hands,melville-moby_dick
was the sound hailing down in reply,melville-moby_dick
a hump like a snow hill,melville-moby_dick
to the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit atlantic and indian oceans,melville-moby_dick
i only none of ye could have raised the white whale first,melville-moby_dick
in stunsails,melville-moby_dick
luff luff a point,melville-moby_dick
stand by stand by,melville-moby_dick
stand by the braces,melville-moby_dick
a pale death glimmer lit up fedallah s sunken eyes a hideous motion gnawed his mouth,melville-moby_dick
before it far out on the soft turkish rugged waters went the glistening white shadow from his broad milky forehead a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade and behind the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side,melville-moby_dick
on each soft side coincident with the parted swell that but once leaving him then flowed so wide away on each bright side the whale shed off enticings,melville-moby_dick
but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch like virginia s natural bridge and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air the grand god revealed himself sounded and went out of sight,melville-moby_dick
the breeze now freshened the sea began to swell,melville-moby_dick
but suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying as it rose till it turned and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white glistening teeth floating up from the undiscoverable bottom,melville-moby_dick
but as if perceiving this stratagem moby dick with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him sidelingly transplanted himself as it were in an instant shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat,melville-moby_dick
and now while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way and from his body being submerged beneath the boat he could not be darted at from the bows for the bows were almost inside of him as it were and while the other boats involuntarily paused as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand then it was that monomaniac ahab furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated frenzied with all this he seized the long bone with his naked hands and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe,melville-moby_dick
ripplingly withdrawing from his prey moby dick now lay at a little distance vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose some twenty or more feet out of the water the now rising swells with all their confluent waves dazzlingly broke against it vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air,melville-moby_dick
but soon resuming his horizontal attitude moby dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault,melville-moby_dick
and though the other boats unharmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways ahab and all nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape,melville-moby_dick
as he sullenly swam off the boats flew to the rescue,melville-moby_dick
and so such hearts though summary in each one suffering still if the gods decree it in their life time aggregate a whole age of woe wholly made up of instantaneous intensities for even in their pointless centres those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls,melville-moby_dick
that s good help me man i wish to stand,melville-moby_dick
the eternal sap runs up in ahab s bones again,melville-moby_dick
the ship itself then as it sometimes happens offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase,melville-moby_dick
straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch,melville-moby_dick
ha,melville-moby_dick
aye sir said starbuck drawing near tis a solemn sight an omen and an ill one,melville-moby_dick
cold cold i shiver how now,melville-moby_dick
soon it was almost dark but the look out men still remained unset,melville-moby_dick
he will travel slower now tis night,melville-moby_dick
come down mr,melville-moby_dick
chapter 134,melville-moby_dick
see nothing sir,melville-moby_dick
for such is the wonderful skill prescience of experience and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the nantucket commanders that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried they will under certain given circumstances pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time while out of sight as well as his probable rate of progression during that period,melville-moby_dick
inferable from these statements are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales,melville-moby_dick
some one take me up and launch me spine wise on the sea for by live oaks,melville-moby_dick
was now the mast head cry,melville-moby_dick
and stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew,melville-moby_dick
they were one man not thirty,melville-moby_dick
ah,melville-moby_dick
it was even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistaken some other thing for the whale spout as the event itself soon proved for hardly had ahab reached his perch hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck when he struck the key note to an orchestra that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles,melville-moby_dick
there she breaches,melville-moby_dick
cried ahab thy hour and thy harpoon are at hand down,melville-moby_dick
mr starbuck the ship is thine keep away from the boats but keep near them,melville-moby_dick
but skilfully manoeuvred incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field the boats for a while eluded him though at times but by a plank s breadth while all the time ahab s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds,melville-moby_dick
seizing the boat knife he critically reached within through and then without the rays of steel dragged in the line beyond passed it inboard to the bowsman and then twice sundering the rope near the chocks dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea and was all fast again,melville-moby_dick
as before the attentive ship having descried the whole fight again came bearing down to the rescue and dropping a boat picked up the floating mariners tubs oars and whatever else could be caught at and safely landed them on her decks,melville-moby_dick
aye aye starbuck tis sweet to lean sometimes be the leaner who he will and would old ahab had leaned oftener than he has,melville-moby_dick
nor white whale nor man nor fiend can so much as graze old ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being,melville-moby_dick
down the rest of the spare boats and rig them mr starbuck away and muster the boat s crews,melville-moby_dick
that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate,melville-moby_dick
surely i have not seen him yet,melville-moby_dick
the parsee,melville-moby_dick
my line,melville-moby_dick
this hand did dart it tis in the fish aloft there,melville-moby_dick
great god,melville-moby_dick
oh oh impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more,melville-moby_dick
twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled,melville-moby_dick
ye see an old man cut down to the stump leaning on a shivered lance propped up on a lonely foot,melville-moby_dick
then laugh aloud and cry encore,melville-moby_dick
as fearless fire cried stubb,melville-moby_dick
how valiantly i seek to drive out of others hearts what s clinched so fast in mine the parsee the parsee gone gone,melville-moby_dick
meantime of the broken keel of ahab s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg while still as on the night before slouched ahab stood fixed within his scuttle his hid heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial sat due eastward for the earliest sun,melville-moby_dick
cried ahab but the whale was not yet in sight,melville-moby_dick
here s food for thought had ahab time to think but ahab never thinks he only feels feels feels that s tingling enough for mortal man,melville-moby_dick
and still this hair is growing now this moment growing and heat must breed it but no it s like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere between the earthy clefts of greenland ice or in vesuvius lava,melville-moby_dick
i d crawl somewhere to a cave and slink there,melville-moby_dick
ha,melville-moby_dick
and yet i say again and swear it now that there s something all glorious and gracious in the wind,melville-moby_dick
aloft there,melville-moby_dick
the doubloon goes a begging,melville-moby_dick
aye he s chasing me now not i him that s bad i might have known it too,melville-moby_dick
about,melville-moby_dick
god keep us but already my bones feel damp within me and from the inside wet my flesh,melville-moby_dick
aye aye sir and straightway starbuck did ahab s bidding and once more ahab swung on high,melville-moby_dick
on deck there brace sharper up crowd her into the wind s eye,melville-moby_dick
but let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea there s time for that,melville-moby_dick
they must lead somewhere to something else than common land more palmy than the palms,melville-moby_dick
aye tiny mosses in these warped cracks,melville-moby_dick
by heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way,melville-moby_dick
will i have eyes at the bottom of the sea supposing i descend those endless stairs,melville-moby_dick
he gave the word and still gazing round him was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck,melville-moby_dick
aye sir thou wilt have it so,melville-moby_dick
their hands met their eyes fastened starbuck s tears the glue,melville-moby_dick
in an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern,melville-moby_dick
yet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship when numbers of sharks seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars every time they dipped in the water and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites,melville-moby_dick
oh,melville-moby_dick
thou fadest in pale glories behind me boy,melville-moby_dick
stir thyself starbuck stave it off move move,melville-moby_dick
he pecks he tears the vane pointing to the red flag flying at the main truck ha,melville-moby_dick
to their uttermost heads drive them in,melville-moby_dick
a low rumbling sound was heard a subterraneous hum and then all held their breaths as bedraggled with trailing ropes and harpoons and lances a vast form shot lengthwise but obliquely from the sea,melville-moby_dick
the wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted together as head on he came churning his tail among the boats and once more flailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates boats and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows but leaving ahab s almost without a scar,melville-moby_dick
drawing in a long lean breath aye parsee,melville-moby_dick
those boats are useless now repair them if ye can in time and return to me if not ahab is enough to die down men,melville-moby_dick
he seemed swimming with his utmost velocity and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea,melville-moby_dick
it is thou thou that madly seekest him,melville-moby_dick
as he saw all this as he heard the hammers in the broken boats far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart,melville-moby_dick
heed them not,melville-moby_dick
they will last long enough,melville-moby_dick
let me pass and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat,melville-moby_dick
but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug it snapped in the empty air,melville-moby_dick
hearing the tremendous rush of the sea crashing boat the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay but in that evolution catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions bethinking it it may be a larger and nobler foe of a sudden he bore down upon its advancing prow smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam,melville-moby_dick
the whale,melville-moby_dick
slope downwards to thy depths o sea that ere it be for ever too late ahab may slide this last last time upon his mark,melville-moby_dick
but as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledge hammering seas the before whale smitten bow ends of two planks burst through and in an instant almost the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves its half wading splashing crew trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water,melville-moby_dick
let not starbuck die if die he must in a woman s fainting fit,melville-moby_dick
oh ahab ahab lo thy work,melville-moby_dick
he turns to meet us,melville-moby_dick
who ever helped stubb or kept stubb awake but stubb s own unwinking eye,melville-moby_dick
for all that i would yet ring glasses with ye would ye but hand the cup,melville-moby_dick
for me off shoes and jacket to it let stubb die in his drawers,melville-moby_dick
cherries,melville-moby_dick
some fell flat upon their faces,melville-moby_dick
cried ahab from the boat its wood could only be american,melville-moby_dick
oh,melville-moby_dick
oh now i feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief,melville-moby_dick
and since neither can be mine let me then tow to pieces while still chasing thee though tied to thee thou damned whale,melville-moby_dick
for an instant the tranced boat s crew stood still then turned,melville-moby_dick
but as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the indian at the mainmast leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible together with long streaming yards of the flag which calmly undulated with ironical coincidings over the destroying billows they almost touched at that instant a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar,melville-moby_dick
the drama s done,melville-moby_dick
round and round then and ever contracting towards the button like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle like another ixion i did revolve,melville-moby_dick
it was the devious cruising rachel that in her retracing search after her missing children only found another orphan,melville-moby_dick
say first for heaven hides nothing from thy view nor the deep tract of hell say first what cause moved our grand parents in that happy state favoured of heaven so highly to fall off from their creator and transgress his will for one restraint lords of the world besides,milton-paradise
but his doom reserved him to more wrath for now the thought both of lost happiness and lasting pain torments him round he throws his baleful eyes that witnessed huge affliction and dismay mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate,milton-paradise
there the companions of his fall o erwhelmed with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire he soon discerns and weltering by his side one next himself in power and next in crime long after known in palestine and named beelzebub,milton-paradise
all is not lost the unconquerable will and study of revenge immortal hate and courage never to submit or yield and what is else not to be overcome,milton-paradise
what can it the avail though yet we feel strength undiminished or eternal being to undergo eternal punishment,milton-paradise
let us not slip th occasion whether scorn or satiate fury yield it from our foe,milton-paradise
so stretched out huge in length the arch fiend lay chained on the burning lake nor ever thence had risen or heaved his head but that the will and high permission of all ruling heaven left him at large to his own dark designs that with reiterated crimes he might heap on himself damnation while he sought evil to others and enraged might see how all his malice served but to bring forth infinite goodness grace and mercy shewn on man by him seduced but on himself treble confusion wrath and vengeance poured,milton-paradise
is this the region this the soil the clime said then the lost archangel this the seat that we must change for heaven this mournful gloom for that celestial light,milton-paradise
and thou profoundest hell receive thy new possessor one who brings a mind not to be changed by place or time,milton-paradise
so satan spake and him beelzebub thus answered leader of those armies bright which but th omnipotent none could have foiled,milton-paradise
nathless he so endured till on the beach of that inflamed sea he stood and called his legions angel forms who lay entranced thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks in vallombrosa where th etrurian shades high over arched embower or scattered sedge afloat when with fierce winds orion armed hath vexed the red sea coast whose waves o erthrew busiris and his memphian chivalry while with perfidious hatred they pursued the sojourners of goshen who beheld from the safe shore their floating carcases and broken chariot wheels,milton-paradise
awake arise or be for ever fallen,milton-paradise
nor had they yet among the sons of eve got them new names till wandering o er the earth through god s high sufferance for the trial of man by falsities and lies the greatest part of mankind they corrupted to forsake god their creator and th invisible glory of him that made them to transform oft to the image of a brute adorned with gay religions full of pomp and gold and devils to adore for deities then were they known to men by various names and various idols through the heathen world,milton-paradise
nor content with such audacious neighbourhood the wisest heart of solomon he led by fraoud to build his temple right against the temple of god on that opprobrious hill and made his grove the pleasant valley of hinnom tophet thence and black gehenna called the type of hell,milton-paradise
for those the race of israel oft forsook their living strength and unfrequented left his righteous altar bowing lowly down to bestial gods for which their heads as low bowed down in battle sunk before the spear of despicable foes,milton-paradise
he also against the house of god was bold a leper once he lost and gained a king ahaz his sottish conqueror whom he drew god s altar to disparage and displace for one of syrian mode whereon to burn his odious offerings and adore the gods whom he had vanquished,milton-paradise
in courts and palaces he also reigns and in luxurious cities where the noise of riot ascends above their loftiest towers and injury and outrage and when night darkens the streets then wander forth the sons of belial flown with insolence and wine,milton-paradise
but he his wonted pride soon recollecting with high words that bore semblance of worth not substance gently raised their fainting courage and dispelled their fears,milton-paradise
thus they breathing united force with fixed thought moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed their painful steps o er the burnt soil,milton-paradise
he above the rest in shape and gesture proudly eminent stood like a tower,milton-paradise
thrice he assayed and thrice in spite of scorn tears such as angels weep burst forth at last words interwove with sighs found out their way o myriads of immortal spirits,milton-paradise
but he who reigns monarch in heaven till then as one secure sat on his throne upheld by old repute consent or custom and his regal state put forth at full but still his strength concealed which tempted our attempt and wrought our fall,milton-paradise
peace is despaired for who can think submission,milton-paradise
thither winged with speed a numerous brigade hastened as when bands of pioneers with spade and pickaxe armed forerun the royal camp to trench a field or cast a rampart,milton-paradise
and here let those who boast in mortal things and wondering tell of babel and the works of memphian kings learn how their greatest monuments of fame and strength and art are easily outdone by spirits reprobate and in an hour what in an age they with incessant toil and hands innumerable scarce perform,milton-paradise
th ascending pile stood fixed her stately height and straight the doors opening their brazen folds discover wide within her ample spaces o er the smooth and level pavement from the arched roof pendent by subtle magic many a row of starry lamps and blazing cressets fed with naptha and asphaltus yielded light as from a sky,milton-paradise
meanwhile the winged heralds by command of sovereign power with awful ceremony and trumpet s sound throughout the host proclaim a solemn council forthwith to be held at pandemonium the high capital of satan and his peers,milton-paradise
they but now who seemed in bigness to surpass earth s giant sons now less than smallest dwarfs in narrow room throng numberless like that pygmean race beyond the indian mount or faery elves whose midnight revels by a forest side or fountain some belated peasant sees or dreams he sees while overhead the moon sits arbitress and nearer to the earth wheels her pale course they on their mirth and dance intent with jocund music charm his ear at once with joy and fear his heart rebounds,milton-paradise
high on a throne of royal state which far outshone the wealth or ormus and of ind or where the gorgeous east with richest hand showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold satan exalted sat by merit raised to that bad eminence and from despair thus high uplifted beyond hope aspires beyond thus high insatiate to pursue vain war with heaven and by success untaught his proud imaginations thus displayed powers and dominions deities of heaven for since no deep within her gulf can hold immortal vigour though oppressed and fallen i give not heaven for lost from this descent celestial virtues rising will appear more glorious and more dread than from no fall and trust themselves to fear no second fate me though just right and the fixed laws of heaven did first create your leader next free choice with what besides in council or in fight hath been achieved of merit yet this loss thus far at least recovered hath much more established in a safe unenvied throne yielded with full consent,milton-paradise
he ceased and next him moloch sceptred king stood up the strongest and the fiercest spirit that fought in heaven now fiercer by despair,milton-paradise
let us rather choose armed with hell flames and fury all at once o er heaven s high towers to force resistless way turning our tortures into horrid arms against the torturer when to meet the noise of his almighty engine he shall hear infernal thunder and for lightning see black fire and horror shot with equal rage among his angels and his throne itself mixed with tartarean sulphur and strange fire his own invented torments,milton-paradise
should we again provoke our stronger some worse way his wrath may find to our destruction if there be in hell fear to be worse destroyed,milton-paradise
what doubt we to incense his utmost ire,milton-paradise
but all was false and hollow though his tongue dropped manna and could make the worse appear the better reason to perplex and dash maturest counsels for his thoughts were low to vice industrious but to nobler deeds timorous and slothful,milton-paradise
thus repulsed our final hope is flat despair we must exasperate th almighty victor to spend all his rage and that must end us that must be our cure to be no more,milton-paradise
will he so wise let loose at once his ire belike through impotence or unaware to give his enemies their wish and end them in his anger whom his anger saves to punish endless,milton-paradise
this hell then seemed a refuge from those wounds,milton-paradise
this would be worse,milton-paradise
to suffer as to do our strength is equal nor the law unjust that so ordains,milton-paradise
thus belial with words clothed in reason s garb counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth not peace and after him thus mammon spake either to disenthrone the king of heaven we war if war be best or to regain our own right lost,milton-paradise
how wearisome eternity so spent in worship paid to whom we hate,milton-paradise
mustering their rage and heaven resembles hell,milton-paradise
ye have what i advise,milton-paradise
sage he stood with atlantean shoulders fit to bear the weight of mightiest monarchies his look drew audience and attention still as night or summer s noontide air while thus he spake thrones and imperial powers offspring of heaven ethereal virtues,milton-paradise
what sit we then projecting peace and war,milton-paradise
there is a place if ancient and prophetic fame in heaven err not another world the happy seat of some new race called man about this time to be created like to us though less in power and excellence but favoured more of him who rules above so was his will pronounced among the gods and by an oath that shook heaven s whole circumference confirmed,milton-paradise
thus beelzebub pleaded his devilish counsel first devised by satan and in part proposed for whence but from the author of all ill could spring so deep a malice to confound the race of mankind in one root and earth with hell to mingle and involve done all to spite the great creator,milton-paradise
who shall tempt with wandering feet the dark unbottomed infinite abyss and through the palpable obscure find out his uncouth way or spread his airy flight upborne with indefatigable wings over the vast abrupt ere he arrive the happy isle,milton-paradise
none among the choice and prime of those heaven warring champions could be found so hardy as to proffer or accept alone the dreadful voyage till at last satan whom now transcendent glory raised above his fellows with monarchal pride conscious of highest worth unmoved thus spake o progeny of heaven,milton-paradise
these passed if any pass the void profound of unessential night receives him next wide gaping and with utter loss of being threatens him plunged in that abortive gulf,milton-paradise
this enterprise none shall partake with me,milton-paradise
nor failed they to express how much they praised that for the general safety he despised his own for neither do the spirits damned lose all their virtue lest bad men should boast their specious deeds on earth which glory excites or close ambition varnished o er with zeal,milton-paradise
then of their session ended they bid cry with trumpet s regal sound the great result toward the four winds four speedy cherubim put to their mouths the sounding alchemy by herald s voice explained the hollow abyss heard far adn wide and all the host of hell with deafening shout returned them loud acclaim,milton-paradise
their song was partial but the harmony what could it less when spirits immortal sing,milton-paradise
far off from these a slow and silent stream lethe the river of oblivion rolls her watery labyrinth whereof who drinks forthwith his former state and being forgets forgets both joy and grief pleasure and pain,milton-paradise
through many a dark and dreary vale they passed and many a region dolorous o er many a frozen many a fiery alp rocks caves lakes fens bogs dens and shades of death a universe of death which god by curse created evil for evil only good where all life dies death lives and nature breeds perverse all monstrous all prodigious things obominable inutterable and worse than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived gorgons and hydras and chimeras dire,milton-paradise
the one seemed woman to the waist and fair but ended foul in many a scaly fold voluminous and vast a serpent armed with mortal sting,milton-paradise
th undaunted fiend what this might be admired admired not feared god and his son except created thing naught valued he nor shunned and with disdainful look thus first began whence and what art thou execrable shape that dar st though grim and terrible advance thy miscreated front athwart my way to yonder gates,milton-paradise
and reckon st thou thyself with spirits of heaven hell doomed and breath st defiance here and scorn where i reign king and to enrage thee more thy king and lord,milton-paradise
so frowned the mighty combatants that hell grew darker at their frown so matched they stood for never but once more was wither like to meet so great a foe,milton-paradise
for him who sits above and laughs the while at thee ordained his drudge to execute whate er his wrath which he calls justice bids his wrath which one day will destroy ye both,milton-paradise
meanwhile war arose and fields were fought in heaven wherein remained for what could else,milton-paradise
i fled and cried out death,milton-paradise
she finished and the subtle fiend his lore soon learned now milder and thus answered smooth dear daughter since thou claim st me for thy sire and my fair son here show st me the dear pledge of dalliance had with thee in heaven and joys then sweet now sad to mention through dire change befallen us unforeseen unthought of know i come no enemy but to set free from out this dark and dismal house of pain both him and thee and all the heavenly host of spirits that in our just pretences armed fell with us from on high,milton-paradise
no less rejoiced his mother bad and thus bespake her sire the key of this infernal pit by due and by command of heaven s all powerful king i keep by him forbidden to unlock these adamantine gates against all force death ready stands to interpose his dart fearless to be o ermatched by living might,milton-paradise
thus saying from her side the fatal key sad instrument of all our woe she took and towards the gate rolling her bestial train forthwith the huge portcullis high up drew which but herself not all the stygian powers could once have moved then in the key hole turns th intricate wards and every bolt and bar of massy iron or solid rock with ease unfastens,milton-paradise
to whom these most adhere he rules a moment chaos umpire sits and by decision more embroils the fray by which he reigns next him high arbiter chance governs all,milton-paradise
that fury stayed quenched in a boggy syrtis neither sea nor good dry land nigh foundered on he fares treading the crude consistence half on foot half flying behoves him now both oar and sail,milton-paradise
t whom satan turning boldly thus ye powers and spirtis of this nethermost abyss chaos and ancient night i come no spy with purpose to explore or to disturb the secrets of your realm but by constraint wandering this darksome desert as my way lies through your spacious empire up to light alone and without guide half lost i seek what readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds confine with heaven or if some other place from your dominion won th ethereal king possesses lately thither to arrive i travel this profound,milton-paradise
i upon my frontiers here keep residence if all i can will serve that little which is left so to defend encroached on still through our intestine broils weakening the sceptre of old night first hell your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath now lately heaven and earth another world hung o er my realm linked in a golden chain to that side heaven from whence your legions fell,milton-paradise
sin and death amain following his track such was the will of heaven paved after him a broad and beaten way over the dark abyss whose boiling gulf tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length from hell continued reaching th utmost orb of this frail world by which the spirits perverse with easy intercourse pass to and fro to tempt or punish mortals except whom god and good angels guard by special grace,milton-paradise
hail holy light offspring of heaven firstborn or of the eternal coeternal beam may i express thee unblam d,milton-paradise
yet not the more cease i to wander where the muses haunt clear spring or shady grove or sunny hill smit with the love of sacred song but chief thee sion and the flowery brooks beneath that wash thy hallow d feet and warbling flow nightly i visit nor sometimes forget so were i equall d with them in renown thy sovran command that man should find grace blind thamyris and blind maeonides and tiresias and phineus prophets old then feed on thoughts that voluntary move harmonious numbers as the wakeful bird sings darkling and in shadiest covert hid tunes her nocturnal note,milton-paradise
only begotten son seest thou what rage transports our adversary,milton-paradise
such i created all the ethereal powers and spirits both them who stood and them who fail d freely they stood who stood and fell who fell,milton-paradise
so without least impulse or shadow of fate or aught by me immutably foreseen they trespass authors to themselves in all both what they judge and what they choose for so i form d them free and free they must remain till they enthrall themselves i else must change their nature and revoke the high decree unchangeable eternal which ordain d their freedom they themselves ordain d their fall,milton-paradise
for should man finally be lost should man thy creature late so lov d thy youngest son fall circumvented thus by fraud though join d with his own folly,milton-paradise
so should thy goodness and thy greatness both be question d and blasphem d without defence,milton-paradise
to prayer repentance and obedience due though but endeavour d with sincere intent mine ear shall not be slow mine eye not shut,milton-paradise
which of you will be mortal to redeem man s mortal crime and just the unjust to save,milton-paradise
happy for man so coming he her aid can never seek once dead in sins and lost atonement for himself or offering meet indebted and undone hath none to bring behold me then me for him life for life i offer on me let thine anger fall account me man i for his sake will leave thy bosom and this glory next to thee freely put off and for him lastly die well pleased on me let death wreak all his rage,milton-paradise
his words here ended but his meek aspect silent yet spake and breathed immortal love to mortal men above which only shone filial obedience as a sacrifice glad to be offered he attends the will of his great father,milton-paradise
as in him perish all men so in thee as from a second root shall be restored as many as are restored without thee none,milton-paradise
because thou hast though throned in highest bliss equal to god and equally enjoying god like fruition quitted all to save a world from utter loss and hast been found by merit more than birthright son of god found worthiest to be so by being good far more than great or high because in thee love hath abounded more than glory abounds therefore thy humiliation shall exalt with thee thy manhood also to this throne here shalt thou sit incarnate here shalt reign both god and man son both of god and man anointed universal king all power i give thee reign for ever and assume thy merits under thee as head supreme thrones princedoms powers dominions i reduce all knees to thee shall bow of them that bide in heaven or earth or under earth in hell,milton-paradise
but all ye gods adore him who to compass all this dies adore the son and honour him as me,milton-paradise
he heaven of heavens and all the powers therein by thee created and by thee threw down the aspiring dominations thou that day thy father s dreadful thunder didst not spare nor stop thy flaming chariot wheels that shook heaven s everlasting frame while o er the necks thou drovest of warring angels disarrayed,milton-paradise
thus they in heaven above the starry sphere their happy hours in joy and hymning spent,milton-paradise
all this dark globe the fiend found as he passed and long he wandered till at last a gleam of dawning light turned thither ward in haste his travelled steps far distant he descries ascending by degrees magnificent up to the wall of heaven a structure high at top whereof but far more rich appeared the work as of a kingly palace gate with frontispiece of diamond and gold embellished thick with sparkling orient gems the portal shone inimitable on earth by model or by shading pencil drawn,milton-paradise
as when a scout through dark,milton-paradise
the place he found beyond expression bright compared with aught on earth metal or stone not all parts like but all alike informed with radiant light as glowing iron with fire if metal part seemed gold part silver clear if stone carbuncle most or chrysolite ruby or topaz to the twelve that shone in aaron s breast plate and a stone besides imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen that stone or like to that which here below philosophers in vain so long have sought in vain though by their powerful art they bind volatile hermes and call up unbound in various shapes old proteus from the sea drained through a limbeck to his native form,milton-paradise
he drew not nigh unheard the angel bright ere he drew nigh his radiant visage turned admonished by his ear and straight was known the arch angel uriel one of the seven who in god s presence nearest to his throne stand ready at command and are his eyes that run through all the heavens or down to the earth bear his swift errands over moist and dry o er sea and land him satan thus accosts,milton-paradise
i saw when at his word the formless mass this world s material mould came to a heap confusion heard his voice and wild uproar stood ruled stood vast infinitude confined till at his second bidding darkness fled light shone and order from disorder sprung swift to their several quarters hasted then the cumbrous elements earth flood air fire and this ethereal quintessence of heaven flew upward spirited with various forms that rolled orbicular and turned to stars numberless as thou seest and how they move each had his place appointed each his course the rest in circuit walls this universe,milton-paradise
book iv,milton-paradise
to tell thee how i hate thy beams that bring to my remembrance from what state i fell how glorious once above thy sphere till pride and worse ambition threw me down warring in heaven against heaven s matchless king ah wherefore,milton-paradise
hadst thou the same free will and power to stand,milton-paradise
which way shall i fly infinite wrath and infinite despair,milton-paradise
they little know how dearly i abide that boast so vain under what torments inwardly i groan while they adore me on the throne of hell,milton-paradise
this knows my punisher therefore as far from granting he as i from begging peace all hope excluded thus behold in stead mankind created and for him this world,milton-paradise
whereof he soon aware each perturbation smoothed with outward calm artificer of fraud and was the first that practised falsehood under saintly show deep malice to conceal couched with revenge yet not enough had practised to deceive uriel once warned whose eye pursued him down the way he went and on the assyrian mount saw him disfigured more than could befall spirit of happy sort his gestures fierce he marked and mad demeanour then alone as he supposed all unobserved unseen,milton-paradise
as when to them who fail beyond the cape of hope and now are past mozambick off at sea north east winds blow sabean odours from the spicy shore of araby the blest with such delay well pleased they slack their course and many a league cheered with the grateful smell old ocean smiles so entertained those odorous sweets the fiend who came their bane though with them better pleased than asmodeus with the fishy fume that drove him though enamoured from the spouse of tobit s son and with a vengeance sent from media post to egypt there fast bound,milton-paradise
so little knows any but god alone to value right the good before him but perverts best things to worst abuse or to their meanest use,milton-paradise
so passed they naked on nor shunned the sight of god or angel for they thought no ill so hand in hand they passed the loveliest pair that ever since in love s embraces met adam the goodliest man of men since born his sons the fairest of her daughters eve,milton-paradise
into our room of bliss thus high advanced creatures of other mould earth born perhaps not spirits yet to heavenly spirits bright little inferiour whom my thoughts pursue with wonder and could love so lively shines in them divine resemblance and such grace the hand that formed them on their shape hath poured,milton-paradise
then from his lofty stand on that high tree down he alights among the sportful herd of those four footed kinds himself now one now other as their shape served best his end nearer to view his prey and unespied to mark what of their state he more might learn by word or action marked,milton-paradise
o thou for whom and from whom i was formed flesh of thy flesh and without whom am to no end my guide and head,milton-paradise
as i bent down to look just opposite a shape within the watery gleam appeared bending to look on me i started back it started back but pleased i soon returned pleased it returned as soon with answering looks of sympathy and love there i had fixed mine eyes till now and pined with vain desire had not a voice thus warned me what thou seest what there thou seest fair creature is thyself with thee it came and goes but follow me and i will bring thee where no shadow stays thy coming and thy soft embraces he whose image thou art him thou shalt enjoy inseparably thine to him shalt bear multitudes like thyself and thence be called mother of human race,milton-paradise
sight hateful sight tormenting,milton-paradise
can it be death,milton-paradise
live while ye may yet happy pair enjoy till i return short pleasures for long woes are to succeed,milton-paradise
this day at highth of noon came to my sphere a spirit zealous as he seemed to know more of the almighty s works and chiefly man god s latest image i described his way bent all on speed and marked his aery gait but in the mount that lies from eden north where he first lighted soon discerned his looks alien from heaven with passions foul obscured mine eye pursued him still but under shade lost sight of him one of the banished crew i fear hath ventured from the deep to raise new troubles him thy care must be to find,milton-paradise
now came still evening on and twilight gray had in her sober livery all things clad silence accompanied for beast and bird they to their grassy couch these to their nests were slunk all but the wakeful nightingale she all night long her amorous descant sung silence was pleased now glowed the firmament with living sapphires hesperus that led the starry host rode brightest till the moon rising in clouded majesty at length apparent queen unveiled her peerless light and o er the dark her silver mantle threw,milton-paradise
with thee conversing i forget all time all seasons and their change all please alike,milton-paradise
daughter of god and man accomplished eve these have their course to finish round the earth by morrow evening and from land to land in order though to nations yet unborn ministring light prepared they set and rise lest total darkness should by night regain her old possession and extinguish life in nature and all things which these soft fires not only enlighten but with kindly heat of various influence foment and warm temper or nourish or in part shed down their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow on earth made hereby apter to receive perfection from the sun s more potent ray,milton-paradise
here in close recess with flowers garlands and sweet smelling herbs espoused eve decked first her nuptial bed and heavenly quires the hymenaean sung what day the genial angel to our sire brought her in naked beauty more adorned more lovely than pandora whom the gods endowed with all their gifts and o,milton-paradise

these lulled by nightingales embracing slept and on their naked limbs the flowery roof showered roses which the morn repaired,milton-paradise
from these two strong and subtle spirits he called that near him stood and gave them thus in charge,milton-paradise
him thus intent ithuriel with his spear touched lightly for no falshood can endure touch of celestial temper but returns of force to its own likeness up he starts discovered and surprised,milton-paradise
know ye not then said satan filled with scorn know ye not me,milton-paradise
so spake the cherub and his grave rebuke severe in youthful beauty added grace invincible abashed the devil stood and felt how awful goodness is and saw virtue in her shape how lovely saw and pined his loss but chiefly to find here observed his lustre visibly impaired yet seemed undaunted,milton-paradise
to whom their chief gabriel from the front thus called aloud,milton-paradise
why hast thou satan broke the bounds prescribed to thy transgressions and disturbed the charge of others who approve not to transgress by thy example but have power and right to question thy bold entrance on this place employed it seems to violate sleep and those whose dwelling god hath planted here in bliss,milton-paradise
who would not finding way break loose from hell though thither doomed,milton-paradise
the warlike angel moved disdainfully half smiling thus replied,milton-paradise
wherefore with thee came not all hell broke loose,milton-paradise
to which the fiend thus answered frowning stern,milton-paradise
o name o sacred name of faithfulness profaned,milton-paradise
and thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem patron of liberty who more than thou once fawned and cringed and servily adored heaven s awful monarch,milton-paradise
then when i am thy captive talk of chains proud limitary cherub,milton-paradise
since thine no more than heaven permits nor mine though doubled now to trample thee as mire for proof look up and read thy lot in yon celestial sign where thou art weighed and shown how light how weak if thou resist,milton-paradise
awake the morning shines and the fresh field calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring our tender plants how blows the citron grove what drops the myrrh and what the balmy reed how nature paints her colours how the bee sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet,milton-paradise
in whose sight all things joy with ravishment attracted by thy beauty still to gaze,milton-paradise
this said he paused not but with venturous arm he plucked he tasted me damp horrour chilled at such bold words vouched with a deed so bold but he thus overjoyed o fruit divine sweet of thyself but much more sweet thus cropt forbidden here it seems as only fit for gods yet able to make gods of men and why not gods of men since good the more communicated more abundant grows the author not impaired but honoured more,milton-paradise
thus eve her night related and thus adam answered sad,milton-paradise
some such resemblances methinks i find of our last evening s talk in this thy dream but with addition strange yet be not sad,milton-paradise
but first from under shady arborous roof soon as they forth were come to open sight of day spring and the sun who scarce up risen with wheels yet hovering o er the ocean brim shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray discovering in wide landskip all the east of paradise and eden s happy plains lowly they bowed adoring and began their orisons each morning duly paid in various style for neither various style nor holy rapture wanted they to praise their maker in fit strains pronounced or sung unmeditated such prompt eloquence flowed from their lips in prose or numerous verse more tuneable than needed lute or harp to add more sweetness and they thus began,milton-paradise
fairest of stars last in the train of night if better thou belong not to the dawn sure pledge of day that crownest the smiling morn with thy bright circlet praise him in thy sphere while day arises that sweet hour of prime,milton-paradise
his praise ye winds that from four quarters blow breathe soft or loud and wave your tops ye pines with every plant in sign of worship wave,milton-paradise
so prayed they innocent and to their thoughts firm peace recovered soon and wonted calm,milton-paradise
no for that shall be withstood but by deceit and lies this let him know lest wilfully transgressing he pretend surprisal unadmonished unforewarned,milton-paradise
at once on the eastern cliff of paradise he lights and to his proper shape returns a seraph winged six wings he wore to shade his lineaments divine the pair that clad each shoulder broad came mantling o er his breast with regal ornament the middle pair girt like a starry zone his waist and round skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold and colours dipt in heaven the third his feet shadowed from either heel with feathered mail sky tinctured grain,milton-paradise
haste hither eve and worth thy sight behold eastward among those trees what glorious shape comes this way moving seems another morn risen on mid noon some great behest from heaven to us perhaps he brings and will vouchsafe this day to be our guest,milton-paradise
so saying with dispatchful looks in haste she turns on hospitable thoughts intent what choice to choose for delicacy best what order so contrived as not to mix tastes not well joined inelegant but bring taste after taste upheld with kindliest change bestirs her then and from each tender stalk whatever earth all bearing mother yields in india east or west or middle shore in pontus or the punick coast or where alcinous reigned fruit of all kinds in coat rough or smooth rind or bearded husk or shell she gathers tribute large and on the board heaps with unsparing hand for drink the grape she crushes inoffensive must and meaths from many a berry and from sweet kernels pressed she tempers dulcet creams nor these to hold wants her fit vessels pure then strows the ground with rose and odours from the shrub unfumed,milton-paradise
adam i therefore came nor art thou such created or such place hast here to dwell as may not oft invite though spirits of heaven to visit thee lead on then where thy bower o ershades for these mid hours till evening rise i have at will,milton-paradise
heavenly stranger please to taste these bounties which our nourisher from whom all perfect good unmeasured out descends to us for food and for delight hath caused the earth to yield unsavoury food perhaps to spiritual natures only this i know that one celestial father gives to all,milton-paradise
the sun that light imparts to all receives from all his alimental recompence in humid exhalations and at even sups with the ocean,milton-paradise
thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed not burdened nature sudden mind arose in adam not to let the occasion pass given him by this great conference to know of things above his world and of their being who dwell in heaven whose excellence he saw transcend his own so far whose radiant forms divine effulgence whose high power so far exceeded human and his wary speech thus to the empyreal minister he framed,milton-paradise
time may come when men with angels may participate and find no inconvenient diet nor too light fare and from these corporal nutriments perhaps your bodies may at last turn all to spirit improved by tract of time and winged ascend ethereal as we or may at choice here or in heavenly paradises dwell if ye be found obedient and retain unalterably firm his love entire whose progeny you are,milton-paradise
can we want obedience then to him or possibly his love desert who formed us from the dust and placed us here full to the utmost measure of what bliss human desires can seek or apprehend,milton-paradise
god made thee perfect not immutable and good he made thee but to persevere he left it in thy power ordained thy will by nature free not over ruled by fate inextricable or strict necessity our voluntary service he requires not our necessitated such with him finds no acceptance nor can find for how can hearts not free be tried whether they serve willing or no who will but what they must by destiny and can no other choose,milton-paradise
high matter thou enjoinest me o prime of men sad task and hard for how shall i relate to human sense the invisible exploits of warring spirits,milton-paradise
thus when in orbs of circuit inexpressible they stood orb within orb the father infinite by whom in bliss imbosomed sat the son amidst as from a flaming mount whose top brightness had made invisible thus spake,milton-paradise
evening now approached for we have also our evening and our morn we ours for change delectable not need forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn desirous all in circles as they stood tables are set and on a sudden piled with angels food and rubied nectar flows in pearl in diamond and massy gold fruit of delicious vines the growth of heaven,milton-paradise
what sleep can close thy eye lids,milton-paradise
so spake the false arch angel and infused bad influence into the unwary breast of his associate he together calls or several one by one the regent powers under him regent tells as he was taught that the most high commanding now ere night now ere dim night had disincumbered heaven the great hierarchal standard was to move tells the suggested cause and casts between ambiguous words and jealousies to sound or taint integrity but all obeyed the wonted signal and superiour voice of their great potentate for great indeed his name and high was his degree in heaven his countenance as the morning star that guides the starry flock allured them and with lies drew after him the third part of heaven s host,milton-paradise
mighty father thou thy foes justly hast in derision and secure laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain matter to me of glory whom their hate illustrates when they see all regal power given me to quell their pride and in event know whether i be dextrous to subdue thy rebels or be found the worst in heaven,milton-paradise
but double how endured to one and to his image now proclaimed,milton-paradise
or can introduce law and edict on us who without law err not,milton-paradise
canst thou with impious obloquy condemn the just decree of god pronounced and sworn that to his only son by right endued with regal scepter every soul in heaven shall bend the knee and in that honour due confess him rightful king,milton-paradise
but to grant it thee unjust that equal over equals monarch reign thyself though great and glorious dost thou count or all angelick nature joined in one equal to him begotten son,milton-paradise
and the work of secondary hands by task transferred from father to his son,milton-paradise
our puissance is our own our own right hand shall teach us highest deeds by proof to try who is our equal then thou shalt behold whether by supplication we intend address and to begirt the almighty throne beseeching or besieging,milton-paradise
well thou didst advise yet not for thy advice or threats i fly these wicked tents devoted lest the wrath impendent raging into sudden flame distinguish not for soon expect to feel his thunder on thy head devouring fire,milton-paradise
all night the dreadless angel unpursued through heaven s wide champain held his way till morn waked by the circling hours with rosy hand unbarred the gates of light,milton-paradise
go michael of celestial armies prince and thou in military prowess next gabriel lead forth to battle these my sons invincible lead forth my armed saints by thousands and by millions ranged for fight equal in number to that godless crew rebellious them with fire and hostile arms fearless assault and to the brow of heaven pursuing drive them out from god and bliss into their place of punishment the gulf of tartarus which ready opens wide his fiery chaos to receive their fall,milton-paradise
that such resemblance of the highest should yet remain where faith and realty remain not wherefore should not strength and might there fail where virtue fails or weakest prove where boldest though to fight unconquerable,milton-paradise
whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance thus answered,milton-paradise
to whom in brief thus abdiel stern replied,milton-paradise
so saying a noble stroke he lifted high which hung not but so swift with tempest fell on the proud crest of satan that no sight nor motion of swift thought less could his shield such ruin intercept ten paces huge he back recoiled the tenth on bended knee his massy spear upstaid as if on earth winds under ground or waters forcing way sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat half sunk with all his pines,milton-paradise
what wonder,milton-paradise
how hast thou instilled thy malice into thousands once upright and faithful now proved false,milton-paradise
so spake the prince of angels to whom thus the adversary,milton-paradise
for likest gods they seemed stood they or moved in stature motion arms fit to decide the empire of great heaven,milton-paradise
mean while in other parts like deeds deserved memorial where the might of gabriel fought and with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array of moloch furious king who him defied and at his chariot wheels to drag him bound threatened nor from the holy one of heaven refrained his tongue blasphemous but anon down cloven to the waist with shattered arms and uncouth pain fled bellowing,milton-paradise
and now their mightiest quelled the battle swerved with many an inroad gored deformed rout entered and foul disorder all the ground with shivered armour strown and on a heap chariot and charioteer lay overturned and fiery foaming steeds what stood recoiled o er wearied through the faint satanick host defensive scarce or with pale fear surprised then first with fear surprised and sense of pain fled ignominious to such evil brought by sin of disobedience till that hour not liable to fear or flight or pain,milton-paradise
true is less firmly armed some disadvantage we endured and pain till now not known but known as soon contemned since now we find this our empyreal form incapable of mortal injury imperishable and though pierced with wound soon closing and by native vigour healed,milton-paradise
he who therefore can invent with what more forcible we may offend our yet unwounded enemies or arm ourselves with like defence to me deserves no less than for deliverance what we owe,milton-paradise
nor long shall be our labour yet ere dawn effect shall end our wish,milton-paradise
so all ere day spring under conscious night secret they finished and in order set with silent circumspection unespied,milton-paradise
at interview both stood a while but suddenly at head appeared satan and thus was heard commanding loud,milton-paradise
immediate in a flame but soon obscured with smoke all heaven appeared from those deep throated engines belched whose roar embowelled with outrageous noise the air and all her entrails tore disgorging foul their devilish glut chained thunderbolts and hail of iron globes which on the victor host levelled with such impetuous fury smote that whom they hit none on their feet might stand though standing else as rocks but down they fell by thousands angel on arch angel rolled the sooner for their arms unarmed they might have easily as spirits evaded swift by quick contraction or remove but now foul dissipation followed and forced rout nor served it to relax their serried files,milton-paradise
why come not on these victors proud ere while they fierce were coming and when we to entertain them fair with open front and breast what could we more,milton-paradise
so they among themselves in pleasant vein stood scoffing hightened in their thoughts beyond all doubt of victory eternal might to match with their inventions they presumed so easy and of his thunder made a scorn and all his host derided while they stood a while in trouble but they stood not long rage prompted them at length and found them arms against such hellish mischief fit to oppose,milton-paradise
effulgence of my glory son beloved son in whose face invisible is beheld visibly what by deity i am and in whose hand what by decree i do second omnipotence,milton-paradise
he said and on his son with rays direct shone full he all his father full expressed ineffably into his face received and thus the filial godhead answering spake,milton-paradise
forth rushed with whirlwind sound the chariot of paternal deity flashing thick flames wheel within wheel undrawn itself instinct with spirit but convoyed by four cherubick shapes four faces each had wonderous as with stars their bodies all and wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels of beryl and careering fires between over their heads a crystal firmament whereon a sapphire throne inlaid with pure amber and colours of the showery arch,milton-paradise
but to convince the proud what signs avail or wonders move the obdurate to relent,milton-paradise
at once the four spread out their starry wings with dreadful shade contiguous and the orbs of his fierce chariot rolled as with the sound of torrent floods or of a numerous host,milton-paradise
hell heard the unsufferable noise hell saw heaven ruining from heaven and would have fled affrighted but strict fate had cast too deep her dark foundations and too fast had bound,milton-paradise
but listen not to his temptations warn thy weaker let it profit thee to have heard by terrible example the reward of disobedience firm they might have stood yet fell remember and fear to transgress,milton-paradise
half yet remains unsung but narrower bound within the visible diurnal sphere standing on earth not rapt above the pole more safe i sing with mortal voice unchanged to hoarse or mute though fallen on evil days on evil days though fallen and evil tongues in darkness and with dangers compassed round and solitude yet not alone while thou visitest my slumbers nightly or when morn purples the east still govern thou my song urania and fit audience find though few,milton-paradise
whence adam soon repealed the doubts that in his heart arose and now led on yet sinless with desire to know what nearer might concern him how this world of heaven and earth conspicuous first began when and whereof created for what cause what within eden or without was done before his memory as one whose drouth yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest,milton-paradise
thus adam his illustrious guest besought and thus the godlike angel answered mild,milton-paradise
at least our envious foe hath failed who thought all like himself rebellious by whose aid this inaccessible high strength the seat of deity supreme us dispossessed he trusted to have seised and into fraud drew many whom their place knows here no more yet far the greater part have kept i see their station heaven yet populous retains number sufficient to possess her realms though wide and this high temple to frequent with ministeries due and solemn rites but lest his heart exalt him in the harm already done to have dispeopled heaven my damage fondly deemed i can repair that detriment if such it be to lose self lost and in a moment will create another world out of one man a race of men innumerable there to dwell not here till by degrees of merit raised they open to themselves at length the way up hither under long obedience tried and earth be changed to heaven and heaven to earth one kingdom joy and union without end,milton-paradise
immediate are the acts of god more swift than time or motion but to human ears cannot without process of speech be told so told as earthly notion can receive,milton-paradise
silence ye troubled waves and thou deep peace said then the omnifick word your discord end,milton-paradise
god saw the light was good and light from darkness by the hemisphere divided light the day and darkness night he named,milton-paradise
the dry land earth and the great receptacle of congregated waters he called seas and saw that it was good and said let the earth put forth the verdant grass herb yielding seed and fruit tree yielding fruit after her kind whose seed is in herself upon the earth,milton-paradise
hither as to their fountain other stars repairing in their golden urns draw light and hence the morning planet gilds her horns by tincture or reflection they augment their small peculiar though from human sight so far remote with diminution seen first in his east the glorious lamp was seen regent of day and all the horizon round invested with bright rays jocund to run his longitude through heaven s high road the gray dawn and the pleiades before him danced shedding sweet influence less bright the moon but opposite in levelled west was set his mirrour with full face borrowing her light from him for other light she needed none in that aspect and still that distance keeps till night then in the east her turn she shines revolved on heaven s great axle and her reign with thousand lesser lights dividual holds with thousand thousand stars that then appeared spangling the hemisphere then first adorned with their bright luminaries that set and rose glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day,milton-paradise
mean while the tepid caves and fens and shores their brood as numerous hatch from the egg that soon bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed their callow young but feathered soon and fledge they summed their pens and soaring the air sublime with clang despised the ground under a cloud in prospect there the eagle and the stork on cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build part loosely wing the region part more wise in common ranged in figure wedge their way intelligent of seasons and set forth their aery caravan high over seas flying and over lands with mutual wing easing their flight so steers the prudent crane her annual voyage borne on winds the air floats as they pass fanned with unnumbered plumes from branch to branch the smaller birds with song solaced the woods and spread their painted wings till even nor then the solemn nightingale ceased warbling but all night tun d her soft lays others on silver lakes and rivers bathed their downy breast the swan with arched neck between her white wings mantling proudly rows her state with oary feet yet oft they quit the dank and rising on stiff pennons tower the mid aereal sky others on ground walked firm the crested cock whose clarion sounds the silent hours and the other whose gay train adorns him coloured with the florid hue of rainbows and starry eyes,milton-paradise
at once came forth whatever creeps the ground insect or worm those waved their limber fans for wings and smallest lineaments exact in all the liveries decked of summer s pride with spots of gold and purple azure and green these as a line their long dimension drew streaking the ground with sinuous trace not all minims of nature some of serpent kind wonderous in length and corpulence involved their snaky folds and added wings,milton-paradise
this said he formed thee adam thee o man dust of the ground and in thy nostrils breathed the breath of life in his own image he created thee in the image of god express and thou becamest a living soul,milton-paradise
open ye everlasting gates,milton-paradise
creation and the six days acts they sung great are thy works jehovah,milton-paradise
easily the proud attempt of spirits apostate and their counsels vain thou hast repelled while impiously they thought thee to diminish and from thee withdraw the number of thy worshippers,milton-paradise
so sung they and the empyrean rung with halleluiahs thus was sabbath kept,milton-paradise
something yet of doubt remains which only thy solution can resolve,milton-paradise
when meet now such pairs in love and mutual honour joined,milton-paradise
and for the heaven s wide circuit let it speak the maker s high magnificence who built so spacious and his line stretched out so far that man may know he dwells not in his own an edifice too large for him to fill lodged in a small partition and the rest ordained for uses to his lord best known,milton-paradise
their wandering course now high now low then hid progressive retrograde or standing still in six thou seest and what if seventh to these the planet earth so stedfast though she seem insensibly three different motions move,milton-paradise
but whether thus these things or whether not but whether the sun predominant in heaven rise on the earth or earth rise on the sun he from the east his flaming road begin or she from west her silent course advance with inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps on her soft axle while she paces even and bears thee soft with the smooth hair along sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid leave them to god above him serve and fear,milton-paradise
but apt the mind or fancy is to rove unchecked and of her roving is no end till warned or by experience taught she learn that not to know at large of things remote from use obscure and subtle but to know that which before us lies in daily life is the prime wisdom what is more is fume or emptiness or fond impertinence and renders us in things that most concern unpractised unprepared and still to seek,milton-paradise
nor are thy lips ungraceful sire of men nor tongue ineloquent for god on thee abundantly his gifts hath also poured inward and outward both his image fair speaking or mute all comeliness and grace attends thee and each word each motion forms nor less think we in heaven of thee on earth than of our fellow servant and inquire gladly into the ways of god with man for god we see hath honoured thee and set on man his equal love say therefore on for i that day was absent as befel bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure far on excursion toward the gates of hell squared in full legion such command we had to see that none thence issued forth a spy or enemy while god was in his work lest he incensed at such eruption bold destruction with creation might have mixed,milton-paradise
so spake the godlike power and thus our sire,milton-paradise
thou sun said i fair light and thou enlightened earth so fresh and gay ye hills and dales ye rivers woods and plains and ye that live and move fair creatures tell tell if ye saw how i came thus how here not of myself by some great maker then in goodness and in power pre eminent tell me how may i know him how adore from whom i have that thus i move and live and feel that i am happier than i know while thus i called and strayed i knew not whither from where i first drew air and first beheld this happy light when answer none returned on a green shady bank profuse of flowers pensive i sat me down there gentle sleep first found me and with soft oppression seised my droused sense untroubled though i thought i then was passing to my former state insensible and forthwith to dissolve when suddenly stood at my head a dream whose inward apparition gently moved my fancy to believe i yet had being and lived one came methought of shape divine and said thy mansion wants thee adam rise first man of men innumerable ordained first father,milton-paradise
this paradise i give thee count it thine to till and keep and of the fruit to eat of every tree that in the garden grows eat freely with glad heart fear here no dearth but of the tree whose operation brings knowledge of good and ill which i have set the pledge of thy obedience and thy faith amid the garden by the tree of life remember what i warn thee shun to taste and shun the bitter consequence for know the day thou eatest thereof my sole command transgressed inevitably thou shalt die from that day mortal and this happy state shalt lose expelled from hence into a world of woe and sorrow,milton-paradise
i named them as they passed and understood their nature with such knowledge god endued my sudden apprehension but in these i found not what methought i wanted still and to the heavenly vision thus presumed,milton-paradise
what callest thou solitude,milton-paradise
let not my words offend thee heavenly power my maker be propitious while i speak,milton-paradise
a nice and subtle happiness i see thou to thyself proposest in the choice of thy associates adam,milton-paradise
how have i then with whom to hold converse save with the creatures which i made and those to me inferiour infinite descents beneath what other creatures are to thee,milton-paradise
thou in thy secresy although alone best with thyself accompanied seekest not social communication yet so pleased canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt of union or communion deified i by conversing cannot these erect from prone nor in their ways complacence find,milton-paradise
she disappeared and left me dark i waked to find her or for ever to deplore her loss and other pleasures all abjure when out of hope behold her not far off such as i saw her in my dream adorned with what all earth or heaven could bestow to make her amiable on she came led by her heavenly maker though unseen and guided by his voice nor uninformed of nuptial sanctity and marriage rites grace was in all her steps heaven in her eye in every gesture dignity and love,milton-paradise
i now see bone of my bone flesh of my flesh myself before me woman is her name of man extracted for this cause he shall forego father and mother and to his wife adhere and they shall be one flesh one heart one soul,milton-paradise
or nature failed in me and left some part not proof enough such object to sustain or from my side subducting took perhaps more than enough at least on her bestowed too much of ornament in outward show elaborate of inward less exact,milton-paradise
fair no doubt and worthy well thy cherishing thy honouring and thy love not thy subjection weigh with her thyself then value oft times nothing profits more than self esteem grounded on just and right well managed of that skill the more thou knowest the more she will acknowledge thee her head and to realities yield all her shows made so adorn for thy delight the more so awful that with honour thou mayest love thy mate who sees when thou art seen least wise,milton-paradise
yet these subject not i to thee disclose what inward thence i feel not therefore foiled who meet with various objects from the sense variously representing yet still free approve the best and follow what i approve,milton-paradise
let it suffice thee that thou knowest us happy and without love no happiness,milton-paradise
i in thy persevering shall rejoice and all the blest stand fast to stand or fall free in thine own arbitrement it lies,milton-paradise
so parted they the angel up to heaven from the thick shade and adam to his bower,milton-paradise
me of these nor skill d nor studious higher argument remains sufficient of itself to raise that name unless an age too late or cold climate or years damp my intended wing depress d and much they may if all be mine not hers who brings it nightly to my ear,milton-paradise
more justly seat worthier of gods as built with second thoughts reforming what was old,milton-paradise
but i in none of these find place or refuge and the more i see pleasures about me so much more i feel torment within me as from the hateful siege of contraries all good to me becomes bane and in heaven much worse would be my state,milton-paradise
that i who erst contended with gods to sit the highest am now constrained into a beast and mixed with bestial slime this essence to incarnate and imbrute that to the highth of deity aspired,milton-paradise
now when as sacred light began to dawn in eden on the humid flowers that breathed their morning incense when all things that breathe from the earth s great altar send up silent praise to the creator and his nostrils fill with grateful smell forth came the human pair and joined their vocal worship to the quire of creatures wanting voice that done partake the season prime for sweetest scents and airs then commune how that day they best may ply their growing work for much their work out grew the hands dispatch of two gardening so wide and eve first to her husband thus began,milton-paradise
well hast thou motioned well thy thoughts employed how we might best fulfil the work which here god hath assigned us nor of me shalt pass unpraised for nothing lovelier can be found in woman than to study houshold good and good works in her husband to promote,milton-paradise
the wife where danger or dishonour lurks safest and seemliest by her husband stays who guards her or with her the worst endures,milton-paradise
his violence thou fearest not being such as we not capable of death or pain can either not receive or can repel,milton-paradise
for he who tempts though in vain at least asperses the tempted with dishonour foul supposed not incorruptible of faith not proof against temptation thou thyself with scorn and anger wouldst resent the offered wrong though ineffectual found misdeem not then if such affront i labour to avert from thee alone which on us both at once the enemy though bold will hardly dare or daring first on me the assault shall light,milton-paradise
if this be our condition thus to dwell in narrow circuit straitened by a foe subtle or violent we not endued single with like defence wherever met how are we happy still in fear of harm,milton-paradise
frail is our happiness if this be so and eden were no eden thus exposed,milton-paradise
firm we subsist yet possible to swerve since reason not impossibly may meet some specious object by the foe suborned and fall into deception unaware not keeping strictest watch as she was warned,milton-paradise
so spake the patriarch of mankind but eve persisted yet submiss though last replied,milton-paradise
oft he to her his charge of quick return repeated she to him as oft engaged to be returned by noon amid the bower and all things in best order to invite noontide repast or afternoon s repose,milton-paradise
in bower and field he sought where any tuft of grove or garden plot more pleasant lay their tendance or plantation for delight by fountain or by shady rivulet he sought them both but wished his hap might find eve separate he wished but not with hope of what so seldom chanced when to his wish beyond his hope eve separate he spies veiled in a cloud of fragrance where she stood half spied so thick the roses blushing round about her glowed oft stooping to support each flower of slender stalk whose head though gay carnation purple azure or specked with gold hung drooping unsustained them she upstays gently with myrtle band mindless the while herself though fairest unsupported flower from her best prop so far and storm so nigh,milton-paradise
with what sweet compulsion thus transported to forget what hither brought us,milton-paradise
not terrible though terrour be in love and beauty not approached by stronger hate hate stronger under show of love well feigned the way which to her ruin now i tend,milton-paradise
as when a ship by skilful steersmen wrought nigh river s mouth or foreland where the wind veers oft as oft so steers and shifts her sail so varied he and of his tortuous train curled many a wanton wreath in sight of eve to lure her eye she busied heard the sound of rusling leaves but minded not as used to such disport before her through the field from every beast more duteous at her call than at circean call the herd disguised,milton-paradise
fairest resemblance of thy maker fair thee all things living gaze on all things thine by gift and thy celestial beauty adore with ravishment beheld,milton-paradise
what may this mean,milton-paradise
to whom the guileful tempter thus replied,milton-paradise
amid the tree now got where plenty hung tempting so nigh to pluck and eat my fill i spared not for such pleasure till that hour at feed or fountain never had i found,milton-paradise
serpent thy overpraising leaves in doubt the virtue of that fruit in thee first proved but say where grows the tree,milton-paradise
he leading swiftly rolled in tangles and made intricate seem straight to mischief swift,milton-paradise
to whom the tempter guilefully replied,milton-paradise
she scarce had said though brief when now more bold the tempter but with show of zeal and love to man and indignation at his wrong new part puts on and as to passion moved fluctuates disturbed yet comely and in act raised as of some great matter to begin,milton-paradise
queen of this universe,milton-paradise
shall that be shut to man which to the beast is open,milton-paradise
why then was this forbid,milton-paradise
and what are gods that man may not become as they participating god like food,milton-paradise
and can envy dwell in heavenly breasts,milton-paradise
but his forbidding commends thee more while it infers the good by thee communicated and our want for good unknown sure is not had or had and yet unknown is as not had at all,milton-paradise
how dies the serpent,milton-paradise
what fear i then,milton-paradise
back to the thicket slunk the guilty serpent and well might for eve intent now wholly on her taste nought else regarded such delight till then as seemed in fruit she never tasted whether true or fancied so through expectation high of knowledge not was godhead from her thought,milton-paradise
experience next to thee i owe best guide not following thee i had remained in ignorance thou openest wisdom s way and givest access though secret she retire,milton-paradise
then i shall be no more,milton-paradise
great joy he promised to his thoughts and new solace in her return so long delayed yet oft his heart divine of something ill misgave him he the faltering measure felt and forth to meet her went the way she took that morn when first they parted by the tree of knowledge he must pass there he her met scarce from the tree returning in her hand a bough of fairest fruit that downy smiled new gathered and ambrosial smell diffused,milton-paradise
for bliss as thou hast part to me is bliss tedious unshared with thee and odious soon,milton-paradise
how art thou lost,milton-paradise
should god create another eve and i another rib afford yet loss of thee would never from my heart no no i feel the link of nature draw me flesh of flesh bone of my bone thou art and from thy state mine never shall be parted bliss or woe,milton-paradise
nor can i think that god creator wise though threatening will in earnest so destroy us his prime creatures dignified so high set over all his works which in our fall for us created needs with us must fail dependant made so god shall uncreate be frustrate do undo and labour lose not well conceived of god who though his power creation could repeat yet would be loth us to abolish lest the adversary triumph and say fickle their state whom god most favours who can please him long,milton-paradise
o glorious trial of exceeding love illustrious evidence example high,milton-paradise
in recompence for such compliance bad such recompence best merits from the bough she gave him of that fair enticing fruit with liberal hand he scrupled not to eat against his better knowledge not deceived but fondly overcome with female charm,milton-paradise
so said he and forbore not glance or toy of amorous intent well understood of eve whose eye darted contagious fire,milton-paradise
o eve in evil hour thou didst give ear to that false worm of whomsoever taught to counterfeit man s voice true in our fall false in our promised rising since our eyes opened we find indeed and find we know both good and evil good lost and evil got bad fruit of knowledge if this be to know which leaves us naked thus of honour void of innocence of faith of purity our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained and in our faces evident the signs of foul concupiscence whence evil store even shame the last of evils of the first be sure then how shall i behold the face henceforth of god or angel erst with joy and rapture so oft beheld,milton-paradise
so counselled he and both together went into the thickest wood there soon they chose the fig tree not that kind for fruit renowned but such as at this day to indians known in malabar or decan spreads her arms branching so broad and long that in the ground the bended twigs take root and daughters grow about the mother tree a pillared shade high over arched and echoing walks between there oft the indian herdsman shunning heat shelters in cool and tends his pasturing herds at loop holes cut through thickest shade those leaves they gathered broad as amazonian targe and with what skill they had together sewed to gird their waist vain covering if to hide their guilt and dreaded shame,milton-paradise
let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve the faith they owe when earnestly they seek such proof conclude they then begin to fail,milton-paradise
was i to have never parted from thy side,milton-paradise
to whom then first incensed adam replied,milton-paradise
but confidence then bore thee on secure either to meet no danger or to find matter of glorious trial and perhaps i also erred in overmuch admiring what seemed in thee so perfect that i thought no evil durst attempt thee but i rue the errour now which is become my crime and thou the accuser,milton-paradise
who in all things wise and just hindered not satan to attempt the mind of man with strength entire and free will armed complete to have discovered and repulsed whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend,milton-paradise
about the new arrived in multitudes the ethereal people ran to hear and know how all befel they towards the throne supreme accountable made haste to make appear with righteous plea their utmost vigilance and easily approved when the most high eternal father from his secret cloud amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice,milton-paradise
justice shall not return as bounty scorned,milton-paradise
so spake the father and unfolding bright toward the right hand his glory on the son blazed forth unclouded deity he full resplendent all his father manifest expressed and thus divinely answered mild,milton-paradise
down he descended straight the speed of gods time counts not though with swiftest minutes winged,milton-paradise
whence adam faltering long thus answered brief,milton-paradise
hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat,milton-paradise
was she thy god that her thou didst obey before his voice,milton-paradise
to whom sad eve with shame nigh overwhelmed confessing soon yet not before her judge bold or loquacious thus abashed replied,milton-paradise
so spake this oracle then verified when jesus son of mary second eve saw satan fall like lightning down from heaven prince of the air then rising from his grave spoiled principalities and powers triumphed in open show and with ascension bright captivity led captive through the air the realm itself of satan long usurped whom he shall tread at last under our feet even he who now foretold his fatal bruise and to the woman thus his sentence turned,milton-paradise
opprobrious with his robe of righteousness arraying covered from his father s sight,milton-paradise
methinks i feel new strength within me rise wings growing and dominion given me large beyond this deep whatever draws me on or sympathy or some connatural force powerful at greatest distance to unite with secret amity things of like kind by secretest conveyance,milton-paradise
go whither fate and inclination strong leads thee i shall not lag behind nor err the way thou leading such a scent i draw of carnage prey innumerable and taste the savour of death from all things there that live nor shall i to the work thou enterprisest be wanting but afford thee equal aid,milton-paradise
so if great things to small may be compared xerxes the liberty of greece to yoke from susa his memnonian palace high came to the sea and over hellespont bridging his way europe with asia joined and scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves,milton-paradise
he after eve seduced unminded slunk into the wood fast by and changing shape to observe the sequel saw his guileful act by eve though all unweeting seconded upon her husband saw their shame that sought vain covertures but when he saw descend the son of god to judge them terrified he fled not hoping to escape but shun the present fearing guilty what his wrath might suddenly inflict that past returned by night and listening where the hapless pair sat in their sad discourse and various plaint thence gathered his own doom which understood not instant but of future time with joy and tidings fraught to hell he now returned and at the brink of chaos near the foot of this new wonderous pontifice unhoped met who to meet him came his offspring dear,milton-paradise
hell could no longer hold us in our bounds nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure detain from following thy illustrious track,milton-paradise
therefore while i descend through darkness on your road with ease to my associate powers them to acquaint with these successes and with them rejoice you two this way among these numerous orbs all yours right down to paradise descend there dwell and reign in bliss thence on the earth dominion exercise and in the air chiefly on man sole lord of all declared him first make sure your thrall and lastly kill,milton-paradise
as when the tartar from his russian foe by astracan over the snowy plains retires or bactrin sophi from the horns of turkish crescent leaves all waste beyond the realm of aladule in his retreat to tauris or casbeen so these the late heaven banished host left desart utmost hell many a dark league reduced in careful watch round their metropolis and now expecting each hour their great adventurer from the search of foreign worlds he through the midst unmarked in show plebeian angel militant of lowest order passed and from the door of that plutonian hall invisible ascended his high throne which under state of richest texture spread at the upper end was placed in regal lustre,milton-paradise
hath given up both his beloved man and all his world to sin and death a prey and so to us without our hazard labour or alarm to range in and to dwell and over man to rule as over all he should have ruled,milton-paradise
there stood a grove hard by sprung up with this their change his will who reigns above to aggravate their penance laden with fair fruit like that which grew in paradise the bait of eve used by the tempter on that prospect strange their earnest eyes they fixed imagining for one forbidden tree a multitude now risen to work them further woe or shame yet parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce though to delude them sent could not abstain but on they rolled in heaps and up the trees climbing sat thicker than the snaky locks that curled megaera greedily they plucked the fruitage fair to sight like that which grew near that bituminous lake where sodom flamed this more delusive not the touch but taste deceived they fondly thinking to allay their appetite with gust instead of fruit chewed bitter ashes which the offended taste with spattering noise rejected oft they assayed hunger and thirst constraining drugged as oft with hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws with soot and cinders filled so oft they fell into the same illusion not as man whom they triumphed once lapsed,milton-paradise
what thinkest thou of our empire now though earned with travel difficult not better far than still at hell s dark threshold to have sat watch unnamed undreaded and thyself half starved,milton-paradise
and whatever thing the sithe of time mows down devour unspared till i in man residing through the race his thoughts his looks words actions all infect and season him thy last and sweetest prey,milton-paradise
next to the son destined restorer of mankind by whom new heaven and earth shall to the ages rise or down from heaven descend such was their song while the creator calling forth by name his mighty angels gave them several charge as sorted best with present things,milton-paradise
these changes in the heavens though slow produced like change on sea and land sideral blast vapour and mist and exhalation hot corrupt and pestilent now from the north of norumbega and the samoed shore bursting their brazen dungeon armed with ice and snow and hail and stormy gust and flaw boreas and caecias and argestes loud and thrascias rend the woods and seas upturn with adverse blast upturns them from the south notus and afer black with thunderous clouds from serraliona thwart of these as fierce forth rush the levant and the ponent winds eurus and zephyr with their lateral noise sirocco and libecchio,milton-paradise
hide me from the face of god whom to behold was then my highth of happiness yet well if here would end the misery i deserved it and would bear my own deservings but this will not serve all that i eat or drink or shall beget is propagated curse,milton-paradise
but his thanks shall be the execration so besides mine own that bide upon me all from me shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound on me as on their natural center light heavy though in their place,milton-paradise
to the loss of that sufficient penalty why hast thou added the sense of endless woes,milton-paradise
yet one doubt pursues me still lest all i cannot die lest that pure breath of life the spirit of man which god inspired cannot together perish with this corporeal clod then in the grave or in some other dismal place who knows but i shall die a living death,milton-paradise
for though the lord of all be infinite is his wrath also,milton-paradise
will he draw out for anger s sake finite to infinite in punished man to satisfy his rigour satisfied never,milton-paradise
ah why should all mankind for one man s fault thus guiltless be condemned it guiltless,milton-paradise
thus what thou desirest and what thou fearest alike destroys all hope of refuge and concludes thee miserable beyond all past example and future to satan only like both crime and doom,milton-paradise
shall truth fail to keep her word justice divine not hasten to be just,milton-paradise
but for thee i had persisted happy had not thy pride and wandering vanity when least was safe rejected my forewarning and disdained not to be trusted longing to be seen though by the devil himself him overweening to over reach but with the serpent meeting fooled and beguiled by him thou i by thee to trust thee from my side imagined wise constant mature proof against all assaults and understood not all was but a show rather than solid virtue all but a rib crooked by nature bent as now appears more to the part sinister from me drawn well if thrown out as supernumerary to my just number found,milton-paradise
forsake me not thus adam,milton-paradise
she ended weeping and her lowly plight immoveable till peace obtained from fault acknowledged and deplored in adam wrought commiseration soon his heart relented towards her his life so late and sole delight now at his feet submissive in distress creature so fair his reconcilement seeking his counsel whom she had displeased his aid as one disarmed his anger all he lost and thus with peaceful words upraised her soon,milton-paradise
derived,milton-paradise
but if thou judge it hard and difficult conversing looking loving to abstain from love s due rights nuptial embraces sweet and with desire to languish without hope before the present object languishing with like desire which would be misery and torment less than none of what we dread then both ourselves and seed at once to free from what we fear for both let us make short let us seek death or he not found supply with our own hands his office on ourselves why stand we longer shivering under fears that show no end but death and have the power of many ways to die the shortest choosing destruction with destruction to destroy,milton-paradise
unless be meant whom i conjecture our grand foe satan who in the serpent hath contrived against us this deceit to crush his head would be revenge indeed,milton-paradise
which now the sky with various face begins to show us in this mountain while the winds blow moist and keen shattering the graceful locks of these fair spreading trees which bids us seek some better shroud some better warmth to cherish our limbs benummed ere this diurnal star leave cold the night how we his gathered beams reflected may with matter sere foment or by collision of two bodies grind the air attrite to fire as late the clouds justling or pushed with winds rude in their shock tine the slant lightning whose thwart flame driven down kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine and sends a comfortable heat from far which might supply the sun such fire to use and what may else be remedy or cure to evils which our own misdeeds have wrought he will instruct us praying and of grace beseeching him so as we need not fear to pass commodiously this life sustained by him with many comforts till we end in dust our final rest and native home,milton-paradise
thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood praying for from the mercy seat above prevenient grace descending had removed the stony from their hearts and made new flesh regenerate grow instead that sighs now breathed unutterable which the spirit of prayer inspired and winged for heaven with speedier flight than loudest oratory yet their port not of mean suitors nor important less seemed their petition than when the ancient pair in fables old less ancient yet than these deucalion and chaste pyrrha to restore the race of mankind drowned before the shrine of themis stood devout,milton-paradise
to whom the father without cloud serene,milton-paradise
the angelick blast filled all the regions from their blisful bowers of amarantine shade fountain or spring by the waters of life where er they sat in fellowships of joy the sons of light hasted resorting to the summons high and took their seats till from his throne supreme the almighty thus pronounced his sovran will,milton-paradise
michael this my behest have thou in charge take to thee from among the cherubim thy choice of flaming warriours lest the fiend or in behalf of man or to invade vacant possession some new trouble raise haste thee and from the paradise of god without remorse drive out the sinful pair from hallowed ground the unholy and denounce to them and to their progeny from thence perpetual banishment,milton-paradise
eve easily my faith admit that all the good which we enjoy from heaven descends but that from us aught should ascend to heaven so prevalent as to concern the mind of god high blest or to incline his will hard to belief may seem yet this will prayer or one short sigh of human breath upborne even to the seat of god,milton-paradise
but the field to labour calls us now with sweat imposed though after sleepless night for see the morn all unconcerned with our unrest begins her rosy progress smiling let us forth i never from thy side henceforth to stray where er our day s work lies though now enjoined laborious till day droop while here we dwell what can be toilsome in these pleasant walks,milton-paradise
or more than this that we are dust and thither must return and be no more,milton-paradise
the princely hierarch in their bright stand there left his powers to seise possession of the garden he alone to find where adam sheltered took his way not unperceived of adam who to eve while the great visitant approached thus spake,milton-paradise
adam heaven s high behest no preface needs sufficient that thy prayers are heard and death then due by sentence when thou didst transgress defeated of his seisure many days given thee of grace wherein thou mayest repent and one bad act with many deeds well done mayest cover well may then thy lord appeased redeem thee quite from death s rapacious claim but longer in this paradise to dwell permits not to remove thee i am come and send thee from the garden forth to till the ground whence thou wast taken fitter soil,milton-paradise
these happy walks and shades fit haunt of gods,milton-paradise
by me adorned with what to sight or smell was sweet,milton-paradise
adam by this from the cold sudden damp recovering and his scattered spirits returned to michael thus his humble words addressed,milton-paradise
for though i fled him angry yet recalled to life prolonged and promised race i now gladly behold though but his utmost skirts of glory and far off his steps adore,milton-paradise
to whom thus adam gratefully replied,milton-paradise
his eye might there command wherever stood city of old or modern fame the seat of mightiest empire from the destined walls of cambalu seat of cathaian can and samarchand by oxus temir s throne to paquin of sinaean kings and thence to agra and lahor of great mogul down to the golden chersonese or where the persian in ecbatan sat or since in hispahan or where the russian ksar in mosco or the sultan in bizance turchestan born nor could his eye not ken the empire of negus to his utmost port ercoco and the less maritim kings mombaza and quiloa and melind and sofala thought ophir to the realm of congo and angola farthest south or thence from niger flood to atlas mount the kingdoms of almansor fez and sus morocco and algiers and tremisen on europe thence and where rome was to sway the world in spirit perhaps he also saw rich mexico the seat of montezume and cusco in peru the richer seat of atabalipa and yet unspoiled guiana whose great city geryon s sons call el dorado,milton-paradise
much at that sight was adam in his heart dismayed and thus in haste to the angel cried,milton-paradise
alas,milton-paradise
to whom thus michael,milton-paradise
sight so deform what heart of rock could long dry eyed behold,milton-paradise
rather why obtruded on us thus,milton-paradise
therefore so abject is their punishment disfiguring not god s likeness but their own or if his likeness by themselves defaced while they pervert pure nature s healthful rules to loathsome sickness worthily since they god s image did not reverence in themselves,milton-paradise
henceforth i fly not death nor would prolong life much bent rather how i may be quit fairest and easiest of this cumbrous charge which i must keep till my appointed day of rendering up and patiently attend my dissolution,milton-paradise
after these but on the hither side a different sort from the high neighbouring hills which was their seat down to the plain descended by their guise just men they seemed and all their study bent to worship god aright and know his works not hid nor those things last which might preserve freedom and peace to men they on the plain long had not walked when from the tents behold,milton-paradise
judge not what is best by pleasure though to nature seeming meet created as thou art to nobler end holy and pure conformity divine,milton-paradise
but still i see the tenour of man s woe holds on the same from woman to begin,milton-paradise
adam was all in tears and to his guide lamenting turned full sad o what are these death s ministers not men,milton-paradise
thus fame shall be achieved renown on earth and what most merits fame in silence hid,milton-paradise
mean while the south wind rose and with black wings wide hovering all the clouds together drove from under heaven the hills to their supply vapour and exhalation dusk and moist sent up amain and now the thickened sky like a dark cieling stood down rushed the rain impetuous and continued till the earth no more was seen the floating vessel swum uplifted and secure with beaked prow rode tilting o er the waves all dwellings else flood overwhelmed and them with all their pomp deep under water rolled sea covered sea sea without shore and in their palaces where luxury late reigned sea monsters whelped and stabled of mankind so numerous late all left in one small bottom swum imbarked,milton-paradise
so had borne my part of evil only each day s lot enough to bear those now that were dispensed the burden of many ages on me light at once by my foreknowledge gaining birth abortive to torment me ere their being with thought that they must be,milton-paradise
those whom last thou sawest in triumph and luxurious wealth are they first seen in acts of prowess eminent and great exploits but of true virtue void who having spilt much blood and done much wast subduing nations and achieved thereby fame in the world high titles and rich prey shall change their course to pleasure ease and sloth surfeit and lust till wantonness and pride raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace,milton-paradise
the ark no more now floats but seems on ground fast on the top of some high mountain fixed,milton-paradise
i revive at this last sight assured that man shall live with all the creatures and their seed preserve,milton-paradise
dextrously thou aimest so willingly doth god remit his ire though late repenting him of man depraved grieved at his heart when looking down he saw the whole earth filled with violence and all flesh corrupting each their way yet those removed such grace shall one just man find in his sight that he relents not to blot out mankind and makes a covenant never to destroy the earth again by flood nor let the sea surpass his bounds nor rain to drown the world with man therein or beast but when he brings over the earth a cloud will therein set his triple coloured bow whereon to look and call to mind his covenant day and night seed time and harvest heat and hoary frost shall hold their course till fire purge all things new both heaven and earth wherein the just shall dwell,milton-paradise
this second source of men while yet but few and while the dread of judgement past remains fresh in their minds fearing the deity with some regard to what is just and right shall lead their lives and multiply apace labouring the soil and reaping plenteous crop corn wine and oil and from the herd or flock oft sacrificing bullock lamb or kid with large wine offerings poured and sacred feast shall spend their days in joy unblamed and dwell long time in peace by families and tribes under paternal rule till one shall rise of proud ambitious heart who not content with fair equality fraternal state will arrogate dominion undeserved over his brethren and quite dispossess concord and law of nature from the earth hunting and men not beasts shall be his game with war and hostile snare such as refuse subjection to his empire tyrannous a mighty hunter thence he shall be styled before the lord as in despite of heaven or from heaven claiming second sovranty and from rebellion shall derive his name though of rebellion others he accuse,milton-paradise
so to aspire above his brethren to himself assuming authority usurped from god not given he gave us only over beast fish fowl dominion absolute that right we hold by his donation but man over men he made not lord such title to himself reserving human left from human free,milton-paradise
yet sometimes nations will decline so low from virtue which is reason that no wrong but justice and some fatal curse annexed deprives them of their outward liberty their inward lost witness the irreverent son of him who built the ark who for the shame done to his father heard this heavy curse servant of servants on his vicious race,milton-paradise
this ponder that all nations of the earth shall in his seed be blessed by that seed is meant thy great deliverer who shall bruise the serpent s head whereof to thee anon plainlier shall be revealed,milton-paradise
thus with ten wounds the river dragon tamed at length submits to let his sojourners depart and oft humbles his stubborn heart but still as ice more hardened after thaw till in his rage pursuing whom he late dismissed the sea swallows him with his host but them lets pass as on dry land between two crystal walls awed by the rod of moses so to stand divided till his rescued gain their shore such wondrous power god to his saint will lend though present in his angel who shall go before them in a cloud and pillar of fire by day a cloud by night a pillar of fire to guide them in their journey and remove behind them while the obdurate king pursues all night he will pursue but his approach darkness defends between till morning watch then through the fiery pillar and the cloud god looking forth will trouble all his host and craze their chariot wheels when by command moses once more his potent rod extends over the sea the sea his rod obeys on their embattled ranks the waves return and overwhelm their war the race elect safe toward canaan from the shore advance through the wild desart not the readiest way lest entering on the canaanite alarmed war terrify them inexpert and fear return them back to egypt choosing rather inglorious life with servitude for life to noble and ignoble is more sweet untrained in arms where rashness leads not on,milton-paradise
here adam interposed,milton-paradise
so law appears imperfect and but given with purpose to resign them in full time up to a better covenant disciplined from shadowy types to truth from flesh to spirit from imposition of strict laws to free acceptance of large grace from servile fear to filial works of law to works of faith,milton-paradise
there in captivity he lets them dwell the space of seventy years then brings them back remembering mercy and his covenant sworn to david stablished as the days of heaven,milton-paradise
now clear i understand what oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain why our great expectation should be called the seed of woman virgin mother hail high in the love of heaven yet from my loins thou shalt proceed and from thy womb the son of god most high so god with man unites,milton-paradise
for this he shall live hated be blasphemed seised on by force judged and to death condemned a shameful and accursed nailed to the cross by his own nation slain for bringing life but to the cross he nails thy enemies the law that is against thee and the sins of all mankind with him there crucified never to hurt them more who rightly trust in this his satisfaction so he dies but soon revives death over him no power shall long usurp ere the third dawning light return the stars of morn shall see him rise out of his grave fresh as the dawning light thy ransom paid which man from death redeems his death for man as many as offered life neglect not and the benefit embrace by faith not void of works this god like act annuls thy doom the death thou shouldest have died in sin for ever lost from life this act shall bruise the head of satan crush his strength defeating sin and death his two main arms and fix far deeper in his head their stings than temporal death shall bruise the victor s heel or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep a gentle wafting to immortal life,milton-paradise
o goodness infinite goodness immense,milton-paradise
will they not deal worse with his followers than with him they dealt,milton-paradise
what but unbuild his living temples built by faith to stand their own faith not another s,milton-paradise
beyond is all abyss eternity whose end no eye can reach,milton-paradise
he ended and they both descend the hill descended adam to the bower where eve lay sleeping ran before but found her waked and thus with words not sad she him received,milton-paradise
they looking back all the eastern side beheld of paradise so late their happy seat waved over by that flaming brand the gate with dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms some natural tears they dropt but wiped them soon the world was all before them where to choose their place of rest and providence their guide they hand in hand with wandering steps and slow through eden took their solitary way,milton-paradise
